24Jr 1:1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
24Jr 1:2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
24Jr 1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
24Jr 1:4 Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24Jr 1:5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."
24Jr 1:6 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth."
24Jr 1:7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
24Jr 1:8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the LORD."
24Jr 1:9 Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
24Jr 1:10 See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."
24Jr 1:11 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see an almond branch."
24Jr 1:12 Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."
24Jr 1:13 The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."
24Jr 1:14 Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.
24Jr 1:15 For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.
24Jr 1:16 And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands.
24Jr 1:17 But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.
24Jr 1:18 And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
24Jr 1:19 They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you."
24Jr 2:1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24Jr 2:2 "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, "I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
24Jr 2:3 Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest. All who ate of it incurred guilt; disaster came upon them, declares the LORD."
24Jr 2:4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
24Jr 2:5 Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?
24Jr 2:6 They did not say, 'Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'
24Jr 2:7 And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.
24Jr 2:8 The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the shepherds transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit.
24Jr 2:9 "Therefore I still contend with you, declares the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.
24Jr 2:10 For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.
24Jr 2:11 Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
24Jr 2:12 Be appalled, O heavens, at this; be shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the LORD,
24Jr 2:13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
24Jr 2:14 "Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?
24Jr 2:15 The lions have roared against him; they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.
24Jr 2:16 Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.
24Jr 2:17 Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?
24Jr 2:18 And now what do you gain by going to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24Jr 2:19 Your evil will chastise you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
24Jr 2:20 "For long ago I broke your yoke and burst your bonds; but you said, 'I will not serve.' Yes, on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down like a whore.
24Jr 2:21 Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?
24Jr 2:22 Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the Lord GOD.
24Jr 2:23 How can you say, 'I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done-- a restless young camel running here and there,
24Jr 2:24 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
24Jr 2:25 Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is hopeless, for I have loved foreigners, and after them I will go.'
24Jr 2:26 "As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,
24Jr 2:27 who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' and to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, 'Arise and save us!'
24Jr 2:28 But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.
24Jr 2:29 "Why do you contend with me? You have all transgressed against me, declares the LORD.
24Jr 2:30 In vain have I struck your children; they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
24Jr 2:31 And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, 'We are free, we will come no more to you'?
24Jr 2:32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
24Jr 2:33 "How well you direct your course to seek love! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.
24Jr 2:34 Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things
24Jr 2:35 you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, 'I have not sinned.'
24Jr 2:36 How much you go about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
24Jr 2:37 From it too you will come away with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.
24Jr 3:1 "If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not that land be greatly polluted? You have played the whore with many lovers; and would you return to me? declares the LORD.
24Jr 3:2 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom.
24Jr 3:3 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have the forehead of a whore; you refuse to be ashamed.
24Jr 3:4 Have you not just now called to me, 'My father, you are the friend of my youth--
24Jr 3:5 will he be angry forever, will he be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could."
24Jr 3:6 The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah: "Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the whore?
24Jr 3:7 And I thought, 'After she has done all this she will return to me,' but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
24Jr 3:8 She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.
24Jr 3:9 Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.
24Jr 3:10 Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD."
24Jr 3:11 And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
24Jr 3:12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, "'Return, faithless Israel, declares the LORD. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, declares the LORD; I will not be angry forever.
24Jr 3:13 Only acknowledge your guilt, that you rebelled against the LORD your God and scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree, and that you have not obeyed my voice, declares the LORD.
24Jr 3:14 Return, O faithless children, declares the LORD; for I am your master; I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
24Jr 3:15 "'And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
24Jr 3:16 And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.
24Jr 3:17 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.
24Jr 3:18 In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.
24Jr 3:19 "'I said, How I would set you among my sons, and give you a pleasant land, a heritage most beautiful of all nations. And I thought you would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me.
24Jr 3:20 Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband, so have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel, declares the LORD.'"
24Jr 3:21 A voice on the bare heights is heard, the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God.
24Jr 3:22 "Return, O faithless sons; I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to you, for you are the LORD our God.
24Jr 3:23 Truly the hills are a delusion, the orgies on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
24Jr 3:24 "But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
24Jr 3:25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
24Jr 4:1 "If you return, O Israel, declares the LORD, to me you should return. If you remove your detestable things from my presence, and do not waver,
24Jr 4:2 and if you swear, 'As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."
24Jr 4:3 For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
24Jr 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds."
24Jr 4:5 Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet through the land; cry aloud and say, 'Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!'
24Jr 4:6 Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, stay not, for I bring disaster from the north, and great destruction.
24Jr 4:7 A lion has gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.
24Jr 4:8 For this put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."
24Jr 4:9 "In that day, declares the LORD, courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."
24Jr 4:10 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It shall be well with you,' whereas the sword has reached their very life."
24Jr 4:11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,
24Jr 4:12 a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."
24Jr 4:13 Behold, he comes up like clouds; his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles-- woe to us, for we are ruined!
24Jr 4:14 O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil, that you may be saved. How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you?
24Jr 4:15 For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.
24Jr 4:16 Warn the nations that he is coming; announce to Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.
24Jr 4:17 Like keepers of a field are they against her all around, because she has rebelled against me, declares the LORD.
24Jr 4:18 Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."
24Jr 4:19 My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent, for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
24Jr 4:20 Crash follows hard on crash; the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
24Jr 4:21 How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
24Jr 4:22 "For my people are foolish; they know me not; they are stupid children; they have no understanding. They are 'wise'--in doing evil! But how to do good they know not."
24Jr 4:23 I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.
24Jr 4:24 I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.
24Jr 4:25 I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.
24Jr 4:26 I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.
24Jr 4:27 For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.
24Jr 4:28 "For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark; for I have spoken; I have purposed; I have not relented, nor will I turn back."
24Jr 4:29 At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.
24Jr 4:30 And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.
24Jr 4:31 For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers."
24Jr 5:1 Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note! Search her squares to see if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth, that I may pardon her.
24Jr 5:2 Though they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.
24Jr 5:3 O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.
24Jr 5:4 Then I said, "These are only the poor; they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.
24Jr 5:5 I will go to the great and will speak to them, for they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God." But they all alike had broken the yoke; they had burst the bonds.
24Jr 5:6 Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down; a wolf from the desert shall devastate them. A leopard is watching their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.
24Jr 5:7 "How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of whores.
24Jr 5:8 They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor's wife.
24Jr 5:9 Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD; and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?
24Jr 5:10 "Go up through her vine rows and destroy, but make not a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the LORD's.
24Jr 5:11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous to me, declares the LORD.
24Jr 5:12 They have spoken falsely of the LORD and have said, 'He will do nothing; no disaster will come upon us, nor shall we see sword or famine.
24Jr 5:13 The prophets will become wind; the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!'"
24Jr 5:14 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: "Because you have spoken this word, behold, I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall consume them.
24Jr 5:15 Behold, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, declares the LORD. It is an enduring nation; it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
24Jr 5:16 Their quiver is like an open tomb; they are all mighty warriors.
24Jr 5:17 They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; your fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword."
24Jr 5:18 "But even in those days, declares the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.
24Jr 5:19 And when your people say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.'"
24Jr 5:20 Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah:
24Jr 5:21 "Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but see not, who have ears, but hear not.
24Jr 5:22 Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it.
24Jr 5:23 But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.
24Jr 5:24 They do not say in their hearts, 'Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest.'
24Jr 5:25 Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have kept good from you.
24Jr 5:26 For wicked men are found among my people; they lurk like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
24Jr 5:27 Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and rich;
24Jr 5:28 they have grown fat and sleek. They know no bounds in deeds of evil; they judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
24Jr 5:29 Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?"
24Jr 5:30 An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:
24Jr 5:31 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their direction; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?
24Jr 6:1 Flee for safety, O people of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem, for disaster looms out of the north, and great destruction.
24Jr 6:2 The lovely and delicately bred I will destroy, the daughter of Zion.
24Jr 6:3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents around her; they shall pasture, each in his place.
24Jr 6:4 "Prepare war against her; arise, and let us attack at noon! Woe to us, for the day declines, for the shadows of evening lengthen!
24Jr 6:5 Arise, and let us attack by night and destroy her palaces!"
24Jr 6:6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "Cut down her trees; cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.
24Jr 6:7 As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her evil; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.
24Jr 6:8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I turn from you in disgust, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land."
24Jr 6:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "They shall glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer pass your hand again over its branches."
24Jr 6:10 To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, they cannot listen; behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.
24Jr 6:11 Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. "Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men, also; both husband and wife shall be taken, the elderly and the very aged.
24Jr 6:12 Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD.
24Jr 6:13 "For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 6:14 They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
24Jr 6:15 Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown," says the LORD.
24Jr 6:16 Thus says the LORD: "Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'
24Jr 6:17 I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Pay attention to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not pay attention.'
24Jr 6:18 Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.
24Jr 6:19 Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing disaster upon this people, the fruit of their devices, because they have not paid attention to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
24Jr 6:20 What use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
24Jr 6:21 Therefore thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will lay before this people stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble; fathers and sons together, neighbor and friend shall perish.'"
24Jr 6:22 Thus says the LORD: "Behold, a people is coming from the north country, a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
24Jr 6:23 They lay hold on bow and javelin; they are cruel and have no mercy; the sound of them is like the roaring sea; they ride on horses, set in array as a man for battle, against you, O daughter of Zion!"
24Jr 6:24 We have heard the report of it; our hands fall helpless; anguish has taken hold of us, pain as of a woman in labor.
24Jr 6:25 Go not out into the field, nor walk on the road, for the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.
24Jr 6:26 O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
24Jr 6:27 "I have made you a tester of metals among my people, that you may know and test their ways.
24Jr 6:28 They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about with slanders; they are bronze and iron; all of them act corruptly.
24Jr 6:29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed.
24Jr 6:30 Rejected silver they are called, for the LORD has rejected them."
24Jr 7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 7:2 "Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the LORD.
24Jr 7:3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.
24Jr 7:4 Do not trust in these deceptive words: 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'
24Jr 7:5 "For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly execute justice one with another,
24Jr 7:6 if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm,
24Jr 7:7 then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever.
24Jr 7:8 "Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail.
24Jr 7:9 Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,
24Jr 7:10 and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, 'We are delivered!'--only to go on doing all these abominations?
24Jr 7:11 Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD.
24Jr 7:12 Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel.
24Jr 7:13 And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,
24Jr 7:14 therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
24Jr 7:15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim.
24Jr 7:16 "As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.
24Jr 7:17 Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 7:18 The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
24Jr 7:19 Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame?
24Jr 7:20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched."
24Jr 7:21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.
24Jr 7:22 For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
24Jr 7:23 But this command I gave them: 'Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.'
24Jr 7:24 But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward.
24Jr 7:25 From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day.
24Jr 7:26 Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.
24Jr 7:27 "So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
24Jr 7:28 And you shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.
24Jr 7:29 "'Cut off your hair and cast it away; raise a lamentation on the bare heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.'
24Jr 7:30 "For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
24Jr 7:31 And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.
24Jr 7:32 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere.
24Jr 7:33 And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away.
24Jr 7:34 And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.
24Jr 8:1 "At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs.
24Jr 8:2 And they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. And they shall not be gathered or buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 8:3 Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 8:4 "You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: When men fall, do they not rise again? If one turns away, does he not return?
24Jr 8:5 Why then has this people turned away in perpetual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.
24Jr 8:6 I have paid attention and listened, but they have not spoken rightly; no man relents of his evil, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turns to his own course, like a horse plunging headlong into battle.
24Jr 8:7 Even the stork in the heavens knows her times, and the turtledove, swallow, and crane keep the time of their coming, but my people know not the rules of the LORD.
24Jr 8:8 "How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.
24Jr 8:9 The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken; behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?
24Jr 8:10 Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to conquerors, because from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for unjust gain; from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 8:11 They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
24Jr 8:12 Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the LORD.
24Jr 8:13 When I would gather them, declares the LORD, there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree; even the leaves are withered, and what I gave them has passed away from them."
24Jr 8:14 Why do we sit still? Gather together; let us go into the fortified cities and perish there, for the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 8:15 We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
24Jr 8:16 "The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their stallions the whole land quakes. They come and devour the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it.
24Jr 8:17 For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders that cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you," declares the LORD.
24Jr 8:18 My joy is gone; grief is upon me; my heart is sick within me.
24Jr 8:19 Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people from the length and breadth of the land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?" "Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and with their foreign idols?"
24Jr 8:20 "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."
24Jr 8:21 For the wound of the daughter of my people is my heart wounded; I mourn, and dismay has taken hold on me.
24Jr 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
24Jr 9:1  Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
24Jr 9:2  Oh that I had in the desert a travelers' lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, a company of treacherous men.
24Jr 9:3 They bend their tongue like a bow; falsehood and not truth has grown strong in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, declares the LORD.
24Jr 9:4 Let everyone beware of his neighbor, and put no trust in any brother, for every brother is a deceiver, and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
24Jr 9:5 Everyone deceives his neighbor, and no one speaks the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves committing iniquity.
24Jr 9:6 Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit, they refuse to know me, declares the LORD.
24Jr 9:7 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will refine them and test them, for what else can I do, because of my people?
24Jr 9:8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully; with his mouth each speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he plans an ambush for him.
24Jr 9:9 Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?
24Jr 9:10 "I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, and the lowing of cattle is not heard; both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled and are gone.
24Jr 9:11 I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair of jackals, and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."
24Jr 9:12 Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
24Jr 9:13 And the LORD says: "Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,
24Jr 9:14 but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.
24Jr 9:15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them poisonous water to drink.
24Jr 9:16 I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them."
24Jr 9:17 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skillful women to come;
24Jr 9:18 let them make haste and raise a wailing over us, that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids flow with water.
24Jr 9:19 For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How we are ruined! We are utterly shamed, because we have left the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.'"
24Jr 9:20 Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; teach to your daughters a lament, and each to her neighbor a dirge.
24Jr 9:21 For death has come up into our windows; it has entered our palaces, cutting off the children from the streets and the young men from the squares.
24Jr 9:22 Speak, "Thus declares the LORD: 'The dead bodies of men shall fall like dung upon the open field, like sheaves after the reaper, and none shall gather them.'"
24Jr 9:23 Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,
24Jr 9:24 but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD."
24Jr 9:25 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh--
24Jr 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."
24Jr 10:1 Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
24Jr 10:2 Thus says the LORD: "Learn not the way of the nations, nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens because the nations are dismayed at them,
24Jr 10:3 for the customs of the peoples are vanity. A tree from the forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.
24Jr 10:4 They decorate it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move.
24Jr 10:5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good."
24Jr 10:6 There is none like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.
24Jr 10:7 Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? For this is your due; for among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you.
24Jr 10:8 They are both stupid and foolish; the instruction of idols is but wood!
24Jr 10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; their clothing is violet and purple; they are all the work of skilled men.
24Jr 10:10 But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.
24Jr 10:11 Thus shall you say to them: "The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
24Jr 10:12 It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 10:13 When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 10:14 Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are false, and there is no breath in them.
24Jr 10:15 They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
24Jr 10:16 Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.
24Jr 10:17 Gather up your bundle from the ground, O you who dwell under siege!
24Jr 10:18 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress on them, that they may feel it."
24Jr 10:19 Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous. But I said, "Truly this is an affliction, and I must bear it."
24Jr 10:20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone from me, and they are not; there is no one to spread my tent again and to set up my curtains.
24Jr 10:21 For the shepherds are stupid and do not inquire of the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
24Jr 10:22 A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes!-- a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals.
24Jr 10:23 I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
24Jr 10:24 Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
24Jr 10:25 Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not, and on the peoples that call not on your name, for they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
24Jr 11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 11:2 "Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:3 You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
24Jr 11:4 that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
24Jr 11:5 that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day." Then I answered, "So be it, LORD."
24Jr 11:6 And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
24Jr 11:7 For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice.
24Jr 11:8 Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not."
24Jr 11:9 Again the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
24Jr 11:11 Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
24Jr 11:12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
24Jr 11:13 For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal.
24Jr 11:14 "Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
24Jr 11:15 What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?
24Jr 11:16 The LORD once called you 'a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.' But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.
24Jr 11:17 The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal."
24Jr 11:18 The LORD made it known to me and I knew; then you showed me their deeds.
24Jr 11:19 But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I did not know it was against me they devised schemes, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more."
24Jr 11:20 But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause.
24Jr 11:21 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand"--
24Jr 11:22 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
24Jr 11:23 and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment."
24Jr 12:1 Righteous are you, O LORD, when I complain to you; yet I would plead my case before you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?
24Jr 12:2 You plant them, and they take root; they grow and produce fruit; you are near in their mouth and far from their heart.
24Jr 12:3 But you, O LORD, know me; you see me, and test my heart toward you. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter.
24Jr 12:4 How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? For the evil of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are swept away, because they said, "He will not see our latter end."
24Jr 12:5 "If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses? And if in a safe land you are so trusting, what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?
24Jr 12:6 For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; they are in full cry after you; do not believe them, though they speak friendly words to you."
24Jr 12:7 "I have forsaken my house; I have abandoned my heritage; I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.
24Jr 12:8 My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest; she has lifted up her voice against me; therefore I hate her.
24Jr 12:9 Is my heritage to me like a hyena's lair? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.
24Jr 12:10 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; they have trampled down my portion; they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
24Jr 12:11 They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate, but no man lays it to heart.
24Jr 12:12 Upon all the bare heights in the desert destroyers have come, for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land to the other; no flesh has peace.
24Jr 12:13 They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns; they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD."
24Jr 12:14 Thus says the LORD concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage that I have given my people Israel to inherit: "Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
24Jr 12:15 And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land.
24Jr 12:16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
24Jr 12:17 But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, declares the LORD."
24Jr 13:1 Thus says the LORD to me, "Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water."
24Jr 13:2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist.
24Jr 13:3 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,
24Jr 13:4 "Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."
24Jr 13:5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
24Jr 13:6 And after many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."
24Jr 13:7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.
24Jr 13:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 13:9 "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.
24Jr 13:11 For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
24Jr 13:12 "You shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'
24Jr 13:13 Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:14 And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.'"
24Jr 13:15 Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD has spoken.
24Jr 13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.
24Jr 13:17 But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive.
24Jr 13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother: "Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."
24Jr 13:19 The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.
24Jr 13:20 "Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you like those of a woman in labor?
24Jr 13:22 And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up and you suffer violence.
24Jr 13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
24Jr 13:24 I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
24Jr 13:25 This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies.
24Jr 13:26 I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.
24Jr 13:27 I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd whorings, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?"
24Jr 14:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
24Jr 14:2 "Judah mourns, and her gates languish; her people lament on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
24Jr 14:3 Her nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns; they find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads.
24Jr 14:4 Because of the ground that is dismayed, since there is no rain on the land, the farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
24Jr 14:5 Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
24Jr 14:6 The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail because there is no vegetation.
24Jr 14:7 "Though our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for your name's sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:8 O you hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, why should you be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night?
24Jr 14:9 Why should you be like a man confused, like a mighty warrior who cannot save? Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not leave us."
24Jr 14:10 Thus says the LORD concerning this people: "They have loved to wander thus; they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins."
24Jr 14:11 The LORD said to me: "Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
24Jr 14:12 Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."
24Jr 14:13 Then I said: "Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"
24Jr 14:14 And the LORD said to me: "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds.
24Jr 14:15 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, 'Sword and famine shall not come upon this land': By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
24Jr 14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them--them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.
24Jr 14:17 "You shall say to them this word: 'Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound, with a very grievous blow.
24Jr 14:18 If I go out into the field, behold, those pierced by the sword! And if I enter the city, behold, the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land and have no knowledge.'"
24Jr 14:19 Have you utterly rejected Judah? Does your soul loathe Zion? Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
24Jr 14:20 We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:21 Do not spurn us, for your name's sake; do not dishonor your glorious throne; remember and do not break your covenant with us.
24Jr 14:22 Are there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Are you not he, O LORD our God? We set our hope on you, for you do all these things.
24Jr 15:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go!
24Jr 15:2 And when they ask you, 'Where shall we go?' you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: "'Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are for the sword, to the sword; those who are for famine, to famine, and those who are for captivity, to captivity.'
24Jr 15:3 I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
24Jr 15:4 And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
24Jr 15:5 "Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, or who will grieve for you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
24Jr 15:6 You have rejected me, declares the LORD; you keep going backward, so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you-- I am weary of relenting.
24Jr 15:7 I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them; I have destroyed my people; they did not turn from their ways.
24Jr 15:8 I have made their widows more in number than the sand of the seas; I have brought against the mothers of young men a destroyer at noonday; I have made anguish and terror fall upon them suddenly.
24Jr 15:9 She who bore seven has grown feeble; she has fainted away; her sun went down while it was yet day; she has been shamed and disgraced. And the rest of them I will give to the sword before their enemies, declares the LORD."
24Jr 15:10 Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.
24Jr 15:11 The LORD said, "Have I not set you free for their good? Have I not pleaded for you before the enemy in the time of trouble and in the time of distress?
24Jr 15:12 Can one break iron, iron from the north, and bronze?
24Jr 15:13 "Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoil, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory.
24Jr 15:14 I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever."
24Jr 15:15 O LORD, you know; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on my persecutors. In your forbearance take me not away; know that for your sake I bear reproach.
24Jr 15:16 Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.
24Jr 15:17 I did not sit in the company of revelers, nor did I rejoice; I sat alone, because your hand was upon me, for you had filled me with indignation.
24Jr 15:18 Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will you be to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail?
24Jr 15:19 Therefore thus says the LORD: "If you return, I will restore you, and you shall stand before me. If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, you shall be as my mouth. They shall turn to you, but you shall not turn to them.
24Jr 15:20 And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you, declares the LORD.
24Jr 15:21 I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless."
24Jr 16:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 16:2 "You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
24Jr 16:3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
24Jr 16:4 They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
24Jr 16:5 "For thus says the LORD: Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, my steadfast love and mercy, declares the LORD.
24Jr 16:6 Both great and small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or cut himself or make himself bald for them.
24Jr 16:7 No one shall break bread for the mourner, to comfort him for the dead, nor shall anyone give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother.
24Jr 16:8 You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.
24Jr 16:9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will silence in this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
24Jr 16:10 "And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, 'Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?'
24Jr 16:11 then you shall say to them: 'Because your fathers have forsaken me, declares the LORD, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law,
24Jr 16:12 and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn, evil will, refusing to listen to me.
24Jr 16:13 Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.'
24Jr 16:14 "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
24Jr 16:15 but 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.
24Jr 16:16 "Behold, I am sending for many fishers, declares the LORD, and they shall catch them. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
24Jr 16:17 For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
24Jr 16:18 But first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations."
24Jr 16:19 O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in the day of trouble, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and say: "Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, worthless things in which there is no profit.
24Jr 16:20 Can man make for himself gods? Such are not gods!"
24Jr 16:21 "Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the LORD."
24Jr 17:1 "The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars,
24Jr 17:2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim, beside every green tree and on the high hills,
24Jr 17:3 on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory.
24Jr 17:4 You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever."
24Jr 17:5 Thus says the LORD: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD.
24Jr 17:6 He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
24Jr 17:7 "Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.
24Jr 17:8 He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit."
24Jr 17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?
24Jr 17:10 "I the LORD search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds."
24Jr 17:11 Like the partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch, so is he who gets riches but not by justice; in the midst of his days they will leave him, and at his end he will be a fool.
24Jr 17:12 A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
24Jr 17:13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be put to shame; those who turn away from you shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.
24Jr 17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.
24Jr 17:15 Behold, they say to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come!"
24Jr 17:16 I have not run away from being your shepherd, nor have I desired the day of sickness. You know what came out of my lips; it was before your face.
24Jr 17:17 Be not a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
24Jr 17:18 Let those be put to shame who persecute me, but let me not be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed; bring upon them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction!
24Jr 17:19 Thus said the LORD to me: "Go and stand in the People's Gate, by which the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
24Jr 17:20 and say: 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
24Jr 17:21 Thus says the LORD: Take care for the sake of your lives, and do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 17:22 And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.
24Jr 17:23 Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and receive instruction.
24Jr 17:24 "'But if you listen to me, declares the LORD, and bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it,
24Jr 17:25 then there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever.
24Jr 17:26 And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
24Jr 17:27 But if you do not listen to me, to keep the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.'"
24Jr 18:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 18:2 "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words."
24Jr 18:3 So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.
24Jr 18:4 And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
24Jr 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 18:6 "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
24Jr 18:7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,
24Jr 18:8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
24Jr 18:9 And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,
24Jr 18:10 and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
24Jr 18:11 Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 'Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.'
24Jr 18:12 "But they say, 'That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'
24Jr 18:13 "Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations, Who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing.
24Jr 18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion? Do the mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?
24Jr 18:15 But my people have forgotten me; they make offerings to false gods; they made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient roads, and to walk into side roads, not the highway,
24Jr 18:16 making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at forever. Everyone who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head.
24Jr 18:17 Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity."
24Jr 18:18 Then they said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words."
24Jr 18:19 Hear me, O LORD, and listen to the voice of my adversaries.
24Jr 18:20 Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
24Jr 18:21 Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to the power of the sword; let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be struck down by the sword in battle.
24Jr 18:22 May a cry be heard from their houses, when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to take me and laid snares for my feet.
24Jr 18:23 Yet you, O LORD, know all their plotting to kill me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
24Jr 19:1 Thus says the LORD, "Go, buy a potter's earthenware flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests,
24Jr 19:2 and go out to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you.
24Jr 19:3 You shall say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
24Jr 19:4 Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
24Jr 19:5 and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind--
24Jr 19:6 therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24Jr 19:7 And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth.
24Jr 19:8 And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds.
24Jr 19:9 And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.'
24Jr 19:10 "Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you,
24Jr 19:11 and shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended. Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury.
24Jr 19:12 Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth.
24Jr 19:13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah--all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been offered to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods--shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.'"
24Jr 19:14 Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people:
24Jr 19:15 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear my words."
24Jr 20:1 Now Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
24Jr 20:2 Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
24Jr 20:3 The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror On Every Side.
24Jr 20:4 For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
24Jr 20:5 Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
24Jr 20:6 And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely."
24Jr 20:7 O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.
24Jr 20:8 For whenever I speak, I cry out, I shout, "Violence and destruction!" For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.
24Jr 20:9 If I say, "I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name," there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.
24Jr 20:10 For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! "Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" say all my close friends, watching for my fall. "Perhaps he will be deceived; then we can overcome him and take our revenge on him."
24Jr 20:11 But the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble; they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
24Jr 20:12 O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause.
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
24Jr 20:14 Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!
24Jr 20:15 Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, "A son is born to you," making him very glad.
24Jr 20:16 Let that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,
24Jr 20:17 because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb forever great.
24Jr 20:18 Why did I come out from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?
24Jr 21:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,
24Jr 21:2 "Inquire of the LORD for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us."
24Jr 21:3 Then Jeremiah said to them:
24Jr 21:4 "Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls. And I will bring them together into the midst of this city.
24Jr 21:5 I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in fury and in great wrath.
24Jr 21:6 And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
24Jr 21:7 Afterward, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.'
24Jr 21:8 "And to this people you shall say: 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
24Jr 21:9 He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war.
24Jr 21:10 For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.'
24Jr 21:11 "And to the house of the king of Judah say, 'Hear the word of the LORD,
24Jr 21:12 O house of David! Thus says the LORD: "'Execute justice in the morning, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of your evil deeds.'"
24Jr 21:13 "Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, O rock of the plain, declares the LORD; you who say, 'Who shall come down against us, or who shall enter our habitations?'
24Jr 21:14 I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds, declares the LORD; I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is around her."
24Jr 22:1 Thus says the LORD: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,
24Jr 22:2 and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates.
24Jr 22:3 Thus says the LORD: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.
24Jr 22:4 For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants and their people.
24Jr 22:5 But if you will not obey these words, I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
24Jr 22:6 For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: "'You are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, yet surely I will make you a desert, an uninhabited city.
24Jr 22:7 I will prepare destroyers against you, each with his weapons, and they shall cut down your choicest cedars and cast them into the fire.
24Jr 22:8 "'And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, "Why has the LORD dealt thus with this great city?"
24Jr 22:9 And they will answer, "Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them."'"
24Jr 22:10 Weep not for him who is dead, nor grieve for him, but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land.
24Jr 22:11 For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went away from this place: "He shall return here no more,
24Jr 22:12 but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again."
24Jr 22:13 "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice, who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing and does not give him his wages,
24Jr 22:14 who says, 'I will build myself a great house with spacious upper rooms,' who cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar and painting it with vermilion.
24Jr 22:15 Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
24Jr 22:16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know me? declares the LORD.
24Jr 22:17 But you have eyes and heart only for your dishonest gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for practicing oppression and violence."
24Jr 22:18 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: "They shall not lament for him, saying, 'Ah, my brother!' or 'Ah, sister!' They shall not lament for him, saying, 'Ah, lord!' or 'Ah, his majesty!'
24Jr 22:19 With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried, dragged and dumped beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
24Jr 22:20 "Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed.
24Jr 22:21 I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your way from your youth, that you have not obeyed my voice.
24Jr 22:22 The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; then you will be ashamed and confounded because of all your evil.
24Jr 22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in labor!"
24Jr 22:24 "As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off
24Jr 22:25 and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 22:26 I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die.
24Jr 22:27 But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return."
24Jr 22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land that they do not know?
24Jr 22:29 O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!
24Jr 22:30 Thus says the LORD: "Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah."
24Jr 23:1 "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!" declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:2 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: "You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:3 Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
24Jr 23:4 I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:5 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 23:6 In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.'
24Jr 23:7 "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
24Jr 23:8 but 'As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' Then they shall dwell in their own land."
24Jr 23:9 Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words.
24Jr 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right.
24Jr 23:11 "Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their evil, declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:12 Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall, for I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:13 In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24Jr 23:14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his evil; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah."
24Jr 23:15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: "Behold, I will feed them with bitter food and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land."
24Jr 23:16 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
24Jr 23:17 They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, 'It shall be well with you'; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, 'No disaster shall come upon you.'"
24Jr 23:18 For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and to hear his word, or who has paid attention to his word and listened?
24Jr 23:19 Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
24Jr 23:20 The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
24Jr 23:21 "I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
24Jr 23:22 But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds.
24Jr 23:23 "Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away?
24Jr 23:24 Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:25 I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, 'I have dreamed, I have dreamed!'
24Jr 23:26 How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
24Jr 23:27 who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal?
24Jr 23:28 Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:29 Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
24Jr 23:30 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another.
24Jr 23:31 Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, 'declares the LORD.'
24Jr 23:32 Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD.
24Jr 23:33 "When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, 'What is the burden of the LORD?' you shall say to them, 'You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD.'
24Jr 23:34 And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, 'The burden of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household.
24Jr 23:35 Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, 'What has the LORD answered?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24Jr 23:36 But 'the burden of the LORD' you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
24Jr 23:37 Thus you shall say to the prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24Jr 23:38 But if you say, 'The burden of the LORD,' thus says the LORD, 'Because you have said these words, "The burden of the LORD," when I sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, 'The burden of the LORD,'"
24Jr 23:39 therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.
24Jr 23:40 And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.'"
24Jr 24:1 After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me this vision: behold, two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 24:2 One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
24Jr 24:3 And the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."
24Jr 24:4 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 24:5 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 24:6 I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not uproot them.
24Jr 24:7 I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
24Jr 24:8 "But thus says the LORD: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 24:9 I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a reproach, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.
24Jr 24:10 And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers."
24Jr 25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
24Jr 25:2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
24Jr 25:3 "For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened.
24Jr 25:4 You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,
24Jr 25:5 saying, 'Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever.
24Jr 25:6 Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.'
24Jr 25:7 Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.
24Jr 25:8 "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
24Jr 25:9 behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
24Jr 25:10 Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
24Jr 25:11 This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
24Jr 25:12 Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste.
24Jr 25:13 I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
24Jr 25:14 For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands."
24Jr 25:15 Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24Jr 25:16 They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among them."
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
24Jr 25:18 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;
24Jr 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all his people,
24Jr 25:20 and all the mixed tribes among them; all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);
24Jr 25:21 Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;
24Jr 25:22 all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea;
24Jr 25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;
24Jr 25:24 all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
24Jr 25:25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
24Jr 25:26 all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Babylon shall drink.
24Jr 25:27 "Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword that I am sending among you.'
24Jr 25:28 "And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: You must drink!
24Jr 25:29 For behold, I begin to work disaster at the city that is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.'
24Jr 25:30 "You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: "'The LORD will roar from on high, and from his holy habitation utter his voice; he will roar mightily against his fold, and shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24Jr 25:31 The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD has an indictment against the nations; he is entering into judgment with all flesh, and the wicked he will put to the sword, declares the LORD.'
24Jr 25:32 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, disaster is going forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth!
24Jr 25:33 "And those pierced by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 25:34 "Wail, you shepherds, and cry out, and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come, and you shall fall like a choice vessel.
24Jr 25:35 No refuge will remain for the shepherds, nor escape for the lords of the flock.
24Jr 25:36 A voice--the cry of the shepherds, and the wail of the lords of the flock! For the LORD is laying waste their pasture,
24Jr 25:37 and the peaceful folds are devastated because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
24Jr 25:38 Like a lion he has left his lair, for their land has become a waste because of the sword of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger."
24Jr 26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
24Jr 26:2 "Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word.
24Jr 26:3 It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil deeds.
24Jr 26:4 You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,
24Jr 26:5 and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not listened,
24Jr 26:6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.'"
24Jr 26:7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:8 And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, "You shall die!
24Jr 26:9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:10 When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:11 Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
24Jr 26:12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
24Jr 26:13 Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you.
24Jr 26:14 But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
24Jr 26:15 Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."
24Jr 26:16 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
24Jr 26:17 And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,
24Jr 26:18 "Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "'Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'
24Jr 26:19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves."
24Jr 26:20 There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.
24Jr 26:21 And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
24Jr 26:22 Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him,
24Jr 26:23 and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
24Jr 26:24 But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.
24Jr 27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
24Jr 27:2 Thus the LORD said to me: "Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck.
24Jr 27:3 Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
24Jr 27:4 Give them this charge for their masters: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:
24Jr 27:5 "It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.
24Jr 27:6 Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.
24Jr 27:7 All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
24Jr 27:8 "'"But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand.
24Jr 27:9 So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'
24Jr 27:10 For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish.
24Jr 27:11 But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD."'"
24Jr 27:12 To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live.
24Jr 27:13 Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
24Jr 27:14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
24Jr 27:15 I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you."
24Jr 27:16 Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
24Jr 27:17 Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
24Jr 27:18 If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
24Jr 27:19 For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
24Jr 27:20 which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--
24Jr 27:21 thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
24Jr 27:22 They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place."
24Jr 28:1 In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
24Jr 28:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 28:3 Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
24Jr 28:4 I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the LORD, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
24Jr 28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,
24Jr 28:6 and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles.
24Jr 28:7 Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
24Jr 28:8 The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms.
24Jr 28:9 As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet."
24Jr 28:10 Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.
24Jr 28:11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years." But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
24Jr 28:12 Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 28:13 "Go, tell Hananiah, 'Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron.
24Jr 28:14 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.'"
24Jr 28:15 And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.
24Jr 28:16 Therefore thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the LORD.'"
24Jr 28:17 In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
24Jr 29:1 These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders of the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24Jr 29:2 This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
24Jr 29:3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
24Jr 29:4 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24Jr 29:5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
24Jr 29:6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
24Jr 29:7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
24Jr 29:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream,
24Jr 29:9 for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, declares the LORD.
24Jr 29:10 "For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place.
24Jr 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.
24Jr 29:12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you.
24Jr 29:13 You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.
24Jr 29:14 I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
24Jr 29:15 "Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'
24Jr 29:16 thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:
24Jr 29:17 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.
24Jr 29:18 I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
24Jr 29:19 because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.'
24Jr 29:20 Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24Jr 29:21 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.
24Jr 29:22 Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
24Jr 29:23 because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, declares the LORD.'"
24Jr 29:24 To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
24Jr 29:25 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
24Jr 29:26 'The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons.
24Jr 29:27 Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
24Jr 29:28 For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce."'"
24Jr 29:29 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
24Jr 29:30 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 29:31 "Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,
24Jr 29:32 therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.'"
24Jr 30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 30:2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
24Jr 30:3 For behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the LORD, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it."
24Jr 30:4 These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
24Jr 30:5 "Thus says the LORD: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace.
24Jr 30:6 Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?
24Jr 30:7 Alas! That day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.
24Jr 30:8 "And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him.
24Jr 30:9 But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24Jr 30:10 "Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.
24Jr 30:11 For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
24Jr 30:12 "For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is grievous.
24Jr 30:13 There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you.
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant.
24Jr 30:15 Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you.
24Jr 30:16 Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.
24Jr 30:17 For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the LORD, because they have called you an outcast: 'It is Zion, for whom no one cares!'
24Jr 30:18 "Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be.
24Jr 30:19 Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, and the voices of those who celebrate. I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.
24Jr 30:20 Their children shall be as they were of old, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all who oppress them.
24Jr 30:21 Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst; I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me? declares the LORD.
24Jr 30:22 And you shall be my people, and I will be your God."
24Jr 30:23 Behold the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
24Jr 30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intentions of his mind. In the latter days you will understand this.
24Jr 31:1 "At that time, declares the LORD, I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they shall be my people."
24Jr 31:2 Thus says the LORD: "The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; when Israel sought for rest,
24Jr 31:3 the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
24Jr 31:4 Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel! Again you shall adorn yourself with tambourines and shall go forth in the dance of the merrymakers.
24Jr 31:5 Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant and shall enjoy the fruit.
24Jr 31:6 For there shall be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim: 'Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'"
24Jr 31:7 For thus says the LORD: "Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, 'O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.'
24Jr 31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.
24Jr 31:9 With weeping they shall come, and with pleas for mercy I will lead them back, I will make them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
24Jr 31:10 "Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; say, 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.'
24Jr 31:11 For the LORD has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
24Jr 31:12 They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD, over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; their life shall be like a watered garden, and they shall languish no more.
24Jr 31:13 Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry. I will turn their mourning into joy; I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.
24Jr 31:14 I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, declares the LORD."
24Jr 31:15 Thus says the LORD: "A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more."
24Jr 31:16 Thus says the LORD: "Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the LORD, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.
24Jr 31:17 There is hope for your future, declares the LORD, and your children shall come back to their own country.
24Jr 31:18 I have heard Ephraim grieving, 'You have disciplined me, and I was disciplined, like an untrained calf; bring me back that I may be restored, for you are the LORD my God.
24Jr 31:19 For after I had turned away, I relented, and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh; I was ashamed, and I was confounded, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'
24Jr 31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, declares the LORD.
24Jr 31:21 "Set up road markers for yourself; make yourself guideposts; consider well the highway, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin Israel, return to these your cities.
24Jr 31:22 How long will you waver, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing on the earth: a woman encircles a man."
24Jr 31:23 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their fortunes: "'The LORD bless you, O habitation of righteousness, O holy hill!'
24Jr 31:24 And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and the farmers and those who wander with their flocks.
24Jr 31:25 For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish."
24Jr 31:26 At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
24Jr 31:27 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
24Jr 31:28 And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, declares the LORD.
24Jr 31:29 In those days they shall no longer say: "'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
24Jr 31:30 But everyone shall die for his own sin. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
24Jr 31:31 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
24Jr 31:32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.
24Jr 31:33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
24Jr 31:34 And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
24Jr 31:35 Thus says the LORD, who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- the LORD of hosts is his name:
24Jr 31:36 "If this fixed order departs from before me, declares the LORD, then shall the offspring of Israel cease from being a nation before me forever."
24Jr 31:37 Thus says the LORD: "If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, declares the LORD."
24Jr 31:38 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24Jr 31:39 And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah.
24Jr 31:40 The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be sacred to the LORD. It shall not be uprooted or overthrown anymore forever."
24Jr 32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 32:2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah.
24Jr 32:3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;
24Jr 32:4 Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
24Jr 32:5 And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed'?"
24Jr 32:6 Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 32:7 Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.'
24Jr 32:8 Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
24Jr 32:9 "And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
24Jr 32:10 I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.
24Jr 32:11 Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy.
24Jr 32:12 And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard.
24Jr 32:13 I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,
24Jr 32:14 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.
24Jr 32:15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.'
24Jr 32:16 "After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
24Jr 32:17 'Ah, Lord GOD! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.
24Jr 32:18 You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
24Jr 32:19 great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
24Jr 32:20 You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day.
24Jr 32:21 You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror.
24Jr 32:22 And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
24Jr 32:23 And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them.
24Jr 32:24 Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it.
24Jr 32:25 Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"--though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.'"
24Jr 32:26 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 32:27 "Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me?
24Jr 32:28 Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
24Jr 32:29 The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
24Jr 32:30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
24Jr 32:31 This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight
24Jr 32:32 because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger--their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 32:33 They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction.
24Jr 32:34 They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
24Jr 32:35 They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
24Jr 32:36 "Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence':
24Jr 32:37 Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety.
24Jr 32:38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
24Jr 32:39 I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their own good and the good of their children after them.
24Jr 32:40 I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.
24Jr 32:41 I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
24Jr 32:42 "For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.
24Jr 32:43 Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, 'It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'
24Jr 32:44 Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD."
24Jr 33:1 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard:
24Jr 33:2 "Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it--the LORD is his name:
24Jr 33:3 Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.
24Jr 33:4 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and against the sword:
24Jr 33:5 They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil.
24Jr 33:6 Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.
24Jr 33:7 I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first.
24Jr 33:8 I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.
24Jr 33:9 And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.
24Jr 33:10 "Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, 'It is a waste without man or beast,' in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again
24Jr 33:11 the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD: "'Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!' For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:12 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place that is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks.
24Jr 33:13 In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:14 "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24Jr 33:15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 33:16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.'
24Jr 33:17 "For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
24Jr 33:18 and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever."
24Jr 33:19 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:20 "Thus says the LORD: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,
24Jr 33:21 then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers.
24Jr 33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me."
24Jr 33:23 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:24 "Have you not observed that these people are saying, 'The LORD has rejected the two clans that he chose'? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.
24Jr 33:25 Thus says the LORD: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth,
24Jr 33:26 then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them."
24Jr 34:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
24Jr 34:2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
24Jr 34:3 You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.'
24Jr 34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: 'You shall not die by the sword.
24Jr 34:5 You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD."
24Jr 34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
24Jr 34:7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
24Jr 34:8 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
24Jr 34:9 that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
24Jr 34:10 And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
24Jr 34:11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
24Jr 34:12 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 34:13 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
24Jr 34:14 'At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.' But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
24Jr 34:15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name,
24Jr 34:16 but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
24Jr 34:17 "Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24Jr 34:18 And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts--
24Jr 34:19 the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
24Jr 34:20 And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
24Jr 34:21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.
24Jr 34:22 Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant."
24Jr 35:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
24Jr 35:2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink."
24Jr 35:3 So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.
24Jr 35:4 I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.
24Jr 35:5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine."
24Jr 35:6 But they answered, "We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, 'You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
24Jr 35:7 You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.'
24Jr 35:8 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
24Jr 35:9 and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,
24Jr 35:10 but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
24Jr 35:11 But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.' So we are living in Jerusalem."
24Jr 35:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 35:13 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD.
24Jr 35:14 The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me.
24Jr 35:15 I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, 'Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
24Jr 35:16 The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
24Jr 35:17 Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered."
24Jr 35:18 But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,
24Jr 35:19 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."
24Jr 36:1 In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 36:2 "Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
24Jr 36:3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
24Jr 36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
24Jr 36:5 And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, "I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,
24Jr 36:6 so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
24Jr 36:7 It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
24Jr 36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
24Jr 36:9 In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
24Jr 36:10 Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
24Jr 36:11 When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
24Jr 36:12 he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
24Jr 36:13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
24Jr 36:14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
24Jr 36:15 And they said to him, "Sit down and read it." So Baruch read it to them.
24Jr 36:16 When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."
24Jr 36:17 Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
24Jr 36:18 Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll."
24Jr 36:19 Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."
24Jr 36:20 So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
24Jr 36:21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
24Jr 36:22 It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
24Jr 36:23 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
24Jr 36:24 Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
24Jr 36:25 Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24Jr 36:26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
24Jr 36:27 Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 36:28 "Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
24Jr 36:29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"
24Jr 36:30 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
24Jr 36:31 And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"
24Jr 36:32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
24Jr 37:1 Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
24Jr 37:2 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
24Jr 37:3 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Please pray for us to the LORD our God."
24Jr 37:4 Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
24Jr 37:5 The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
24Jr 37:6 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
24Jr 37:7 "Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, 'Behold, Pharaoh's army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land.
24Jr 37:8 And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall capture it and burn it with fire.
24Jr 37:9 Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go away.
24Jr 37:10 For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"
24Jr 37:11 Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,
24Jr 37:12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
24Jr 37:13 When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
24Jr 37:14 And Jeremiah said, "It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24Jr 37:15 And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
24Jr 37:16 When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,
24Jr 37:17 King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."
24Jr 37:18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
24Jr 37:19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?
24Jr 37:20 Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there."
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
24Jr 38:1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
24Jr 38:2 "Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
24Jr 38:3 Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken."
24Jr 38:4 Then the officials said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you."
24Jr 38:6 So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
24Jr 38:7 When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern--the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate--
24Jr 38:8 Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,
24Jr 38:9 "My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."
24Jr 38:10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, "Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
24Jr 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.
24Jr 38:12 Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.
24Jr 38:13 Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
24Jr 38:14 King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."
24Jr 38:15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."
24Jr 38:16 Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life."
24Jr 38:17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
24Jr 38:18 But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."
24Jr 38:19 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me."
24Jr 38:20 Jeremiah said, "You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
24Jr 38:21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:
24Jr 38:22 Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, "'Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mud, they turn away from you.'
24Jr 38:23 All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire."
24Jr 38:24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.
24Jr 38:25 If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'
24Jr 38:26 then you shall say to them, 'I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
24Jr 38:27 Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
24Jr 38:28 And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
24Jr 39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.
24Jr 39:2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
24Jr 39:3 Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 39:4 When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah.
24Jr 39:5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him.
24Jr 39:6 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
24Jr 39:7 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
24Jr 39:8 The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24Jr 39:9 Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
24Jr 39:10 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
24Jr 39:11 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
24Jr 39:12 "Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you."
24Jr 39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
24Jr 39:14 sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he lived among the people.
24Jr 39:15 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
24Jr 39:16 "Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day.
24Jr 39:17 But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
24Jr 39:18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.'"
24Jr 40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
24Jr 40:2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place.
24Jr 40:3 The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.
24Jr 40:4 Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.
24Jr 40:5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go." So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.
24Jr 40:6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
24Jr 40:7 When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,
24Jr 40:8 they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
24Jr 40:9 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
24Jr 40:10 As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken."
24Jr 40:11 Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
24Jr 40:12 then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
24Jr 40:13 Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24Jr 40:14 and said to him, "Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.
24Jr 40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, "Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?"
24Jr 40:16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael."
24Jr 41:1 In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,
24Jr 41:2 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
24Jr 41:4 On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
24Jr 41:5 eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 41:6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, "Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
24Jr 41:7 When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
24Jr 41:8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields." So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.
24Jr 41:9 Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
24Jr 41:10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
24Jr 41:12 they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
24Jr 41:13 And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
24Jr 41:14 So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
24Jr 41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam--soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon.
24Jr 41:17 And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
24Jr 41:18 because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
24Jr 42:1 Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, came near
24Jr 42:2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Let our plea for mercy come before you, and pray to the LORD your God for us, for all this remnant--because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us--
24Jr 42:3 that the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do."
24Jr 42:4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you."
24Jr 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us.
24Jr 42:6 Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."
24Jr 42:7 At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
24Jr 42:8 Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
24Jr 42:9 and said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:
24Jr 42:10 If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I relent of the disaster that I did to you.
24Jr 42:11 Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him, declares the LORD, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
24Jr 42:12 I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land.
24Jr 42:13 But if you say, 'We will not remain in this land,' disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
24Jr 42:14 and saying, 'No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,'
24Jr 42:15 then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there,
24Jr 42:16 then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, and there you shall die.
24Jr 42:17 All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.
24Jr 42:18 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more.
24Jr 42:19 The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day
24Jr 42:20 that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says declare to us and we will do it.'
24Jr 42:21 And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you.
24Jr 42:22 Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live."
24Jr 43:1 When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the LORD their God, with which the LORD their God had sent him to them,
24Jr 43:2 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie. The LORD our God did not send you to say, 'Do not go to Egypt to live there,'
24Jr 43:3 but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon."
24Jr 43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah.
24Jr 43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven--
24Jr 43:6 the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah.
24Jr 43:7 And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they arrived at Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
24Jr 43:9 "Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
24Jr 43:10 and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his royal canopy over them.
24Jr 43:11 He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword.
24Jr 43:12 I shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in peace.
24Jr 43:13 He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.'"
24Jr 44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros,
24Jr 44:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them,
24Jr 44:3 because of the evil that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
24Jr 44:4 Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, 'Oh, do not do this abomination that I hate!'
24Jr 44:5 But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods.
24Jr 44:6 Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day.
24Jr 44:7 And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant?
24Jr 44:8 Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth?
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, the evil of the kings of Judah, the evil of their wives, your own evil, and the evil of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 44:10 They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers.
24Jr 44:11 "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for harm, to cut off all Judah.
24Jr 44:12 I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed. In the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be consumed. From the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine, and they shall become an oath, a horror, a curse, and a taunt.
24Jr 44:13 I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
24Jr 44:14 so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except some fugitives."
24Jr 44:15 Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
24Jr 44:16 "As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
24Jr 44:17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster.
24Jr 44:18 But since we left off making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine."
24Jr 44:19 And the women said, "When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands' approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?"
24Jr 44:20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer:
24Jr 44:21 "As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind?
24Jr 44:22 The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
24Jr 44:23 It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day."
24Jr 44:24 Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 44:25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, 'We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.' Then confirm your vows and perform your vows!
24Jr 44:26 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, 'As the Lord GOD lives.'
24Jr 44:27 Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them.
24Jr 44:28 And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
24Jr 44:29 This shall be the sign to you, declares the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, in order that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for harm:
24Jr 44:30 Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life."
24Jr 45:1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
24Jr 45:2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
24Jr 45:3 You said, 'Woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.'
24Jr 45:4 Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD: Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up--that is, the whole land.
24Jr 45:5 And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the LORD. But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go."
24Jr 46:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
24Jr 46:2 About Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
24Jr 46:3 "Prepare buckler and shield, and advance for battle!
24Jr 46:4 Harness the horses; mount, O horsemen! Take your stations with your helmets, polish your spears, put on your armor!
24Jr 46:5 Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and have turned backward. Their warriors are beaten down and have fled in haste; they look not back-- terror on every side! declares the LORD.
24Jr 46:6 "The swift cannot flee away, nor the warrior escape; in the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.
24Jr 46:7 "Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge?
24Jr 46:8 Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge. He said, 'I will rise, I will cover the earth, I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.'
24Jr 46:9 Advance, O horses, and rage, O chariots! Let the warriors go out: men of Cush and Put who handle the shield, men of Lud, skilled in handling the bow.
24Jr 46:10 That day is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, to avenge himself on his foes. The sword shall devour and be sated and drink its fill of their blood. For the Lord GOD of hosts holds a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
24Jr 46:11 Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you.
24Jr 46:12 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for warrior has stumbled against warrior; they have both fallen together."
24Jr 46:13 The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
24Jr 46:14 "Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol; proclaim in Memphis and Tahpanhes; say, 'Stand ready and be prepared, for the sword shall devour around you.'
24Jr 46:15 Why are your mighty ones face down? They do not stand because the LORD thrust them down.
24Jr 46:16 He made many stumble, and they fell, and they said one to another, 'Arise, and let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, because of the sword of the oppressor.'
24Jr 46:17 Call the name of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, 'Noisy one who lets the hour go by.'
24Jr 46:18 "As I live, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, shall one come.
24Jr 46:19 Prepare yourselves baggage for exile, O inhabitants of Egypt! For Memphis shall become a waste, a ruin, without inhabitant.
24Jr 46:20 "A beautiful heifer is Egypt, but a biting fly from the north has come upon her.
24Jr 46:21 Even her hired soldiers in her midst are like fattened calves; yes, they have turned and fled together; they did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 46:22 "She makes a sound like a serpent gliding away; for her enemies march in force and come against her with axes like those who fell trees.
24Jr 46:23 They shall cut down her forest, declares the LORD, though it is impenetrable, because they are more numerous than locusts; they are without number.
24Jr 46:24 The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of a people from the north."
24Jr 46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said: "Behold, I am bringing punishment upon Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh and Egypt and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
24Jr 46:26 I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their life, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in the days of old, declares the LORD.
24Jr 46:27 "But fear not, O Jacob my servant, nor be dismayed, O Israel, for behold, I will save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.
24Jr 46:28 Fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, for I am with you. I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have driven you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished."
24Jr 47:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck down Gaza.
24Jr 47:2 "Thus says the LORD: Behold, waters are rising out of the north, and shall become an overflowing torrent; they shall overflow the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it. Men shall cry out, and every inhabitant of the land shall wail.
24Jr 47:3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of their wheels, the fathers look not back to their children, so feeble are their hands,
24Jr 47:4 because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remains. For the LORD is destroying the Philistines, the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
24Jr 47:5 Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has perished. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourselves?
24Jr 47:6 Ah, sword of the LORD! How long till you are quiet? Put yourself into your scabbard; rest and be still!
24Jr 47:7 How can it be quiet when the LORD has given it a charge? Against Ashkelon and against the seashore he has appointed it."
24Jr 48:1 Concerning Moab. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; the fortress is put to shame and broken down;
24Jr 48:2 the renown of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they planned disaster against her: 'Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!' You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.
24Jr 48:3 "A voice! A cry from Horonaim, 'Desolation and great destruction!'
24Jr 48:4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have made a cry.
24Jr 48:5 For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distressed cry of destruction.
24Jr 48:6 Flee! Save yourselves! You will be like a juniper in the desert!
24Jr 48:7 For, because you trusted in your works and your treasures, you also shall be taken; and Chemosh shall go into exile with his priests and his officials.
24Jr 48:8 The destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.
24Jr 48:9 "Give wings to Moab, for she would fly away; her cities shall become a desolation, with no inhabitant in them.
24Jr 48:10 "Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD with slackness, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed.
24Jr 48:11 "Moab has been at ease from his youth and has settled on his dregs; he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into exile; so his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
24Jr 48:12 "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I shall send to him pourers who will pour him, and empty his vessels and break his jars in pieces.
24Jr 48:13 Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
24Jr 48:14 "How do you say, 'We are heroes and mighty men of war'?
24Jr 48:15 The destroyer of Moab and his cities has come up, and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 48:16 The calamity of Moab is near at hand, and his affliction hastens swiftly.
24Jr 48:17 Grieve for him, all you who are around him, and all who know his name; say, 'How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff.'
24Jr 48:18 "Come down from your glory, and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitant of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; he has destroyed your strongholds.
24Jr 48:19 Stand by the way and watch, O inhabitant of Aroer! Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, 'What has happened?'
24Jr 48:20 Moab is put to shame, for it is broken; wail and cry! Tell it beside the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
24Jr 48:21 "Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mephaath,
24Jr 48:22 and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
24Jr 48:23 and Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,
24Jr 48:24 and Kerioth, and Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.
24Jr 48:25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, declares the LORD.
24Jr 48:26 "Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the LORD, so that Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he too shall be held in derision.
24Jr 48:27 Was not Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves, that whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head?
24Jr 48:28 "Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like the dove that nests in the sides of the mouth of a gorge.
24Jr 48:29 We have heard of the pride of Moab-- he is very proud-- of his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
24Jr 48:30 I know his insolence, declares the LORD; his boasts are false, his deeds are false.
24Jr 48:31 Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for all Moab; for the men of Kir-hareseth I mourn.
24Jr 48:32 More than for Jazer I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed over the sea, reached to the Sea of Jazer; on your summer fruits and your grapes the destroyer has fallen.
24Jr 48:33 Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of Moab; I have made the wine cease from the winepresses; no one treads them with shouts of joy; the shouting is not the shout of joy.
24Jr 48:34 "From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. For the waters of Nimrim also have become desolate.
24Jr 48:35 And I will bring to an end in Moab, declares the LORD, him who offers sacrifice in the high place and makes offerings to his god.
24Jr 48:36 Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the men of Kir-hareseth. Therefore the riches they gained have perished.
24Jr 48:37 "For every head is shaved and every beard cut off. On all the hands are gashes, and around the waist is sackcloth.
24Jr 48:38 On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation, for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one cares, declares the LORD.
24Jr 48:39 How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are around him."
24Jr 48:40 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against Moab;
24Jr 48:41 the cities shall be taken and the strongholds seized. The heart of the warriors of Moab shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her birth pains;
24Jr 48:42 Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people, because he magnified himself against the LORD.
24Jr 48:43 Terror, pit, and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab! declares the LORD.
24Jr 48:44 He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab, the year of their punishment, declares the LORD.
24Jr 48:45 "In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop without strength, for fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the house of Sihon; it has destroyed the forehead of Moab, the crown of the sons of tumult.
24Jr 48:46 Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are undone, for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.
24Jr 48:47 Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, declares the LORD." Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
24Jr 49:1 Concerning the Ammonites. Thus says the LORD: "Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad, and his people settled in its cities?
24Jr 49:2 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will cause the battle cry to be heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it shall become a desolate mound, and its villages shall be burned with fire; then Israel shall dispossess those who dispossessed him, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:3 "Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste! Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth, lament, and run to and fro among the hedges! For Milcom shall go into exile, with his priests and his officials.
24Jr 49:4 Why do you boast of your valleys, O faithless daughter, who trusted in her treasures, saying, 'Who will come against me?'
24Jr 49:5 Behold, I will bring terror upon you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts, from all who are around you, and you shall be driven out, every man straight before him, with none to gather the fugitives.
24Jr 49:6 "But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites, declares the LORD."
24Jr 49:7 Concerning Edom. Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?
24Jr 49:8 Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan! For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time when I punish him.
24Jr 49:9 If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves came by night, would they not destroy only enough for themselves?
24Jr 49:10 But I have stripped Esau bare; I have uncovered his hiding places, and he is not able to conceal himself. His children are destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.
24Jr 49:11 Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive; and let your widows trust in me."
24Jr 49:12 For thus says the LORD: "If those who did not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, will you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you must drink.
24Jr 49:13 For I have sworn by myself, declares the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a horror, a taunt, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes."
24Jr 49:14 I have heard a message from the LORD, and an envoy has been sent among the nations: "Gather yourselves together and come against her, and rise up for battle!
24Jr 49:15 For behold, I will make you small among the nations, despised among mankind.
24Jr 49:16 The horror you inspire has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, you who live in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as the eagle's, I will bring you down from there, declares the LORD.
24Jr 49:17 "Edom shall become a horror. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters.
24Jr 49:18 As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities were overthrown, says the LORD, no man shall dwell there, no man shall sojourn in her.
24Jr 49:19 Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make him run away from her. And I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me?
24Jr 49:20 Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away. Surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
24Jr 49:21 At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble; the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea.
24Jr 49:22 Behold, one shall mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah, and the heart of the warriors of Edom shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her birth pains."
24Jr 49:23 Concerning Damascus: "Hamath and Arpad are confounded, for they have heard bad news; they melt in fear, they are troubled like the sea that cannot be quiet.
24Jr 49:24 Damascus has become feeble, she turned to flee, and panic seized her; anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:25 How is the famous city not forsaken, the city of my joy?
24Jr 49:26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day, declares the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad."
24Jr 49:28 Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck down. Thus says the LORD: "Rise up, advance against Kedar! Destroy the people of the east!
24Jr 49:29 Their tents and their flocks shall be taken, their curtains and all their goods; their camels shall be led away from them, and men shall cry to them: 'Terror on every side!'
24Jr 49:30 Flee, wander far away, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Hazor! declares the LORD. For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has made a plan against you and formed a purpose against you.
24Jr 49:31 "Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, that dwells securely, declares the LORD, that has no gates or bars, that dwells alone.
24Jr 49:32 Their camels shall become plunder, their herds of livestock a spoil. I will scatter to every wind those who cut the corners of their hair, and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, declares the LORD.
24Jr 49:33 Hazor shall become a haunt of jackals, an everlasting waste; no man shall dwell there; no man shall sojourn in her."
24Jr 49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
24Jr 49:35 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might.
24Jr 49:36 And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven. And I will scatter them to all those winds, and there shall be no nation to which those driven out of Elam shall not come.
24Jr 49:37 I will terrify Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their life. I will bring disaster upon them, my fierce anger, declares the LORD. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them,
24Jr 49:38 and I will set my throne in Elam and destroy their king and officials, declares the LORD.
24Jr 49:39 "But in the latter days I will restore the fortunes of Elam, declares the LORD."
24Jr 50:1 The word that the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet:
24Jr 50:2 "Declare among the nations and proclaim, set up a banner and proclaim, conceal it not, and say: 'Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed. Her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.'
24Jr 50:3 "For out of the north a nation has come up against her, which shall make her land a desolation, and none shall dwell in it; both man and beast shall flee away.
24Jr 50:4 "In those days and in that time, declares the LORD, the people of Israel and the people of Judah shall come together, weeping as they come, and they shall seek the LORD their God.
24Jr 50:5 They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, saying, 'Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.'
24Jr 50:6 "My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the mountains. From mountain to hill they have gone. They have forgotten their fold.
24Jr 50:7 All who found them have devoured them, and their enemies have said, 'We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the LORD, their habitation of righteousness, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.'
24Jr 50:8 "Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as male goats before the flock.
24Jr 50:9 For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a gathering of great nations, from the north country. And they shall array themselves against her. From there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
24Jr 50:10 Chaldea shall be plundered; all who plunder her shall be sated, declares the LORD.
24Jr 50:11 "Though you rejoice, though you exult, O plunderers of my heritage, though you frolic like a heifer in the pasture, and neigh like stallions,
24Jr 50:12 your mother shall be utterly shamed, and she who bore you shall be disgraced. Behold, she shall be the last of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
24Jr 50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD she shall not be inhabited but shall be an utter desolation; everyone who passes by Babylon shall be appalled, and hiss because of all her wounds.
24Jr 50:14 Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 50:15 Raise a shout against her all around; she has surrendered; her bulwarks have fallen; her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done.
24Jr 50:16 Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the one who handles the sickle in time of harvest; because of the sword of the oppressor, every one shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
24Jr 50:17 "Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.
24Jr 50:18 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing punishment on the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.
24Jr 50:19 I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and his desire shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
24Jr 50:20 In those days and in that time, declares the LORD, iniquity shall be sought in Israel, and there shall be none, and sin in Judah, and none shall be found, for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.
24Jr 50:21 "Go up against the land of Merathaim, and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Kill, and devote them to destruction, declares the LORD, and do all that I have commanded you.
24Jr 50:22 The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction!
24Jr 50:23 How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
24Jr 50:24 I set a snare for you and you were taken, O Babylon, and you did not know it; you were found and caught, because you opposed the LORD.
24Jr 50:25 The LORD has opened his armory and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 50:26 Come against her from every quarter; open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain, and devote her to destruction; let nothing be left of her.
24Jr 50:27 Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 50:28 "A voice! They flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 50:29 "Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her according to all that she has done. For she has proudly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 50:30 Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, declares the LORD.
24Jr 50:31 "Behold, I am against you, O proud one, declares the Lord GOD of hosts, for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
24Jr 50:32 The proud one shall stumble and fall, with none to raise him up, and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all that is around him.
24Jr 50:33 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah with them. All who took them captive have held them fast; they refuse to let them go.
24Jr 50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will surely plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 50:35 "A sword against the Chaldeans, declares the LORD, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her officials and her wise men!
24Jr 50:36 A sword against the diviners, that they may become fools! A sword against her warriors, that they may be destroyed!
24Jr 50:37 A sword against her horses and against her chariots, and against all the foreign troops in her midst, that they may become women! A sword against all her treasures, that they may be plundered!
24Jr 50:38 A drought against her waters, that they may be dried up! For it is a land of images, and they are mad over idols.
24Jr 50:39 "Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall dwell in her. She shall never again have people, nor be inhabited for all generations.
24Jr 50:40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, declares the LORD, so no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn in her.
24Jr 50:41 "Behold, a people comes from the north; a mighty nation and many kings are stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
24Jr 50:42 They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy. The sound of them is like the roaring of the sea; they ride on horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon!
24Jr 50:43 "The king of Babylon heard the report of them, and his hands fell helpless; anguish seized him, pain as of a woman in labor.
24Jr 50:44 "Behold, like a lion coming up from the thicket of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make them run away from her, and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me?
24Jr 50:45 Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Babylon, and the purposes that he has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the little ones of their flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
24Jr 50:46 At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations."
24Jr 51:1 Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon, against the inhabitants of Leb-kamai,
24Jr 51:2 and I will send to Babylon winnowers, and they shall winnow her, and they shall empty her land, when they come against her from every side on the day of trouble.
24Jr 51:3 Let not the archer bend his bow, and let him not stand up in his armor. Spare not her young men; devote to destruction all her army.
24Jr 51:4 They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and wounded in her streets.
24Jr 51:5 For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD of hosts, but the land of the Chaldeans is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 51:6 "Flee from the midst of Babylon; let every one save his life! Be not cut off in her punishment, for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance, the repayment he is rendering her.
24Jr 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad.
24Jr 51:8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.
24Jr 51:9 We would have healed Babylon, but she was not healed. Forsake her, and let us go each to his own country, for her judgment has reached up to heaven and has been lifted up even to the skies.
24Jr 51:10 The LORD has brought about our vindication; come, let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
24Jr 51:11 "Sharpen the arrows! Take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 51:12 "Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; set up watchmen; prepare the ambushes; for the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 51:13 O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come; the thread of your life is cut.
24Jr 51:14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself: Surely I will fill you with men, as many as locusts, and they shall raise the shout of victory over you.
24Jr 51:15 "It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 51:16 When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 51:17 Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are false, and there is no breath in them.
24Jr 51:18 They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
24Jr 51:19 Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.
24Jr 51:20 "You are my hammer and weapon of war: with you I break nations in pieces; with you I destroy kingdoms;
24Jr 51:21 with you I break in pieces the horse and his rider; with you I break in pieces the chariot and the charioteer;
24Jr 51:22 with you I break in pieces man and woman; with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth; with you I break in pieces the young man and the young woman;
24Jr 51:23 with you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; with you I break in pieces the farmer and his team; with you I break in pieces governors and commanders.
24Jr 51:24 "I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion, declares the LORD.
24Jr 51:25 "Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, declares the LORD, which destroys the whole earth; I will stretch out my hand against you, and roll you down from the crags, and make you a burnt mountain.
24Jr 51:26 No stone shall be taken from you for a corner and no stone for a foundation, but you shall be a perpetual waste, declares the LORD.
24Jr 51:27 "Set up a standard on the earth; blow the trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations for war against her; summon against her the kingdoms, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a marshal against her; bring up horses like bristling locusts.
24Jr 51:28 Prepare the nations for war against her, the kings of the Medes, with their governors and deputies, and every land under their dominion.
24Jr 51:29 The land trembles and writhes in pain, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
24Jr 51:30 The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds; their strength has failed; they have become women; her dwellings are on fire; her bars are broken.
24Jr 51:31 One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side;
24Jr 51:32 the fords have been seized, the marshes are burned with fire, and the soldiers are in panic.
24Jr 51:33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while and the time of her harvest will come."
24Jr 51:34 "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a monster; he has filled his stomach with my delicacies; he has rinsed me out.
24Jr 51:35 The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon," let the inhabitant of Zion say. "My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," let Jerusalem say.
24Jr 51:36 Therefore thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry,
24Jr 51:37 and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins, the haunt of jackals, a horror and a hissing, without inhabitant.
24Jr 51:38 "They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions' cubs.
24Jr 51:39 While they are inflamed I will prepare them a feast and make them drunk, that they may become merry, then sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake, declares the LORD.
24Jr 51:40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and male goats.
24Jr 51:41 "How Babylon is taken, the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
24Jr 51:42 The sea has come up on Babylon; she is covered with its tumultuous waves.
24Jr 51:43 Her cities have become a horror, a land of drought and a desert, a land in which no one dwells, and through which no son of man passes.
24Jr 51:44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and take out of his mouth what he has swallowed. The nations shall no longer flow to him; the wall of Babylon has fallen.
24Jr 51:45 "Go out of the midst of her, my people! Let every one save his life from the fierce anger of the LORD!
24Jr 51:46 Let not your heart faint, and be not fearful at the report heard in the land, when a report comes in one year and afterward a report in another year, and violence is in the land, and ruler is against ruler.
24Jr 51:47 "Therefore, behold, the days are coming when I will punish the images of Babylon; her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
24Jr 51:48 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall sing for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north, declares the LORD.
24Jr 51:49 Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel, just as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.
24Jr 51:50 "You who have escaped from the sword, go, do not stand still! Remember the LORD from far away, and let Jerusalem come into your mind:
24Jr 51:51 'We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach; dishonor has covered our face, for foreigners have come into the holy places of the LORD's house.'
24Jr 51:52 "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will execute judgment upon her images, and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
24Jr 51:53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strong height, yet destroyers would come from me against her, declares the LORD.
24Jr 51:54 "A voice! A cry from Babylon! The noise of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
24Jr 51:55 For the LORD is laying Babylon waste and stilling her mighty voice. Their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is raised,
24Jr 51:56 for a destroyer has come upon her, upon Babylon; her warriors are taken; their bows are broken in pieces, for the LORD is a God of recompense; he will surely repay.
24Jr 51:57 I will make drunk her officials and her wise men, her governors, her commanders, and her warriors; they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 51:58 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: The broad wall of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground, and her high gates shall be burned with fire. The peoples labor for nothing, and the nations weary themselves only for fire."
24Jr 51:59 The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.
24Jr 51:60 Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
24Jr 51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: "When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
24Jr 51:62 and say, 'O LORD, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be desolate forever.'
24Jr 51:63 When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates,
24Jr 51:64 and say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall become exhausted.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24Jr 52:2 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
24Jr 52:3 For because of the anger of the LORD things came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24Jr 52:4 And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.
24Jr 52:5 So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
24Jr 52:6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
24Jr 52:7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
24Jr 52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.
24Jr 52:9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
24Jr 52:10 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.
24Jr 52:11 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
24Jr 52:12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month--that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon--Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:13 And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
24Jr 52:14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:15 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
24Jr 52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
24Jr 52:17 And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24Jr 52:18 And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;
24Jr 52:19 also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the dishes for incense and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
24Jr 52:20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.
24Jr 52:21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.
24Jr 52:22 On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates.
24Jr 52:23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.
24Jr 52:24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;
24Jr 52:25 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
24Jr 52:26 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24Jr 52:27 And the king of Babylon struck them down, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
24Jr 52:28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;
24Jr 52:29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;
24Jr 52:30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.
24Jr 52:31 And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, graciously freed Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
24Jr 52:32 And he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
24Jr 52:33 So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,
24Jr 52:34 and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death, as long as he lived.

25Lm 1:1 How lonely sits the city that was full of people! How like a widow has she become, she who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave.
25Lm 1:2 She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies.
25Lm 1:3 Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and hard servitude; she dwells now among the nations, but finds no resting place; her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
25Lm 1:4 The roads to Zion mourn, for none come to the festival; all her gates are desolate; her priests groan; her virgins have been afflicted, and she herself suffers bitterly.
25Lm 1:5 Her foes have become the head; her enemies prosper, because the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe.
25Lm 1:6 From the daughter of Zion all her majesty has departed. Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture; they fled without strength before the pursuer.
25Lm 1:7 Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and wandering all the precious things that were hers from days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was none to help her, her foes gloated over her; they mocked at her downfall.
25Lm 1:8 Jerusalem sinned grievously; therefore she became filthy; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns her face away.
25Lm 1:9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she took no thought of her future; therefore her fall is terrible; she has no comforter. "O LORD, behold my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!"
25Lm 1:10 The enemy has stretched out his hands over all her precious things; for she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, those whom you forbade to enter your congregation.
25Lm 1:11 All her people groan as they search for bread; they trade their treasures for food to revive their strength. "Look, O LORD, and see, for I am despised."
25Lm 1:12 "Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was brought upon me, which the LORD inflicted on the day of his fierce anger.
25Lm 1:13 "From on high he sent fire; into my bones he made it descend; he spread a net for my feet; he turned me back; he has left me stunned, faint all the day long.
25Lm 1:14 "My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together; they were set upon my neck; he caused my strength to fail; the Lord gave me into the hands of those whom I cannot withstand.
25Lm 1:15 "The Lord rejected all my mighty men in my midst; he summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.
25Lm 1:16 "For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my spirit; my children are desolate, for the enemy has prevailed."
25Lm 1:17 Zion stretches out her hands, but there is none to comfort her; the LORD has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors should be his foes; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them.
25Lm 1:18 "The LORD is in the right, for I have rebelled against his word; but hear, all you peoples, and see my suffering; my young women and my young men have gone into captivity.
25Lm 1:19 "I called to my lovers, but they deceived me; my priests and elders perished in the city, while they sought food to revive their strength.
25Lm 1:20 "Look, O LORD, for I am in distress; my stomach churns; my heart is wrung within me, because I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword bereaves; in the house it is like death.
25Lm 1:21 "They heard my groaning, yet there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it. You have brought the day you announced; now let them be as I am.
25Lm 1:22 "Let all their evildoing come before you, and deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions; for my groans are many, and my heart is faint."
25Lm 2:1 How the Lord in his anger has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud! He has cast down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
25Lm 2:2 The Lord has swallowed up without mercy all the habitations of Jacob; in his wrath he has broken down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; he has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its rulers.
25Lm 2:3 He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn from them his right hand in the face of the enemy; he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob, consuming all around.
25Lm 2:4 He has bent his bow like an enemy, with his right hand set like a foe; and he has killed all who were delightful in our eyes in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire.
25Lm 2:5 The Lord has become like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel; he has swallowed up all its palaces; he has laid in ruins its strongholds, and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
25Lm 2:6 He has laid waste his booth like a garden, laid in ruins his meeting place; the LORD has made Zion forget festival and Sabbath, and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest.
25Lm 2:7 The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary; he has delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they raised a clamor in the house of the LORD as on the day of festival.
25Lm 2:8 The LORD determined to lay in ruins the wall of the daughter of Zion; he stretched out the measuring line; he did not restrain his hand from destroying; he caused rampart and wall to lament; they languished together.
25Lm 2:9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken her bars; her king and princes are among the nations; the law is no more, and her prophets find no vision from the LORD.
25Lm 2:10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth; the young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
25Lm 2:11 My eyes are spent with weeping; my stomach churns; my bile is poured out to the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because infants and babies faint in the streets of the city.
25Lm 2:12 They cry to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like a wounded man in the streets of the city, as their life is poured out on their mothers' bosom.
25Lm 2:13 What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is vast as the sea; who can heal you?
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but have seen for you oracles that are false and misleading.
25Lm 2:15 All who pass along the way clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?"
25Lm 2:16 All your enemies rail against you; they hiss, they gnash their teeth, they cry: "We have swallowed her! Ah, this is the day we longed for; now we have it; we see it!"
25Lm 2:17 The LORD has done what he purposed; he has carried out his word, which he commanded long ago; he has thrown down without pity; he has made the enemy rejoice over you and exalted the might of your foes.
25Lm 2:18 Their heart cried to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears stream down like a torrent day and night! Give yourself no rest, your eyes no respite!
25Lm 2:19 "Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches! Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord! Lift your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint for hunger at the head of every street."
25Lm 2:20 Look, O LORD, and see! With whom have you dealt thus? Should women eat the fruit of their womb, the children of their tender care? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
25Lm 2:21 In the dust of the streets lie the young and the old; my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword; you have killed them in the day of your anger, slaughtering without pity.
25Lm 2:22 You summoned as if to a festival day my terrors on every side, and on the day of the anger of the LORD no one escaped or survived; those whom I held and raised my enemy destroyed.
25Lm 3:1 I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath;
25Lm 3:2 he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;
25Lm 3:3 surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long.
25Lm 3:4 He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; he has broken my bones;
25Lm 3:5 he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;
25Lm 3:6 he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago.
25Lm 3:7 He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has made my chains heavy;
25Lm 3:8 though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;
25Lm 3:9 he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones; he has made my paths crooked.
25Lm 3:10 He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;
25Lm 3:11 he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;
25Lm 3:12 he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow.
25Lm 3:13 He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver;
25Lm 3:14 I have become the laughingstock of all peoples, the object of their taunts all day long.
25Lm 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood.
25Lm 3:16 He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;
25Lm 3:17 my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;
25Lm 3:18 so I say, "My endurance has perished; so has my hope from the LORD."
25Lm 3:19 Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall!
25Lm 3:20 My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me.
25Lm 3:21 But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:
25Lm 3:22 The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end;
25Lm 3:23 they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
25Lm 3:24 "The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."
25Lm 3:25 The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
25Lm 3:26 It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
25Lm 3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
25Lm 3:28 Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him;
25Lm 3:29 let him put his mouth in the dust-- there may yet be hope;
25Lm 3:30 let him give his cheek to the one who strikes, and let him be filled with insults.
25Lm 3:31 For the Lord will not cast off forever,
25Lm 3:32 but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;
25Lm 3:33 for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men.
25Lm 3:34 To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth,
25Lm 3:35 to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High,
25Lm 3:36 to subvert a man in his lawsuit, the Lord does not approve.
25Lm 3:37 Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it?
25Lm 3:38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?
25Lm 3:39 Why should a living man complain, a man, about the punishment of his sins?
25Lm 3:40 Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD!
25Lm 3:41 Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:
25Lm 3:42 "We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.
25Lm 3:43 "You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;
25Lm 3:44 you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
25Lm 3:45 You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples.
25Lm 3:46 "All our enemies open their mouths against us;
25Lm 3:47 panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction;
25Lm 3:48 my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
25Lm 3:49 "My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,
25Lm 3:50 until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees;
25Lm 3:51 my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city.
25Lm 3:52 "I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause;
25Lm 3:53 they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me;
25Lm 3:54 water closed over my head; I said, 'I am lost.'
25Lm 3:55 "I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit;
25Lm 3:56 you heard my plea, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help!'
25Lm 3:57 You came near when I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear!'
25Lm 3:58 "You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life.
25Lm 3:59 You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause.
25Lm 3:60 You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:61 "You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:62 The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long.
25Lm 3:63 Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their taunts.
25Lm 3:64 "You will repay them, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
25Lm 3:65 You will give them dullness of heart; your curse will be on them.
25Lm 3:66 You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens, O LORD."
25Lm 4:1 How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed! The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street.
25Lm 4:2 The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are regarded as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!
25Lm 4:3 Even jackals offer the breast; they nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:4 The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives to them.
25Lm 4:5 Those who once feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple embrace ash heaps.
25Lm 4:6 For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands were wrung for her.
25Lm 4:7 Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire.
25Lm 4:8 Now their face is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.
25Lm 4:9 Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who wasted away, pierced by lack of the fruits of the field.
25Lm 4:10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food during the destruction of the daughter of my people.
25Lm 4:11 The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations.
25Lm 4:12 The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25Lm 4:13 This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous.
25Lm 4:14 They wandered, blind, through the streets; they were so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments.
25Lm 4:15 "Away! Unclean!" people cried at them. "Away! Away! Do not touch!" So they became fugitives and wanderers; people said among the nations, "They shall stay with us no longer."
25Lm 4:16 The LORD himself has scattered them; he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders.
25Lm 4:17 Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save.
25Lm 4:18 They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered, for our end had come.
25Lm 4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains; they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, was captured in their pits, of whom we said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the nations."
25Lm 4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.
25Lm 4:22 The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished; he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish; he will uncover your sins.
25Lm 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace!
25Lm 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.
25Lm 5:3 We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows.
25Lm 5:4 We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought.
25Lm 5:5 Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest.
25Lm 5:6 We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough.
25Lm 5:7 Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities.
25Lm 5:8 Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand.
25Lm 5:9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness.
25Lm 5:10 Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine.
25Lm 5:11 Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah.
25Lm 5:12 Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders.
25Lm 5:13 Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood.
25Lm 5:14 The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music.
25Lm 5:15 The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning.
25Lm 5:16 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!
25Lm 5:17 For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim,
25Lm 5:18 for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it.
25Lm 5:19 But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations.
25Lm 5:20 Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days?
25Lm 5:21 Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old--
25Lm 5:22 unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us.

26Ezk 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
26Ezk 1:2 On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin),
26Ezk 1:3 the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal, and the hand of the LORD was upon him there.
26Ezk 1:4 As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal.
26Ezk 1:5 And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,
26Ezk 1:6 but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
26Ezk 1:7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze.
26Ezk 1:8 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
26Ezk 1:9 their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went.
26Ezk 1:10 As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
26Ezk 1:11 Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.
26Ezk 1:12 And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.
26Ezk 1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
26Ezk 1:14 And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
26Ezk 1:15 Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
26Ezk 1:16 As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 1:17 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went.
26Ezk 1:18 And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
26Ezk 1:19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
26Ezk 1:20 Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:22 Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads.
26Ezk 1:23 And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. And each creature had two wings covering its body.
26Ezk 1:24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
26Ezk 1:25 And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
26Ezk 1:26 And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance.
26Ezk 1:27 And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.
26Ezk 1:28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
26Ezk 2:1 And he said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you."
26Ezk 2:2 And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
26Ezk 2:3 And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
26Ezk 2:4 The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'
26Ezk 2:5 And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26Ezk 2:6 And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 2:7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 2:8 "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."
26Ezk 2:9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.
26Ezk 2:10 And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
26Ezk 3:1 And he said to me, "Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
26Ezk 3:3 And he said to me, "Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it." Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
26Ezk 3:4 And he said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.
26Ezk 3:5 For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel--
26Ezk 3:6 not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
26Ezk 3:7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
26Ezk 3:8 Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
26Ezk 3:9 Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house."
26Ezk 3:10 Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
26Ezk 3:11 And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' whether they hear or refuse to hear."
26Ezk 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake: "Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!"
26Ezk 3:13 It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake.
26Ezk 3:14 The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me.
26Ezk 3:15 And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
26Ezk 3:16 And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 3:17 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
26Ezk 3:18 If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 3:19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
26Ezk 3:20 Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 3:21 But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul."
26Ezk 3:22 And the hand of the LORD was upon me there. And he said to me, "Arise, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you."
26Ezk 3:23 So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the Chebar canal, and I fell on my face.
26Ezk 3:24 But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house.
26Ezk 3:25 And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
26Ezk 3:26 And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 3:27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 4:1 "And you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.
26Ezk 4:2 And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.
26Ezk 4:3 And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:4 "Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment.
26Ezk 4:5 For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:6 And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
26Ezk 4:7 And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
26Ezk 4:8 And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.
26Ezk 4:9 "And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it.
26Ezk 4:10 And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it.
26Ezk 4:11 And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from day to day you shall drink.
26Ezk 4:12 And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung."
26Ezk 4:13 And the LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them."
26Ezk 4:14 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never defiled myself. From my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has tainted meat come into my mouth."
26Ezk 4:15 Then he said to me, "See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread."
26Ezk 4:16 Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay.
26Ezk 4:17 I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and rot away because of their punishment.
26Ezk 5:1 "And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair.
26Ezk 5:2 A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
26Ezk 5:3 And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
26Ezk 5:4 And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
26Ezk 5:5 "Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
26Ezk 5:6 And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes.
26Ezk 5:7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, and have not even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you,
26Ezk 5:8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you. And I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 5:9 And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.
26Ezk 5:10 Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds.
26Ezk 5:11 Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
26Ezk 5:12 A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
26Ezk 5:13 "Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the LORD--that I have spoken in my jealousy--when I spend my fury upon them.
26Ezk 5:14 Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by.
26Ezk 5:15 You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes--I am the LORD; I have spoken--
26Ezk 5:16 when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread.
26Ezk 5:17 I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken."
26Ezk 6:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 6:2 "Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
26Ezk 6:3 and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
26Ezk 6:4 Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
26Ezk 6:5 And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
26Ezk 6:6 Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
26Ezk 6:7 And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 6:8 "Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,
26Ezk 6:9 then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations.
26Ezk 6:10 And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them."
26Ezk 6:11 Thus says the Lord GOD: "Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
26Ezk 6:12 He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
26Ezk 6:13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols.
26Ezk 6:14 And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 7:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 7:2 "And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
26Ezk 7:3 Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:4 And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 7:5 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes.
26Ezk 7:6 An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.
26Ezk 7:7 Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains.
26Ezk 7:8 Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:9 And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.
26Ezk 7:10 "Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
26Ezk 7:11 Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them.
26Ezk 7:12 The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
26Ezk 7:13 For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.
26Ezk 7:14 "They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
26Ezk 7:15 The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour.
26Ezk 7:16 And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
26Ezk 7:17 All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
26Ezk 7:18 They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.
26Ezk 7:19 They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
26Ezk 7:20 His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them.
26Ezk 7:21 And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it.
26Ezk 7:22 I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.
26Ezk 7:23 "Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.
26Ezk 7:24 I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.
26Ezk 7:25 When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
26Ezk 7:26 Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders.
26Ezk 7:27 The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 8:1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
26Ezk 8:2 Then I looked, and behold, a form that had the appearance of a man. Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal.
26Ezk 8:3 He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
26Ezk 8:4 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.
26Ezk 8:5 Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.
26Ezk 8:6 And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations."
26Ezk 8:7 And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
26Ezk 8:8 Then he said to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall." So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
26Ezk 8:9 And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here."
26Ezk 8:10 So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 8:11 And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
26Ezk 8:12 Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'"
26Ezk 8:13 He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations that they commit."
26Ezk 8:14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
26Ezk 8:15 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these."
26Ezk 8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.
26Ezk 8:17 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose.
26Ezk 8:18 Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them."
26Ezk 9:1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, "Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."
26Ezk 9:2 And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
26Ezk 9:3 Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
26Ezk 9:4 And the LORD said to him, "Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it."
26Ezk 9:5 And to the others he said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
26Ezk 9:6 Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house.
26Ezk 9:7 Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out." So they went out and struck in the city.
26Ezk 9:8 And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"
26Ezk 9:9 Then he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'
26Ezk 9:10 As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their deeds upon their heads."
26Ezk 9:11 And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
26Ezk 10:1 Then I looked, and behold, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne.
26Ezk 10:2 And he said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city." And he went in before my eyes.
26Ezk 10:3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
26Ezk 10:4 And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
26Ezk 10:5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
26Ezk 10:6 And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.
26Ezk 10:7 And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
26Ezk 10:8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
26Ezk 10:9 And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl.
26Ezk 10:10 And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
26Ezk 10:11 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without turning as they went.
26Ezk 10:12 And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around--the wheels that the four of them had.
26Ezk 10:13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing "the whirling wheels."
26Ezk 10:14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
26Ezk 10:15 And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the Chebar canal.
26Ezk 10:16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.
26Ezk 10:17 When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
26Ezk 10:18 Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
26Ezk 10:19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
26Ezk 10:20 These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal; and I knew that they were cherubim.
26Ezk 10:21 Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the likeness of human hands.
26Ezk 10:22 And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal. Each one of them went straight forward.
26Ezk 11:1 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
26Ezk 11:2 And he said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
26Ezk 11:3 who say, 'The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.'
26Ezk 11:4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."
26Ezk 11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, "Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.
26Ezk 11:6 You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
26Ezk 11:7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
26Ezk 11:8 You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 11:9 And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.
26Ezk 11:10 You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 11:11 This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
26Ezk 11:12 and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you."
26Ezk 11:13 And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
26Ezk 11:14 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 11:15 "Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.'
26Ezk 11:16 Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.'
26Ezk 11:17 Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.'
26Ezk 11:18 And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
26Ezk 11:19 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
26Ezk 11:20 that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
26Ezk 11:21 But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 11:22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
26Ezk 11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
26Ezk 11:24 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
26Ezk 11:25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
26Ezk 12:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:2 "Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:3 As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
26Ezk 12:5 In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
26Ezk 12:6 In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel."
26Ezk 12:7 And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
26Ezk 12:8 In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:9 "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?'
26Ezk 12:10 Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.'
26Ezk 12:11 Say, 'I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.'
26Ezk 12:12 And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
26Ezk 12:13 And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
26Ezk 12:14 And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
26Ezk 12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
26Ezk 12:16 But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 12:17 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:18 "Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety.
26Ezk 12:19 And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay. In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
26Ezk 12:20 And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 12:21 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:22 "Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, 'The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing'?
26Ezk 12:23 Tell them therefore, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.' But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision.
26Ezk 12:24 For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
26Ezk 12:25 For I am the LORD; I will speak the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 12:26 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:27 "Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.'
26Ezk 12:28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 13:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 13:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts: 'Hear the word of the LORD!'
26Ezk 13:3 Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
26Ezk 13:4 Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel.
26Ezk 13:5 You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD.
26Ezk 13:6 They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'Declares the LORD,' when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word.
26Ezk 13:7 Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, 'Declares the LORD,' although I have not spoken?"
26Ezk 13:8 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:9 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:10 Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, 'Peace,' when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash,
26Ezk 13:11 say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out.
26Ezk 13:12 And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, 'Where is the coating with which you smeared it?'
26Ezk 13:13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end.
26Ezk 13:14 And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:15 Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,
26Ezk 13:16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:17 "And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own minds. Prophesy against them
26Ezk 13:18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?
26Ezk 13:19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.
26Ezk 13:20 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds.
26Ezk 13:21 Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:22 Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,
26Ezk 13:23 therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 14:1 Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
26Ezk 14:2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:3 "Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
26Ezk 14:4 Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,
26Ezk 14:5 that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.
26Ezk 14:6 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
26Ezk 14:7 For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself.
26Ezk 14:8 And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 14:9 And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
26Ezk 14:10 And they shall bear their punishment--the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike--
26Ezk 14:11 that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 14:12 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
26Ezk 14:14 even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 14:15 "If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,
26Ezk 14:16 even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
26Ezk 14:17 "Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, Let a sword pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast,
26Ezk 14:18 though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
26Ezk 14:19 "Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
26Ezk 14:20 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness.
26Ezk 14:21 "For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
26Ezk 14:22 But behold, some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
26Ezk 14:23 They will console you, when you see their ways and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 15:1 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 15:2 "Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
26Ezk 15:3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
26Ezk 15:4 Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
26Ezk 15:5 Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
26Ezk 15:6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
26Ezk 15:7 And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
26Ezk 15:8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 16:1 Again the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 16:2 "Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
26Ezk 16:3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
26Ezk 16:4 And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
26Ezk 16:5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born.
26Ezk 16:6 "And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, 'Live!' I said to you in your blood, 'Live!'
26Ezk 16:7 I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.
26Ezk 16:8 "When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, and you became mine.
26Ezk 16:9 Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
26Ezk 16:10 I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
26Ezk 16:11 And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
26Ezk 16:12 And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
26Ezk 16:13 Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
26Ezk 16:14 And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 16:15 "But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore because of your renown and lavished your whorings on any passerby; your beauty became his.
26Ezk 16:16 You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be.
26Ezk 16:17 You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore.
26Ezk 16:18 And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
26Ezk 16:19 Also my bread that I gave you--I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey--you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 16:20 And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter
26Ezk 16:21 that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
26Ezk 16:22 And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood.
26Ezk 16:23 "And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD),
26Ezk 16:24 you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square.
26Ezk 16:25 At the head of every street you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring.
26Ezk 16:26 You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger.
26Ezk 16:27 Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
26Ezk 16:28 You played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied.
26Ezk 16:29 You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied.
26Ezk 16:30 "How sick is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute,
26Ezk 16:31 building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
26Ezk 16:32 Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
26Ezk 16:33 Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings.
26Ezk 16:34 So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different.
26Ezk 16:35 "Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 16:36 Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
26Ezk 16:37 therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
26Ezk 16:38 And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
26Ezk 16:39 And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare.
26Ezk 16:40 They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
26Ezk 16:41 And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more.
26Ezk 16:42 So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry.
26Ezk 16:43 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?
26Ezk 16:44 "Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'
26Ezk 16:45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26Ezk 16:46 And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
26Ezk 16:47 Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
26Ezk 16:48 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
26Ezk 16:49 Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.
26Ezk 16:50 They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it.
26Ezk 16:51 Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed.
26Ezk 16:52 Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
26Ezk 16:53 "I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst,
26Ezk 16:54 that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.
26Ezk 16:55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
26Ezk 16:56 Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,
26Ezk 16:57 before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.
26Ezk 16:58 You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.
26Ezk 16:59 "For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,
26Ezk 16:60 yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant.
26Ezk 16:61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you.
26Ezk 16:62 I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
26Ezk 16:63 that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 17:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:2 "Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
26Ezk 17:3 say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
26Ezk 17:4 He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
26Ezk 17:5 Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,
26Ezk 17:6 and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.
26Ezk 17:7 "And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
26Ezk 17:8 It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
26Ezk 17:9 "Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
26Ezk 17:10 Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it--wither away on the bed where it sprouted?"
26Ezk 17:11 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:12 "Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
26Ezk 17:13 And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath (the chief men of the land he had taken away),
26Ezk 17:14 that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
26Ezk 17:15 But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?
26Ezk 17:16 "As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
26Ezk 17:17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
26Ezk 17:18 He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
26Ezk 17:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
26Ezk 17:20 I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me.
26Ezk 17:21 And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken."
26Ezk 17:22 Thus says the Lord GOD: "I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
26Ezk 17:23 On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
26Ezk 17:24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD; I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it."
26Ezk 18:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 18:2 "What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'?
26Ezk 18:3 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
26Ezk 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die.
26Ezk 18:5 "If a man is righteous and does what is just and right--
26Ezk 18:6 if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,
26Ezk 18:7 does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
26Ezk 18:8 does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice, executes true justice between man and man,
26Ezk 18:9 walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully--he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 18:10 "If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
26Ezk 18:11 (though he himself did none of these things), who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,
26Ezk 18:13 lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.
26Ezk 18:14 "Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:
26Ezk 18:15 he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:16 does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
26Ezk 18:17 withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.
26Ezk 18:18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
26Ezk 18:19 "Yet you say, 'Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.
26Ezk 18:20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
26Ezk 18:21 "But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
26Ezk 18:22 None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
26Ezk 18:23 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?
26Ezk 18:24 But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.
26Ezk 18:25 "Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
26Ezk 18:26 When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
26Ezk 18:27 Again, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
26Ezk 18:28 Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
26Ezk 18:29 Yet the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
26Ezk 18:30 "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.
26Ezk 18:31 Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?
26Ezk 18:32 For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."
26Ezk 19:1 And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
26Ezk 19:2 and say: What was your mother? A lioness! Among lions she crouched; in the midst of young lions she reared her cubs.
26Ezk 19:3 And she brought up one of her cubs; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
26Ezk 19:4 The nations heard about him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 19:5 When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
26Ezk 19:6 He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men,
26Ezk 19:7 and seized their widows. He laid waste their cities, and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.
26Ezk 19:8 Then the nations set against him from provinces on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
26Ezk 19:9 With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 19:10 Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard planted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
26Ezk 19:11 Its strong stems became rulers' scepters; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
26Ezk 19:12 But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried up its fruit; they were stripped off and withered. As for its strong stem, fire consumed it.
26Ezk 19:13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
26Ezk 19:14 And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots, has consumed its fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation and has become a lamentation.
26Ezk 20:1 In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
26Ezk 20:2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:3 "Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
26Ezk 20:4 Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Let them know the abominations of their fathers,
26Ezk 20:5 and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:6 On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.
26Ezk 20:7 And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:8 But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:9 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:10 So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:11 I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live.
26Ezk 20:12 Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
26Ezk 20:13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.
26Ezk 20:14 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:15 Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,
26Ezk 20:16 because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
26Ezk 20:17 Nevertheless, my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:18 "And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
26Ezk 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to obey my rules,
26Ezk 20:20 and keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:21 But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:22 But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:23 Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
26Ezk 20:24 because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
26Ezk 20:25 Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,
26Ezk 20:26 and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:27 "Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.
26Ezk 20:28 For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
26Ezk 20:29 (I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.)
26Ezk 20:30 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go whoring after their detestable things?
26Ezk 20:31 When you present your gifts and offer up your children in fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
26Ezk 20:32 "What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, 'Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'
26Ezk 20:33 "As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be king over you.
26Ezk 20:34 I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out.
26Ezk 20:35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
26Ezk 20:36 As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 20:37 I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
26Ezk 20:38 I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me. I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:39 "As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.
26Ezk 20:40 "For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.
26Ezk 20:41 As a pleasing aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered. And I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 20:42 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your fathers.
26Ezk 20:43 And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.
26Ezk 20:44 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 20:45  And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:46 "Son of man, set your face toward the southland; preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb.
26Ezk 20:47 Say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
26Ezk 20:48 All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."
26Ezk 20:49 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not a maker of parables?'"
26Ezk 21:1  The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:2 "Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
26Ezk 21:3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
26Ezk 21:4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
26Ezk 21:5 And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.
26Ezk 21:6 "As for you, son of man, groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan before their eyes.
26Ezk 21:7 And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that it is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming, and it will be fulfilled,'" declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 21:8 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:9 "Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, say: "A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,
26Ezk 21:10 sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! (Or shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.)
26Ezk 21:11 So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.
26Ezk 21:12 Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike therefore upon your thigh.
26Ezk 21:13 For it will not be a testing--what could it do if you despise the rod?" declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 21:14 "As for you, son of man, prophesy. Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yes, three times, the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,
26Ezk 21:15 that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter.
26Ezk 21:16 Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed.
26Ezk 21:17 I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken."
26Ezk 21:18 The word of the LORD came to me again:
26Ezk 21:19 "As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city.
26Ezk 21:20 Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified.
26Ezk 21:21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver.
26Ezk 21:22 Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.
26Ezk 21:23 But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken.
26Ezk 21:24 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
26Ezk 21:25 And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment,
26Ezk 21:26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted.
26Ezk 21:27 A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.
26Ezk 21:28 "And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning--
26Ezk 21:29 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.
26Ezk 21:30 Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
26Ezk 21:31 And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy.
26Ezk 21:32 You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken."
26Ezk 22:1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26Ezk 22:2 "And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominations.
26Ezk 22:3 You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!
26Ezk 22:4 You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries.
26Ezk 22:5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; your name is defiled; you are full of tumult.
26Ezk 22:6 "Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
26Ezk 22:7 Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.
26Ezk 22:8 You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths.
26Ezk 22:9 There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst.
26Ezk 22:10 In you men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity.
26Ezk 22:11 One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter.
26Ezk 22:12 In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 22:13 "Behold, I strike my hand at the dishonest gain that you have made, and at the blood that has been in your midst.
26Ezk 22:14 Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
26Ezk 22:15 I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and I will consume your uncleanness out of you.
26Ezk 22:16 And you shall be profaned by your own doing in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 22:17 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are dross of silver.
26Ezk 22:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
26Ezk 22:20 As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, to blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you.
26Ezk 22:21 I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
26Ezk 22:22 As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have poured out my wrath upon you."
26Ezk 22:23 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:24 "Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation.
26Ezk 22:25 The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
26Ezk 22:26 Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
26Ezk 22:27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
26Ezk 22:28 And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken.
26Ezk 22:29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice.
26Ezk 22:30 And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.
26Ezk 22:31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 23:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 23:2 "Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
26Ezk 23:3 They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms handled.
26Ezk 23:4 Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
26Ezk 23:5 "Oholah played the whore while she was mine, and she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors
26Ezk 23:6 clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
26Ezk 23:7 She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted.
26Ezk 23:8 She did not give up her whoring that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
26Ezk 23:9 Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
26Ezk 23:10 These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed on her.
26Ezk 23:11 "Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became more corrupt than her sister in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister.
26Ezk 23:12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
26Ezk 23:13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
26Ezk 23:14 But she carried her whoring further. She saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
26Ezk 23:15 wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:16 When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust.
26Ezk 23:18 When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
26Ezk 23:19 Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
26Ezk 23:20 and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.
26Ezk 23:21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts."
26Ezk 23:22 Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
26Ezk 23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
26Ezk 23:24 And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
26Ezk 23:25 And I will direct my jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
26Ezk 23:26 They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
26Ezk 23:27 Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.
26Ezk 23:28 "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,
26Ezk 23:29 and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your whoring
26Ezk 23:30 have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
26Ezk 23:31 You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
26Ezk 23:32 Thus says the Lord GOD: "You shall drink your sister's cup that is deep and large; you shall be laughed at and held in derision, for it contains much;
26Ezk 23:33 you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria;
26Ezk 23:34 you shall drink it and drain it out, and gnaw its shards, and tear your breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 23:35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring."
26Ezk 23:36 The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations.
26Ezk 23:37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
26Ezk 23:38 Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths.
26Ezk 23:39 For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house.
26Ezk 23:40 They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
26Ezk 23:41 You sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.
26Ezk 23:42 The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort, drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26Ezk 23:43 "Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!
26Ezk 23:44 For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women!
26Ezk 23:45 But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands."
26Ezk 23:46 For thus says the Lord GOD: "Bring up a vast host against them, and make them an object of terror and a plunder.
26Ezk 23:47 And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses.
26Ezk 23:48 Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
26Ezk 23:49 And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry, and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 24:1 In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:2 "Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
26Ezk 24:3 And utter a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Set on the pot, set it on; pour in water also;
26Ezk 24:4 put in it the pieces of meat, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones.
26Ezk 24:5 Take the choicest one of the flock; pile the logs under it; boil it well; seethe also its bones in it.
26Ezk 24:6 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice.
26Ezk 24:7 For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
26Ezk 24:8 To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered.
26Ezk 24:9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
26Ezk 24:10 Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.
26Ezk 24:11 Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed.
26Ezk 24:12 She has wearied herself with toil; its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
26Ezk 24:13 On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, you shall not be cleansed anymore till I have satisfied my fury upon you.
26Ezk 24:14 I am the LORD. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; I will not spare; I will not relent; according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 24:15 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:16 "Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
26Ezk 24:17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men."
26Ezk 24:18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
26Ezk 24:19 And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?"
26Ezk 24:20 Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:21 'Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
26Ezk 24:22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
26Ezk 24:23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
26Ezk 24:24 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'
26Ezk 24:25 "As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul's desire, and also their sons and daughters,
26Ezk 24:26 on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
26Ezk 24:27 On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 25:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 25:2 "Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 25:3 Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,
26Ezk 25:4 therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
26Ezk 25:5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within your soul against the land of Israel,
26Ezk 25:7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:8 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,'
26Ezk 25:9 therefore I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities, from its cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
26Ezk 25:10 I will give it along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, that the Ammonites may be remembered no more among the nations,
26Ezk 25:11 and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:12 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance on them,
26Ezk 25:13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. And I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
26Ezk 25:14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 25:15 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines acted revengefully and took vengeance with malice of soul to destroy in never-ending enmity,
26Ezk 25:16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
26Ezk 25:17 I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them."
26Ezk 26:1 In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 26:2 "Son of man, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken; it has swung open to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,'
26Ezk 26:3 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
26Ezk 26:4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers, and I will scrape her soil from her and make her a bare rock.
26Ezk 26:5 She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. And she shall become plunder for the nations,
26Ezk 26:6 and her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 26:7 "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers.
26Ezk 26:8 He will kill with the sword your daughters on the mainland. He will set up a siege wall against you and throw up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you.
26Ezk 26:9 He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
26Ezk 26:10 His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached.
26Ezk 26:11 With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
26Ezk 26:12 They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. Your stones and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters.
26Ezk 26:13 And I will stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more.
26Ezk 26:14 I will make you a bare rock. You shall be a place for the spreading of nets. You shall never be rebuilt, for I am the LORD; I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 26:15 "Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in your midst?
26Ezk 26:16 Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones and remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground and tremble every moment and be appalled at you.
26Ezk 26:17 And they will raise a lamentation over you and say to you, "'How you have perished, you who were inhabited from the seas, O city renowned, who was mighty on the sea; she and her inhabitants imposed their terror on all her inhabitants!
26Ezk 26:18 Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall, and the coastlands that are on the sea are dismayed at your passing.'
26Ezk 26:19 "For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,
26Ezk 26:20 then I will make you go down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the world below, among ruins from of old, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set beauty in the land of the living.
26Ezk 26:21 I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more. Though you be sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 27:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 27:2 "Now you, son of man, raise a lamentation over Tyre,
26Ezk 27:3 and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrances to the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, thus says the Lord GOD: "O Tyre, you have said, 'I am perfect in beauty.'
26Ezk 27:4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders made perfect your beauty.
26Ezk 27:5 They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26Ezk 27:6 Of oaks of Bashan they made your oars; they made your deck of pines from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory.
26Ezk 27:7 Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail, serving as your banner; blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was your awning.
26Ezk 27:8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; your skilled men, O Tyre, were in you; they were your pilots.
26Ezk 27:9 The elders of Gebal and her skilled men were in you, caulking your seams; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to barter for your wares.
26Ezk 27:10 "Persia and Lud and Put were in your army as your men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor.
26Ezk 27:11 Men of Arvad and Helech were on your walls all around, and men of Gamad were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around; they made perfect your beauty.
26Ezk 27:12 "Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of every kind; silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your wares.
26Ezk 27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they exchanged human beings and vessels of bronze for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:14 From Beth-togarmah they exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your wares.
26Ezk 27:15 The men of Dedan traded with you. Many coastlands were your own special markets; they brought you in payment ivory tusks and ebony.
26Ezk 27:16 Syria did business with you because of your abundant goods; they exchanged for your wares emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and ruby.
26Ezk 27:17 Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, meal, honey, oil, and balm.
26Ezk 27:18 Damascus did business with you for your abundant goods, because of your great wealth of every kind; wine of Helbon and wool of Sahar
26Ezk 27:19 and casks of wine from Uzal they exchanged for your wares; wrought iron, cassia, and calamus were bartered for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:20 Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.
26Ezk 27:21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your favored dealers in lambs, rams, and goats; in these they did business with you.
26Ezk 27:22 The traders of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; they exchanged for your wares the best of all kinds of spices and all precious stones and gold.
26Ezk 27:23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you.
26Ezk 27:24 In your market these traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of blue and embroidered work, and in carpets of colored material, bound with cords and made secure.
26Ezk 27:25 The ships of Tarshish traveled for you with your merchandise. So you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 27:26 "Your rowers have brought you out into the high seas. The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 27:27 Your riches, your wares, your merchandise, your mariners and your pilots, your caulkers, your dealers in merchandise, and all your men of war who are in you, with all your crew that is in your midst, sink into the heart of the seas on the day of your fall.
26Ezk 27:28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside shakes,
26Ezk 27:29 and down from their ships come all who handle the oar. The mariners and all the pilots of the sea stand on the land
26Ezk 27:30 and shout aloud over you and cry out bitterly. They cast dust on their heads and wallow in ashes;
26Ezk 27:31 they make themselves bald for you and put sackcloth on their waist, and they weep over you in bitterness of soul, with bitter mourning.
26Ezk 27:32 In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you and lament over you: 'Who is like Tyre, like one destroyed in the midst of the sea?
26Ezk 27:33 When your wares came from the seas, you satisfied many peoples; with your abundant wealth and merchandise you enriched the kings of the earth.
26Ezk 27:34 Now you are wrecked by the seas, in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and all your crew in your midst have sunk with you.
26Ezk 27:35 All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you, and the hair of their kings bristles with horror; their faces are convulsed.
26Ezk 27:36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever.'"
26Ezk 28:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:2 "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Because your heart is proud, and you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are but a man, and no god, though you make your heart like the heart of a god--
26Ezk 28:3 you are indeed wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you;
26Ezk 28:4 by your wisdom and your understanding you have made wealth for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;
26Ezk 28:5 by your great wisdom in your trade you have increased your wealth, and your heart has become proud in your wealth--
26Ezk 28:6 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you make your heart like the heart of a god,
26Ezk 28:7 therefore, behold, I will bring foreigners upon you, the most ruthless of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.
26Ezk 28:8 They shall thrust you down into the pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 28:9 Will you still say, 'I am a god,' in the presence of those who kill you, though you are but a man, and no god, in the hands of those who slay you?
26Ezk 28:10 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners; for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 28:11 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:12 "Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: "You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26Ezk 28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared.
26Ezk 28:14 You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.
26Ezk 28:15 You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.
26Ezk 28:16 In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O guardian cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
26Ezk 28:17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.
26Ezk 28:18 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries; so I brought fire out from your midst; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you.
26Ezk 28:19 All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever."
26Ezk 28:20 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:21 "Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her
26Ezk 28:22 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will manifest my glory in your midst. And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her and manifest my holiness in her;
26Ezk 28:23 for I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the slain shall fall in her midst, by the sword that is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 28:24 "And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 28:25 "Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
26Ezk 28:26 And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God."
26Ezk 29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:2 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt;
26Ezk 29:3 speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, 'My Nile is my own; I made it for myself.'
26Ezk 29:4 I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales; and I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams, with all the fish of your streams that stick to your scales.
26Ezk 29:5 And I will cast you out into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your streams; you shall fall on the open field, and not be brought together or gathered. To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens I give you as food.
26Ezk 29:6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD. "Because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel,
26Ezk 29:7 when they grasped you with the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins to shake.
26Ezk 29:8 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast,
26Ezk 29:9 and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. "Because you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I made it,'
26Ezk 29:10 therefore, behold, I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush.
26Ezk 29:11 No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.
26Ezk 29:12 And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.
26Ezk 29:13 "For thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered,
26Ezk 29:14 and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.
26Ezk 29:15 It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.
26Ezk 29:16 And it shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel, recalling their iniquity, when they turn to them for aid. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 29:17 In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:18 "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare, yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against her.
26Ezk 29:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army.
26Ezk 29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored, because they worked for me, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 29:21 "On that day I will cause a horn to spring up for the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 30:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:2 "Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Wail, 'Alas for the day!'
26Ezk 30:3 For the day is near, the day of the LORD is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
26Ezk 30:4 A sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Cush, when the slain fall in Egypt, and her wealth is carried away, and her foundations are torn down.
26Ezk 30:5 Cush, and Put, and Lud, and all Arabia, and Libya, and the people of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
26Ezk 30:6 "Thus says the LORD: Those who support Egypt shall fall, and her proud might shall come down; from Migdol to Syene they shall fall within her by the sword, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 30:7 And they shall be desolated in the midst of desolated countries, and their cities shall be in the midst of cities that are laid waste.
26Ezk 30:8 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have set fire to Egypt, and all her helpers are broken.
26Ezk 30:9 "On that day messengers shall go out from me in ships to terrify the unsuspecting people of Cush, and anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt's doom; for, behold, it comes!
26Ezk 30:10 "Thus says the Lord GOD: "I will put an end to the wealth of Egypt, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26Ezk 30:11 He and his people with him, the most ruthless of nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land, and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
26Ezk 30:12 And I will dry up the Nile and will sell the land into the hand of evildoers; I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it, by the hand of foreigners; I am the LORD; I have spoken.
26Ezk 30:13 "Thus says the Lord GOD: "I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis; there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt; so I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 30:14 I will make Pathros a desolation and will set fire to Zoan and will execute judgments on Thebes.
26Ezk 30:15 And I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the multitude of Thebes.
26Ezk 30:16 And I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium shall be in great agony; Thebes shall be breached, and Memphis shall face enemies by day.
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of On and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:18 At Tehaphnehes the day shall be dark, when I break there the yoke bars of Egypt, and her proud might shall come to an end in her; she shall be covered by a cloud, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:19 Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 30:20 In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:21 "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword.
26Ezk 30:22 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong arm and the one that was broken, and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
26Ezk 30:23 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
26Ezk 30:24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a man mortally wounded.
26Ezk 30:25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 30:26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 31:1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 31:2 "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: "Whom are you like in your greatness?
26Ezk 31:3 Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches and forest shade, and of towering height, its top among the clouds.
26Ezk 31:4 The waters nourished it; the deep made it grow tall, making its rivers flow around the place of its planting, sending forth its streams to all the trees of the field.
26Ezk 31:5 So it towered high above all the trees of the field; its boughs grew large and its branches long from abundant water in its shoots.
26Ezk 31:6 All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young, and under its shadow lived all great nations.
26Ezk 31:7 It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its roots went down to abundant waters.
26Ezk 31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor the fir trees equal its boughs; neither were the plane trees like its branches; no tree in the garden of God was its equal in beauty.
26Ezk 31:9 I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees of Eden envied it, that were in the garden of God.
26Ezk 31:10 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds, and its heart was proud of its height,
26Ezk 31:11 I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out.
26Ezk 31:12 Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations, have cut it down and left it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it.
26Ezk 31:13 On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field.
26Ezk 31:14 All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height. For they are all given over to death, to the world below, among the children of man, with those who go down to the pit.
26Ezk 31:15 "Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day the cedar went down to Sheol I caused mourning; I closed the deep over it, and restrained its rivers, and many waters were stopped. I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
26Ezk 31:16 I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the world below.
26Ezk 31:17 They also went down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were its arm, who lived under its shadow among the nations.
26Ezk 31:18 "Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below. You shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 32:1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:2 "Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: "You consider yourself a lion of the nations, but you are like a dragon in the seas; you burst forth in your rivers, trouble the waters with your feet, and foul their rivers.
26Ezk 32:3 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will throw my net over you with a host of many peoples, and they will haul you up in my dragnet.
26Ezk 32:4 And I will cast you on the ground; on the open field I will fling you, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle on you, and I will gorge the beasts of the whole earth with you.
26Ezk 32:5 I will strew your flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with your carcass.
26Ezk 32:6 I will drench the land even to the mountains with your flowing blood, and the ravines will be full of you.
26Ezk 32:7 When I blot you out, I will cover the heavens and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
26Ezk 32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and put darkness on your land, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:9 "I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries that you have not known.
26Ezk 32:10 I will make many peoples appalled at you, and the hair of their kings shall bristle with horror because of you, when I brandish my sword before them. They shall tremble every moment, every one for his own life, on the day of your downfall.
26Ezk 32:11 "For thus says the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
26Ezk 32:12 I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them most ruthless of nations. "They shall bring to ruin the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude shall perish.
26Ezk 32:13 I will destroy all its beasts from beside many waters; and no foot of man shall trouble them anymore, nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
26Ezk 32:14 Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:15 When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and when the land is desolate of all that fills it, when I strike down all who dwell in it, then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 32:16 This is a lamentation that shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they chant it, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 32:17 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:18 "Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and send them down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, to the world below, to those who have gone down to the pit:
26Ezk 32:19 'Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised.'
26Ezk 32:20 They shall fall amid those who are slain by the sword. Egypt is delivered to the sword; drag her away, and all her multitudes.
26Ezk 32:21 The mighty chiefs shall speak of them, with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol: 'They have come down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.'
26Ezk 32:22 "Assyria is there, and all her company, its graves all around it, all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
26Ezk 32:23 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit; and her company is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:24 "Elam is there, and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the world below, who spread their terror in the land of the living; and they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26Ezk 32:25 They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude, her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for terror of them was spread in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are placed among the slain.
26Ezk 32:26 "Meshech-Tubal is there, and all her multitude, her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they spread their terror in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:27 And they do not lie with the mighty, the fallen from among the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were laid under their heads, and whose iniquities are upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty men was in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:28 But as for you, you shall be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.
26Ezk 32:29 "Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with those who are killed by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit.
26Ezk 32:30 "The princes of the north are there, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down in shame with the slain, for all the terror that they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26Ezk 32:31 "When Pharaoh sees them, he will be comforted for all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:32 For I spread terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 33:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:2 "Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman,
26Ezk 33:3 and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people,
26Ezk 33:4 then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
26Ezk 33:5 He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.
26Ezk 33:6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.
26Ezk 33:7 "So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
26Ezk 33:8 If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 33:9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
26Ezk 33:10 "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: 'Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we rot away because of them. How then can we live?'
26Ezk 33:11 Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?
26Ezk 33:12 "And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness, and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness when he sins.
26Ezk 33:13 Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his injustice that he has done he shall die.
26Ezk 33:14 Again, though I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' yet if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right,
26Ezk 33:15 if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, not doing injustice, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
26Ezk 33:16 None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he shall surely live.
26Ezk 33:17 "Yet your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just,' when it is their own way that is not just.
26Ezk 33:18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it.
26Ezk 33:19 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall live by this.
26Ezk 33:20 Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways."
26Ezk 33:21 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has been struck down."
26Ezk 33:22 Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning, so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
26Ezk 33:23 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:24 "Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, 'Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.'
26Ezk 33:25 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood and lift up your eyes to your idols and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
26Ezk 33:26 You rely on the sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
26Ezk 33:27 Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
26Ezk 33:28 And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and her proud might shall come to an end, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through.
26Ezk 33:29 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.
26Ezk 33:30 "As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, 'Come, and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.'
26Ezk 33:31 And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain.
26Ezk 33:32 And behold, you are to them like one who sings lustful songs with a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear what you say, but they will not do it.
26Ezk 33:33 When this comes--and come it will!--then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
26Ezk 34:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 34:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?
26Ezk 34:3 You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.
26Ezk 34:4 The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.
26Ezk 34:5 So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts.
26Ezk 34:6 My sheep were scattered; they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.
26Ezk 34:7 "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 34:8 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep,
26Ezk 34:9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 34:10 Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.
26Ezk 34:11 "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out.
26Ezk 34:12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.
26Ezk 34:13 And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
26Ezk 34:14 I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 34:15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 34:16 I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.
26Ezk 34:17 "As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.
26Ezk 34:18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?
26Ezk 34:19 And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
26Ezk 34:20 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26Ezk 34:21 Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,
26Ezk 34:22 I will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
26Ezk 34:23 And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
26Ezk 34:24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I am the LORD; I have spoken.
26Ezk 34:25 "I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
26Ezk 34:26 And I will make them and the places all around my hill a blessing, and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.
26Ezk 34:27 And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
26Ezk 34:28 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
26Ezk 34:29 And I will provide for them renowned plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations.
26Ezk 34:30 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 34:31 And you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 35:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 35:2 "Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
26Ezk 35:3 and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste.
26Ezk 35:4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:5 Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment,
26Ezk 35:6 therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you.
26Ezk 35:7 I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it all who come and go.
26Ezk 35:8 And I will fill its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall.
26Ezk 35:9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:10 "Because you said, 'These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them'--although the LORD was there--
26Ezk 35:11 therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them, when I judge you.
26Ezk 35:12 And you shall know that I am the LORD. "I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given us to devour.'
26Ezk 35:13 And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it.
26Ezk 35:14 Thus says the Lord GOD: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
26Ezk 35:15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:1 "And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 36:2 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, 'Aha!' and, 'The ancient heights have become our possession,'
26Ezk 36:3 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Precisely because they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,
26Ezk 36:4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,
26Ezk 36:5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey.
26Ezk 36:6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations.
26Ezk 36:7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer reproach.
26Ezk 36:8 "But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they will soon come home.
26Ezk 36:9 For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.
26Ezk 36:10 And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:11 And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:12 I will let people walk on you, even my people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children.
26Ezk 36:13 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they say to you, 'You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,'
26Ezk 36:14 therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 36:15 And I will not let you hear anymore the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 36:16 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 36:17 "Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.
26Ezk 36:18 So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it.
26Ezk 36:19 I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.
26Ezk 36:20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.'
26Ezk 36:21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.
26Ezk 36:22 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.
26Ezk 36:23 And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
26Ezk 36:24 I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.
26Ezk 36:25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
26Ezk 36:26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
26Ezk 36:27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.
26Ezk 36:28 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
26Ezk 36:29 And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you.
26Ezk 36:30 I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.
26Ezk 36:31 Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.
26Ezk 36:32 It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
26Ezk 36:33 "Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:34 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.
26Ezk 36:35 And they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.'
26Ezk 36:36 Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.
26Ezk 36:37 "Thus says the Lord GOD: This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their people like a flock.
26Ezk 36:38 Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones.
26Ezk 37:2 And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
26Ezk 37:3 And he said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, you know."
26Ezk 37:4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 37:5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.
26Ezk 37:6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
26Ezk 37:8 And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them.
26Ezk 37:9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live."
26Ezk 37:10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
26Ezk 37:11 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.'
26Ezk 37:12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel.
26Ezk 37:13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.
26Ezk 37:14 And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD."
26Ezk 37:15 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 37:16 "Son of man, take a stick and write on it, 'For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him'; then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.'
26Ezk 37:17 And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
26Ezk 37:18 And when your people say to you, 'Will you not tell us what you mean by these?'
26Ezk 37:19 say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand.
26Ezk 37:20 When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes,
26Ezk 37:21 then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land.
26Ezk 37:22 And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms.
26Ezk 37:23 They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
26Ezk 37:24 "My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes.
26Ezk 37:25 They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children's children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever.
26Ezk 37:26 I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
26Ezk 37:27 My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
26Ezk 37:28 Then the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore."
26Ezk 38:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 38:2 "Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him
26Ezk 38:3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
26Ezk 38:4 And I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great host, all of them with buckler and shield, wielding swords.
26Ezk 38:5 Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
26Ezk 38:6 Gomer and all his hordes; Beth-togarmah from the uttermost parts of the north with all his hordes--many peoples are with you.
26Ezk 38:7 "Be ready and keep ready, you and all your hosts that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.
26Ezk 38:8 After many days you will be mustered. In the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them.
26Ezk 38:9 You will advance, coming on like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.
26Ezk 38:10 "Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day, thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme
26Ezk 38:11 and say, 'I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,'
26Ezk 38:12 to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth.
26Ezk 38:13 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, 'Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?'
26Ezk 38:14 "Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know it?
26Ezk 38:15 You will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army.
26Ezk 38:16 You will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
26Ezk 38:17 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?
26Ezk 38:18 But on that day, the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, my wrath will be roused in my anger.
26Ezk 38:19 For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
26Ezk 38:20 The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the people who are on the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground.
26Ezk 38:21 I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Every man's sword will be against his brother.
26Ezk 38:22 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur.
26Ezk 38:23 So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:1 "And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
26Ezk 39:2 And I will turn you about and drive you forward, and bring you up from the uttermost parts of the north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 39:3 Then I will strike your bow from your left hand, and will make your arrows drop out of your right hand.
26Ezk 39:4 You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your hordes and the peoples who are with you. I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
26Ezk 39:5 You shall fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:6 I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands, and they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:7 "And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
26Ezk 39:8 Behold, it is coming and it will be brought about, declares the Lord GOD. That is the day of which I have spoken.
26Ezk 39:9 "Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and make fires of the weapons and burn them, shields and bucklers, bow and arrows, clubs and spears; and they will make fires of them for seven years,
26Ezk 39:10 so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests, for they will make their fires of the weapons. They will seize the spoil of those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:11 "On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried. It will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:12 For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:13 All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that I show my glory, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:14 They will set apart men to travel through the land regularly and bury those travelers remaining on the face of the land, so as to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make their search.
26Ezk 39:15 And when these travel through the land and anyone sees a human bone, then he shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:16 (Hamonah is also the name of the city.) Thus shall they cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:17 "As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: Speak to the birds of every sort and to all beasts of the field, 'Assemble and come, gather from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.
26Ezk 39:18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth--of rams, of lambs, and of he-goats, of bulls, all of them fat beasts of Bashan.
26Ezk 39:19 And you shall eat fat till you are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you.
26Ezk 39:20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors,' declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:21 "And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.
26Ezk 39:22 The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.
26Ezk 39:23 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they dealt so treacherously with me that I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
26Ezk 39:24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.
26Ezk 39:25 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name.
26Ezk 39:26 They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid,
26Ezk 39:27 when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations.
26Ezk 39:28 Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore.
26Ezk 39:29 And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city.
26Ezk 40:2 In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
26Ezk 40:3 When he brought me there, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
26Ezk 40:4 And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 40:5 And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
26Ezk 40:6 Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep.
26Ezk 40:7 And the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
26Ezk 40:8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, on the inside, one reed.
26Ezk 40:9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
26Ezk 40:10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
26Ezk 40:11 Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
26Ezk 40:12 There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side. And the side rooms were six cubits on either side.
26Ezk 40:13 Then he measured the gate from the ceiling of the one side room to the ceiling of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other.
26Ezk 40:14 He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court.
26Ezk 40:15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
26Ezk 40:16 And the gateway had windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were palm trees.
26Ezk 40:17 Then he brought me into the outer court. And behold, there were chambers and a pavement, all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
26Ezk 40:18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
26Ezk 40:19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side.
26Ezk 40:20 As for the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.
26Ezk 40:21 Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:22 And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. And by seven steps people would go up to it, and find its vestibule before them.
26Ezk 40:23 And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
26Ezk 40:24 And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
26Ezk 40:25 Both it and its vestibule had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:26 And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was before them, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side.
26Ezk 40:27 And there was a gate on the south of the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
26Ezk 40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate. It was of the same size as the others.
26Ezk 40:29 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:30 And there were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
26Ezk 40:31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate. It was of the same size as the others.
26Ezk 40:33 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:34 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it. It had the same size as the others.
26Ezk 40:36 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and it had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:37 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:38 There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.
26Ezk 40:39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
26Ezk 40:40 And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
26Ezk 40:41 Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, on which to slaughter.
26Ezk 40:42 And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
26Ezk 40:43 And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
26Ezk 40:44 On the outside of the inner gateway there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north.
26Ezk 40:45 And he said to me, This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
26Ezk 40:46 and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him.
26Ezk 40:47 And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, a square. And the altar was in front of the temple.
26Ezk 40:48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.
26Ezk 40:49 The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps. And there were pillars beside the jambs, one on either side.
26Ezk 41:1 Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs. On each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs.
26Ezk 41:2 And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits.
26Ezk 41:3 Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side of the entrance, seven cubits.
26Ezk 41:4 And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across the nave. And he said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."
26Ezk 41:5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple.
26Ezk 41:6 And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.
26Ezk 41:7 And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.
26Ezk 41:8 I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits.
26Ezk 41:9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the
26Ezk 41:10 other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
26Ezk 41:11 And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.
26Ezk 41:12 The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
26Ezk 41:13 Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;
26Ezk 41:14 also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.
26Ezk 41:15 Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back and its galleries on either side, a hundred cubits. The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court,
26Ezk 41:16 the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
26Ezk 41:17 to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern.
26Ezk 41:18 It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces:
26Ezk 41:19 a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around.
26Ezk 41:20 From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave.
26Ezk 41:21 The doorposts of the nave were squared, and in front of the Holy Place was something resembling
26Ezk 41:22 an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."
26Ezk 41:23 The nave and the Holy Place had each a double door.
26Ezk 41:24 The double doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door.
26Ezk 41:25 And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside.
26Ezk 41:26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies.
26Ezk 42:1 Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the separate yard and opposite the building on the north.
26Ezk 42:2 The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits.
26Ezk 42:3 Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
26Ezk 42:4 And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north.
26Ezk 42:5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
26Ezk 42:6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
26Ezk 42:7 And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long.
26Ezk 42:8 For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave were a hundred cubits long.
26Ezk 42:9 Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.
26Ezk 42:10 In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers
26Ezk 42:11 with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors,
26Ezk 42:12 as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.
26Ezk 42:13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering--for the place is holy.
26Ezk 42:14 When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people."
26Ezk 42:15 Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.
26Ezk 42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
26Ezk 42:17 He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
26Ezk 42:18 He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.
26Ezk 43:1 Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east.
26Ezk 43:2 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
26Ezk 43:3 And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face.
26Ezk 43:4 As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east,
26Ezk 43:5 the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
26Ezk 43:6 While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,
26Ezk 43:7 and he said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places,
26Ezk 43:8 by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.
26Ezk 43:9 Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.
26Ezk 43:10 "As for you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan.
26Ezk 43:11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out.
26Ezk 43:12 This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
26Ezk 43:13 "These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:
26Ezk 43:14 from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;
26Ezk 43:15 and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns.
26Ezk 43:16 The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad.
26Ezk 43:17 The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around. The steps of the altar shall face east."
26Ezk 43:18 And he said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and for throwing blood against it,
26Ezk 43:19 you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, a bull from the herd for a sin offering.
26Ezk 43:20 And you shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and upon the rim all around. Thus you shall purify the altar and make atonement for it.
26Ezk 43:21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.
26Ezk 43:22 And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull.
26Ezk 43:23 When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.
26Ezk 43:24 You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
26Ezk 43:25 For seven days you shall provide daily a male goat for a sin offering; also, a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.
26Ezk 43:26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it.
26Ezk 43:27 And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, and I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 44:1 Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east. And it was shut.
26Ezk 44:2 And the LORD said to me, "This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it. Therefore it shall remain shut.
26Ezk 44:3 Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. He shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by the same way."
26Ezk 44:4 Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD. And I fell on my face.
26Ezk 44:5 And the LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I shall tell you concerning all the statutes of the temple of the LORD and all its laws. And mark well the entrance to the temple and all the exits from the sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:6 And say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: O house of Israel, enough of all your abominations,
26Ezk 44:7 in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning my temple, when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant, in addition to all your abominations.
26Ezk 44:8 And you have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have set others to keep my charge for you in my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:9 "Thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, shall enter my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:10 But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment.
26Ezk 44:11 They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple and ministering in the temple. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before the people, to minister to them.
26Ezk 44:12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, declares the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their punishment.
26Ezk 44:13 They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any of my holy things and the things that are most holy, but they shall bear their shame and the abominations that they have committed.
26Ezk 44:14 Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its service and all that is to be done in it.
26Ezk 44:15 "But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me. And they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 44:16 They shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
26Ezk 44:17 When they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen garments. They shall have nothing of wool on them, while they minister at the gates of the inner court, and within.
26Ezk 44:18 They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and linen undergarments around their waists. They shall not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat.
26Ezk 44:19 And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off the garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other garments, lest they transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
26Ezk 44:20 They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall surely trim the hair of their heads.
26Ezk 44:21 No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.
26Ezk 44:22 They shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but only virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
26Ezk 44:23 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
26Ezk 44:24 In a dispute, they shall act as judges, and they shall judge it according to my judgments. They shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall keep my Sabbaths holy.
26Ezk 44:25 They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person. However, for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister they may defile themselves.
26Ezk 44:26 After he has become clean, they shall count seven days for him.
26Ezk 44:27 And on the day that he goes into the Holy Place, into the inner court, to minister in the Holy Place, he shall offer his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 44:28 "This shall be their inheritance: I am their inheritance: and you shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
26Ezk 44:29 They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
26Ezk 44:30 And the first of all the firstfruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests. You shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, that a blessing may rest on your house.
26Ezk 44:31 The priests shall not eat of anything, whether bird or beast, that has died of itself or is torn by wild animals.
26Ezk 45:1 "When you allot the land as an inheritance, you shall set apart for the LORD a portion of the land as a holy district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits broad. It shall be holy throughout its whole extent.
26Ezk 45:2 Of this a square plot of 500 by 500 cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it.
26Ezk 45:3 And from this measured district you shall measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 broad, in which shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
26Ezk 45:4 It shall be the holy portion of the land. It shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:5 Another section, 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits broad, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their possession for cities to live in.
26Ezk 45:6 "Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign for the property of the city an area 5,000 cubits broad and 25,000 cubits long. It shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:7 "And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district and the property of the city, alongside the holy district and the property of the city, on the west and on the east, corresponding in length to one of the tribal portions, and extending from the western to the eastern boundary
26Ezk 45:8 of the land. It is to be his property in Israel. And my princes shall no more oppress my people, but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes.
26Ezk 45:9 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression, and execute justice and righteousness. Cease your evictions of my people, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 45:10 "You shall have just balances, a just ephah, and a just bath.
26Ezk 45:11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, the bath containing one tenth of a homer, and the ephah one tenth of a homer; the homer shall be the standard measure.
26Ezk 45:12 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your mina.
26Ezk 45:13 "This is the offering that you shall make: one sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and one sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley,
26Ezk 45:14 and as the fixed portion of oil, measured in baths, one tenth of a bath from each cor (the cor, like the homer, contains ten baths).
26Ezk 45:15 And one sheep from every flock of two hundred, from the watering places of Israel for grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 45:16 All the people of the land shall be obliged to give this offering to the prince in Israel.
26Ezk 45:17 It shall be the prince's duty to furnish the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the new moons, and the Sabbaths, all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement on behalf of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:18 "Thus says the Lord GOD: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a bull from the herd without blemish, and purify the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and the posts of the gate of the inner court.
26Ezk 45:20 You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the temple.
26Ezk 45:21 "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall celebrate the Feast of the Passover, and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.
26Ezk 45:22 On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a young bull for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:23 And on the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish, on each of the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:24 And he shall provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 45:25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven days of the feast, he shall make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, and grain offerings, and for the oil.
26Ezk 46:1 "Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
26Ezk 46:2 The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from outside, and shall take his stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
26Ezk 46:3 The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
26Ezk 46:4 The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish.
26Ezk 46:5 And the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 46:6 On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish.
26Ezk 46:7 As a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 46:8 When the prince enters, he shall enter by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
26Ezk 46:9 "When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.
26Ezk 46:10 When they enter, the prince shall enter with them, and when they go out, he shall go out.
26Ezk 46:11 "At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.
26Ezk 46:12 When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.
26Ezk 46:13 "You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
26Ezk 46:14 And you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a grain offering to the LORD. This is a perpetual statute.
26Ezk 46:15 Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a regular burnt offering.
26Ezk 46:16 "Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance.
26Ezk 46:17 But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty. Then it shall revert to the prince; surely it is his inheritance--it shall belong to his sons.
26Ezk 46:18 The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property."
26Ezk 46:19 Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests, and behold, a place was there at the extreme western end of them.
26Ezk 46:20 And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so transmit holiness to the people."
26Ezk 46:21 Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court. And behold, in each corner of the court there was another court--
26Ezk 46:22 in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size.
26Ezk 46:23 On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around.
26Ezk 46:24 Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
26Ezk 47:1 Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.
26Ezk 47:2 Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.
26Ezk 47:3 Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep.
26Ezk 47:4 Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep.
26Ezk 47:5 Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
26Ezk 47:6 And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
26Ezk 47:7 As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other.
26Ezk 47:8 And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh.
26Ezk 47:9 And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
26Ezk 47:10 Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.
26Ezk 47:11 But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
26Ezk 47:12 And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."
26Ezk 47:13 Thus says the Lord GOD: "This is the boundary by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
26Ezk 47:14 And you shall divide equally what I swore to give to your fathers. This land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
26Ezk 47:15 "This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to Zedad,
26Ezk 47:16 Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26Ezk 47:17 So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enan, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side.
26Ezk 47:18 "On the east side, the boundary shall run between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.
26Ezk 47:19 "On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah-kadesh, from there along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.
26Ezk 47:20 "On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This shall be the west side.
26Ezk 47:21 "So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:22 You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the sojourners who reside among you and have had children among you. They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel. With you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:23 In whatever tribe the sojourner resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 48:1 "These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern extreme, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan (which is on the northern border of Damascus over against Hamath), and extending from the east side to the west, Dan, one portion.
26Ezk 48:2 Adjoining the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher, one portion.
26Ezk 48:3 Adjoining the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, Naphtali, one portion.
26Ezk 48:4 Adjoining the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, Manasseh, one portion.
26Ezk 48:5 Adjoining the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, Ephraim, one portion.
26Ezk 48:6 Adjoining the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, Reuben, one portion.
26Ezk 48:7 Adjoining the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, Judah, one portion.
26Ezk 48:8 "Adjoining the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the portion which you shall set apart, 25,000 cubits in breadth, and in length equal to one of the tribal portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the midst of it.
26Ezk 48:9 The portion that you shall set apart for the LORD shall be 25,000 cubits in length, and 20,000 in breadth.
26Ezk 48:10 These shall be the allotments of the holy portion: the priests shall have an allotment measuring 25,000 cubits on the northern side, 10,000 cubits in breadth on the western side, 10,000 in breadth on the eastern side, and 25,000 in length on the southern side, with the sanctuary of the LORD in the midst of it.
26Ezk 48:11 This shall be for the consecrated priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept my charge, who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.
26Ezk 48:12 And it shall belong to them as a special portion from the holy portion of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the territory of the Levites.
26Ezk 48:13 And alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an allotment 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 in breadth. The whole length shall be 25,000 cubits and the breadth 20,000.
26Ezk 48:14 They shall not sell or exchange any of it. They shall not alienate this choice portion of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.
26Ezk 48:15 "The remainder, 5,000 cubits in breadth and 25,000 in length, shall be for common use for the city, for dwellings and for open country. In the midst of it shall be the city,
26Ezk 48:16 and these shall be its measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500, the east side 4,500, and the west side 4,500.
26Ezk 48:17 And the city shall have open land: on the north 250 cubits, on the south 250, on the east 250, and on the west 250.
26Ezk 48:18 The remainder of the length alongside the holy portion shall be 10,000 cubits to the east, and 10,000 to the west, and it shall be alongside the holy portion. Its produce shall be food for the workers of the city.
26Ezk 48:19 And the workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.
26Ezk 48:20 The whole portion that you shall set apart shall be 25,000 cubits square, that is, the holy portion together with the property of the city.
26Ezk 48:21 "What remains on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city shall belong to the prince. Extending from the 25,000 cubits of the holy portion to the east border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the west border, parallel to the tribal portions, it shall belong to the prince. The holy portion with the sanctuary of the temple shall be in its midst.
26Ezk 48:22 It shall be separate from the property of the Levites and the property of the city, which are in the midst of that which belongs to the prince. The portion of the prince shall lie between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin.
26Ezk 48:23 "As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, Benjamin, one portion.
26Ezk 48:24 Adjoining the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon, one portion.
26Ezk 48:25 Adjoining the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar, one portion.
26Ezk 48:26 Adjoining the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun, one portion.
26Ezk 48:27 Adjoining the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad, one portion.
26Ezk 48:28 And adjoining the territory of Gad to the south, the boundary shall run from Tamar to the waters of Meribah-kadesh, from there along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea.
26Ezk 48:29 This is the land that you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, declares the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 48:30 "These shall be the exits of the city: On the north side, which is to be 4,500 cubits by measure,
26Ezk 48:31 three gates, the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi, the gates of the city being named after the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 48:32 On the east side, which is to be 4,500 cubits, three gates, the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan.

26Ezk 48:34 On the west side, which is to be 4,500 cubits, three gates, the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher, and the gate of Naphtali.
26Ezk 48:35 The circumference of the city shall be 18,000 cubits. And the name of the city from that time on shall be, The LORD Is There."

27Dn 1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
27Dn 1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.
27Dn 1:3 Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility,
27Dn 1:4 youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
27Dn 1:5 The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king.
27Dn 1:6 Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah.
27Dn 1:7 And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.
27Dn 1:8 But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself.
27Dn 1:9 And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,
27Dn 1:10 and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king."
27Dn 1:11 Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
27Dn 1:12 "Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27Dn 1:13 Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see."
27Dn 1:14 So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.
27Dn 1:15 At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's food.
27Dn 1:16 So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
27Dn 1:17 As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
27Dn 1:18 At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 1:19 And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king.
27Dn 1:20 And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.
27Dn 1:21 And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.
27Dn 2:1 In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.
27Dn 2:2 Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
27Dn 2:3 And the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream."
27Dn 2:4 Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
27Dn 2:5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins.
27Dn 2:6 But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation."
27Dn 2:7 They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation."
27Dn 2:8 The king answered and said, "I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm--
27Dn 2:9 if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation."
27Dn 2:10 The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.
27Dn 2:11 The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
27Dn 2:12 Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
27Dn 2:13 So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them.
27Dn 2:14 Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:15 He declared to Arioch, the king's captain, "Why is the decree of the king so urgent?" Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.
27Dn 2:16 And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,
27Dn 2:18 and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
27Dn 2:20 Daniel answered and said: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.
27Dn 2:21 He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding;
27Dn 2:22 he reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.
27Dn 2:23 To you, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we asked of you, for you have made known to us the king's matter."
27Dn 2:24 Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation."
27Dn 2:25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation."
27Dn 2:26 The king declared to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"
27Dn 2:27 Daniel answered the king and said, "No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked,
27Dn 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:
27Dn 2:29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.
27Dn 2:30 But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.
27Dn 2:31 "You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.
27Dn 2:32 The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,
27Dn 2:33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
27Dn 2:34 As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.
27Dn 2:35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
27Dn 2:36 "This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.
27Dn 2:37 You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,
27Dn 2:38 and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all--you are the head of gold.
27Dn 2:39 Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
27Dn 2:40 And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these.
27Dn 2:41 And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.
27Dn 2:42 And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
27Dn 2:43 As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.
27Dn 2:44 And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever,
27Dn 2:45 just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him.
27Dn 2:47 The king answered and said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery."
27Dn 2:48 Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:49 Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court.
27Dn 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 3:2 Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:3 Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:4 And the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
27Dn 3:5 that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27Dn 3:6 And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace."
27Dn 3:7 Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:8 Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.
27Dn 3:9 They declared to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!
27Dn 3:10 You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.
27Dn 3:11 And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.
27Dn 3:12 There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."
27Dn 3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king.
27Dn 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?
27Dn 3:15 Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
27Dn 3:17 If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
27Dn 3:18 But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."
27Dn 3:19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated.
27Dn 3:20 And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
27Dn 3:21 Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
27Dn 3:22 Because the king's order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
27Dn 3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.
27Dn 3:24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?" They answered and said to the king, "True, O king."
27Dn 3:25 He answered and said, "But I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods."
27Dn 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.
27Dn 3:27 And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.
27Dn 3:28 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.
27Dn 3:29 Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way."
27Dn 3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 4:1  King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!
27Dn 4:2 It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.
27Dn 4:3 How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:4  I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace.
27Dn 4:5 I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me.
27Dn 4:6 So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
27Dn 4:7 Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation.
27Dn 4:8 At last Daniel came in before me--he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods--and I told him the dream, saying,
27Dn 4:9 "O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation.
27Dn 4:10 The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
27Dn 4:11 The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth.
27Dn 4:12 Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
27Dn 4:13 "I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.
27Dn 4:14 He proclaimed aloud and said thus: 'Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
27Dn 4:15 But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
27Dn 4:16 Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him.
27Dn 4:17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.'
27Dn 4:18 This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
27Dn 4:19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a while, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered and said, "Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you." Belteshazzar answered and said, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!
27Dn 4:20 The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth,
27Dn 4:21 whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived--
27Dn 4:22 it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:23 And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,'
27Dn 4:24 this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,
27Dn 4:25 that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.
27Dn 4:26 And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules.
27Dn 4:27 Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity."
27Dn 4:28 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 4:29 At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
27Dn 4:30 and the king answered and said, "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?"
27Dn 4:31 While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, "O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,
27Dn 4:32 and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will."
27Dn 4:33 Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws.
27Dn 4:34 At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;
27Dn 4:35 all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, "What have you done?"
27Dn 4:36 At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.
27Dn 4:37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
27Dn 5:1 King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.
27Dn 5:2 Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
27Dn 5:3 Then they brought in the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
27Dn 5:4 They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27Dn 5:5 Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw the hand as it wrote.
27Dn 5:6 Then the king's color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together.
27Dn 5:7 The king called loudly to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king declared to the wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:8 Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation.
27Dn 5:9 Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed, and his lords were perplexed.
27Dn 5:10 The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, "O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change.
27Dn 5:11 There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father--your father the king--made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,
27Dn 5:12 because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."
27Dn 5:13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, "You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah.
27Dn 5:14 I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.
27Dn 5:15 Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter.
27Dn 5:16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.
27Dn 5:18 O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty.
27Dn 5:19 And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled.
27Dn 5:20 But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.
27Dn 5:21 He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will.
27Dn 5:22 And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,
27Dn 5:23 but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.
27Dn 5:24 "Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed.
27Dn 5:25 And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN.
27Dn 5:26 This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;
27Dn 5:27 TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting;
27Dn 5:28 PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."
27Dn 5:29 Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
27Dn 5:30 That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed.
27Dn 5:31  And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
27Dn 6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;
27Dn 6:2 and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.
27Dn 6:3 Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
27Dn 6:4 Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.
27Dn 6:5 Then these men said, "We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God."
27Dn 6:6 Then these presidents and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever!
27Dn 6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
27Dn 6:8 Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked."
27Dn 6:9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.
27Dn 6:10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
27Dn 6:11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.
27Dn 6:12 Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, "O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?" The king answered and said, "The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked."
27Dn 6:13 Then they answered and said before the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."
27Dn 6:14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.
27Dn 6:15 Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed."
27Dn 6:16 Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!"
27Dn 6:17 And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
27Dn 6:18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.
27Dn 6:19 Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.
27Dn 6:20 As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?"
27Dn 6:21 Then Daniel said to the king, "O king, live forever!
27Dn 6:22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm."
27Dn 6:23 Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
27Dn 6:24 And the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions--they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
27Dn 6:25 Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: "Peace be multiplied to you.
27Dn 6:26 I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.
27Dn 6:27 He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."
27Dn 6:28 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27Dn 7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter.
27Dn 7:2 Daniel declared, "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
27Dn 7:3 And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.
27Dn 7:4 The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.
27Dn 7:5 And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'
27Dn 7:6 After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
27Dn 7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
27Dn 7:8 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
27Dn 7:9 "As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire.
27Dn 7:10 A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
27Dn 7:11 "I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.
27Dn 7:12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
27Dn 7:13 "I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.
27Dn 7:14 And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.
27Dn 7:15 "As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me.
27Dn 7:16 I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
27Dn 7:17 'These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
27Dn 7:18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.'
27Dn 7:19 "Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet,
27Dn 7:20 and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions.
27Dn 7:21 As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them,
27Dn 7:22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.
27Dn 7:23 "Thus he said: 'As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
27Dn 7:24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.
27Dn 7:25 He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
27Dn 7:26 But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
27Dn 7:27 And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'
27Dn 7:28 "Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart."
27Dn 8:1 In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
27Dn 8:2 And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal.
27Dn 8:3 I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
27Dn 8:4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.
27Dn 8:5 As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
27Dn 8:6 He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath.
27Dn 8:7 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
27Dn 8:8 Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.
27Dn 8:9 Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
27Dn 8:10 It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them.
27Dn 8:11 It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
27Dn 8:12 And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper.
27Dn 8:13 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, "For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?"
27Dn 8:14 And he said to me, "For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state."
27Dn 8:15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.
27Dn 8:16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."
27Dn 8:17 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."
27Dn 8:18 And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.
27Dn 8:19 He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end.
27Dn 8:20 As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.
27Dn 8:21 And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
27Dn 8:22 As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.
27Dn 8:23 And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise.
27Dn 8:24 His power shall be great--but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints.
27Dn 8:25 By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken--but by no human hand.
27Dn 8:26 The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now."
27Dn 8:27 And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.
27Dn 9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans--
27Dn 9:2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.
27Dn 9:3 Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
27Dn 9:5 we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules.
27Dn 9:6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
27Dn 9:7 To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you.
27Dn 9:8 To us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.
27Dn 9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him
27Dn 9:10 and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
27Dn 9:11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. And the curse and oath that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him.
27Dn 9:12 He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem.
27Dn 9:13 As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth.
27Dn 9:14 Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and we have not obeyed his voice.
27Dn 9:15 And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
27Dn 9:16 "O Lord, according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all who are around us.
27Dn 9:17 Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate.
27Dn 9:18 O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.
27Dn 9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name."
27Dn 9:20 While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God,
27Dn 9:21 while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice.
27Dn 9:22 He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, "O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding.
27Dn 9:23 At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.
27Dn 9:24 "Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.
27Dn 9:25 Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time.
27Dn 9:26 And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.
27Dn 9:27 And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator."
27Dn 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.
27Dn 10:2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks.
27Dn 10:3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks.
27Dn 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)
27Dn 10:5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
27Dn 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
27Dn 10:7 And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
27Dn 10:8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength.
27Dn 10:9 Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.
27Dn 10:10 And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
27Dn 10:11 And he said to me, "O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
27Dn 10:12 Then he said to me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.
27Dn 10:13 The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia,
27Dn 10:14 and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come."
27Dn 10:15 When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute.
27Dn 10:16 And behold, one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, "O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength.
27Dn 10:17 How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me."
27Dn 10:18 Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me.
27Dn 10:19 And he said, "O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage." And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
27Dn 10:20 Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come.
27Dn 10:21 But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.
27Dn 11:1 "And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
27Dn 11:2 "And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them. And when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.
27Dn 11:3 Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do as he wills.
27Dn 11:4 And as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the authority with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.
27Dn 11:5 "Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and shall rule, and his authority shall be a great authority.
27Dn 11:6 After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his arm shall not endure, but she shall be given up, and her attendants, he who fathered her, and he who supported her in those times.
27Dn 11:7 "And from a branch from her roots one shall arise in his place. He shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall prevail.
27Dn 11:8 He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold, and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north.
27Dn 11:9 Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return to his own land.
27Dn 11:10 "His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall keep coming and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress.
27Dn 11:11 Then the king of the south, moved with rage, shall come out and fight against the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand.
27Dn 11:12 And when the multitude is taken away, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
27Dn 11:13 For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the first. And after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.
27Dn 11:14 "In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail.
27Dn 11:15 Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his best troops, for there shall be no strength to stand.
27Dn 11:16 But he who comes against him shall do as he wills, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand.
27Dn 11:17 He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of an agreement and perform them. He shall give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom, but it shall not stand or be to his advantage.
27Dn 11:18 Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many of them, but a commander shall put an end to his insolence. Indeed, he shall turn his insolence back upon him.
27Dn 11:19 Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
27Dn 11:20 "Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute for the glory of the kingdom. But within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle.
27Dn 11:21 In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given. He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
27Dn 11:22 Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, even the prince of the covenant.
27Dn 11:23 And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully, and he shall become strong with a small people.
27Dn 11:24 Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province, and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers' fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time.
27Dn 11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him.
27Dn 11:26 Even those who eat his food shall break him. His army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain.
27Dn 11:27 And as for the two kings, their hearts shall be bent on doing evil. They shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail, for the end is yet to be at the time appointed.
27Dn 11:28 And he shall return to his land with great wealth, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will and return to his own land.
27Dn 11:29 "At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south, but it shall not be this time as it was before.
27Dn 11:30 For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant.
27Dn 11:31 Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the regular burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.
27Dn 11:32 He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant, but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action.
27Dn 11:33 And the wise among the people shall make many understand, though for some days they shall stumble by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder.
27Dn 11:34 When they stumble, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery,
27Dn 11:35 and some of the wise shall stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time.
27Dn 11:36 "And the king shall do as he wills. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper till the indignation is accomplished; for what is decreed shall be done.
27Dn 11:37 He shall pay no attention to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women. He shall not pay attention to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all.
27Dn 11:38 He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these. A god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
27Dn 11:39 He shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall load with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.
27Dn 11:40 "At the time of the end, the king of the south shall attack him, but the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships. And he shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through.
27Dn 11:41 He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites.
27Dn 11:42 He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
27Dn 11:43 He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Cushites shall follow in his train.
27Dn 11:44 But news from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go out with great fury to destroy and devote many to destruction.
27Dn 11:45 And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.
27Dn 12:1 "At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.
27Dn 12:2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
27Dn 12:3 And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
27Dn 12:4 But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
27Dn 12:5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream.
27Dn 12:6 And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, "How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?"
27Dn 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished.
27Dn 12:8 I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, "O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?"
27Dn 12:9 He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.
27Dn 12:10 Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.
27Dn 12:11 And from the time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days.
27Dn 12:12 Blessed is he who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days.
27Dn 12:13 But go your way till the end. And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days."

28Hs 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
28Hs 1:2 When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, "Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD."
28Hs 1:3 So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
28Hs 1:4 And the LORD said to him, "Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
28Hs 1:5 And on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel."
28Hs 1:6 She conceived again and bore a daughter. And the LORD said to him, "Call her name No Mercy, for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, to forgive them at all.
28Hs 1:7 But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God. I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen."
28Hs 1:8 When she had weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son.
28Hs 1:9 And the LORD said, "Call his name Not My People, for you are not my people, and I am not your God."
28Hs 1:10  Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. And in the place where it was said to them, "You are not my people," it shall be said to them, "Children of the living God."
28Hs 1:11 And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
28Hs 2:1  Say to your brothers, "You are my people," and to your sisters, "You have received mercy."
28Hs 2:2 "Plead with your mother, plead-- for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband-- that she put away her whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts;
28Hs 2:3 lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and make her like a parched land, and kill her with thirst.
28Hs 2:4 Upon her children also I will have no mercy, because they are children of whoredom.
28Hs 2:5 For their mother has played the whore; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'
28Hs 2:6 Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her paths.
28Hs 2:7 She shall pursue her lovers but not overtake them, and she shall seek them but shall not find them. Then she shall say, 'I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now.'
28Hs 2:8 And she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished on her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
28Hs 2:9 Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness.
28Hs 2:10 Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.
28Hs 2:11 And I will put an end to all her mirth, her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.
28Hs 2:12 And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, 'These are my wages, which my lovers have given me.' I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
28Hs 2:13 And I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals when she burned offerings to them and adorned herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers and forgot me, declares the LORD.
28Hs 2:14 "Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
28Hs 2:15 And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.
28Hs 2:16 "And in that day, declares the LORD, you will call me 'My Husband,' and no longer will you call me 'My Baal.'
28Hs 2:17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more.
28Hs 2:18 And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety.
28Hs 2:19 And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy.
28Hs 2:20 I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD.
28Hs 2:21 "And in that day I will answer, declares the LORD, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,
28Hs 2:22 and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel,
28Hs 2:23 and I will sow her for myself in the land. And I will have mercy on No Mercy, and I will say to Not My People, 'You are my people'; and he shall say, 'You are my God.'"
28Hs 3:1 And the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins."
28Hs 3:2 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley.
28Hs 3:3 And I said to her, "You must dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you."
28Hs 3:4 For the children of Israel shall dwell many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or household gods.
28Hs 3:5 Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God, and David their king, and they shall come in fear to the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days.
28Hs 4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel, for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, and no knowledge of God in the land;
28Hs 4:2 there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28Hs 4:3 Therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish, and also the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, and even the fish of the sea are taken away.
28Hs 4:4 Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest.
28Hs 4:5 You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night; and I will destroy your mother.
28Hs 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
28Hs 4:7 The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change their glory into shame.
28Hs 4:8 They feed on the sin of my people; they are greedy for their iniquity.
28Hs 4:9 And it shall be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
28Hs 4:10 They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall play the whore, but not multiply, because they have forsaken the LORD to cherish
28Hs 4:11 whoredom, wine, and new wine, which take away the understanding.
28Hs 4:12 My people inquire of a piece of wood, and their walking staff gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have left their God to play the whore.
28Hs 4:13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and your brides commit adultery.
28Hs 4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go aside with prostitutes and sacrifice with cult prostitutes, and a people without understanding shall come to ruin.
28Hs 4:15 Though you play the whore, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. Enter not into Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, and swear not, "As the LORD lives."
28Hs 4:16 Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn; can the LORD now feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture?
28Hs 4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone.
28Hs 4:18 When their drink is gone, they give themselves to whoring; their rulers dearly love shame.
28Hs 4:19 A wind has wrapped them in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
28Hs 5:1 Hear this, O priests! Pay attention, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For the judgment is for you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor.
28Hs 5:2 And the revolters have gone deep into slaughter, but I will discipline all of them.
28Hs 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have played the whore; Israel is defiled.
28Hs 5:4 Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the LORD.
28Hs 5:5 The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in his guilt; Judah also shall stumble with them.
28Hs 5:6 With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them.
28Hs 5:7 They have dealt faithlessly with the LORD; for they have borne alien children. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.
28Hs 5:8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven; we follow you, O Benjamin!
28Hs 5:9 Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of punishment; among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.
28Hs 5:10 The princes of Judah have become like those who move the landmark; upon them I will pour out my wrath like water.
28Hs 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to go after filth.
28Hs 5:12 But I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like dry rot to the house of Judah.
28Hs 5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound.
28Hs 5:14 For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and no one shall rescue.
28Hs 5:15 I will return again to my place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face, and in their distress earnestly seek me.
28Hs 6:1 "Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up.
28Hs 6:2 After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him.
28Hs 6:3 Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD; his going out is sure as the dawn; he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth."
28Hs 6:4 What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away.
28Hs 6:5 Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light.
28Hs 6:6 For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
28Hs 6:7 But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.
28Hs 6:8 Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood.
28Hs 6:9 As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy.
28Hs 6:10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.
28Hs 6:11 For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore the fortunes of my people.
28Hs 7:1 When I would heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim is revealed, and the evil deeds of Samaria; for they deal falsely; the thief breaks in, and the bandits raid outside.
28Hs 7:2 But they do not consider that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds surround them; they are before my face.
28Hs 7:3 By their evil they make the king glad, and the princes by their treachery.
28Hs 7:4 They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven whose baker ceases to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
28Hs 7:5 On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.
28Hs 7:6 For with hearts like an oven they approach their intrigue; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
28Hs 7:7 All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen, and none of them calls upon me.
28Hs 7:8 Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
28Hs 7:9 Strangers devour his strength, and he knows it not; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not.
28Hs 7:10 The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him, for all this.
28Hs 7:11 Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria.
28Hs 7:12 As they go, I will spread over them my net; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens; I will discipline them according to the report made to their congregation.
28Hs 7:13 Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.
28Hs 7:14 They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; for grain and wine they gash themselves; they rebel against me.
28Hs 7:15 Although I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devise evil against me.
28Hs 7:16 They return, but not upward; they are like a treacherous bow; their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
28Hs 8:1 Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law.
28Hs 8:2 To me they cry, "My God, we--Israel--know you."
28Hs 8:3 Israel has spurned the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
28Hs 8:4 They made kings, but not through me. They set up princes, but I knew it not. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.
28Hs 8:5 I have spurned your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
28Hs 8:6 For it is from Israel; a craftsman made it; it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces.
28Hs 8:7 For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no flour; if it were to yield, strangers would devour it.
28Hs 8:8 Israel is swallowed up; already they are among the nations as a useless vessel.
28Hs 8:9 For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey wandering alone; Ephraim has hired lovers.
28Hs 8:10 Though they hire allies among the nations, I will soon gather them up. And the king and princes shall soon writhe because of the tribute.
28Hs 8:11 Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, they have become to him altars for sinning.
28Hs 8:12 Were I to write for him my laws by the ten thousands, they would be regarded as a strange thing.
28Hs 8:13 As for my sacrificial offerings, they sacrifice meat and eat it, but the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
28Hs 8:14 For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; so I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour her strongholds.
28Hs 9:1 Rejoice not, O Israel! Exult not like the peoples; for you have played the whore, forsaking your God. You have loved a prostitute's wages on all threshing floors.
28Hs 9:2 Threshing floor and wine vat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail them.
28Hs 9:3 They shall not remain in the land of the LORD, but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
28Hs 9:4 They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the LORD, and their sacrifices shall not please him. It shall be like mourners' bread to them; all who eat of it shall be defiled; for their bread shall be for their hunger only; it shall not come to the house of the LORD.
28Hs 9:5 What will you do on the day of the appointed festival, and on the day of the feast of the LORD?
28Hs 9:6 For behold, they are going away from destruction; but Egypt shall gather them; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.
28Hs 9:7 The days of punishment have come; the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool; the man of the spirit is mad, because of your great iniquity and great hatred.
28Hs 9:8 The prophet is the watchman of Ephraim with my God; yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.
28Hs 9:9 They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity; he will punish their sins.
28Hs 9:10 Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree in its first season, I saw your fathers. But they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to the thing of shame, and became detestable like the thing they loved.
28Hs 9:11 Ephraim's glory shall fly away like a bird-- no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!
28Hs 9:12 Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them till none is left. Woe to them when I depart from them!
28Hs 9:13 Ephraim, as I have seen, was like a young palm planted in a meadow; but Ephraim must lead his children out to slaughter.
28Hs 9:14 Give them, O LORD-- what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
28Hs 9:15 Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal; there I began to hate them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.
28Hs 9:16 Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, I will put their beloved children to death.
28Hs 9:17 My God will reject them because they have not listened to him; they shall be wanderers among the nations.
28Hs 10:1 Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit. The more his fruit increased, the more altars he built; as his country improved, he improved his pillars.
28Hs 10:2 Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and destroy their pillars.
28Hs 10:3 For now they will say: "We have no king, for we do not fear the LORD; and a king--what could he do for us?"
28Hs 10:4 They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
28Hs 10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the calf of Beth-aven. Its people mourn for it, and so do its idolatrous priests-- those who rejoiced over it and over its glory-- for it has departed from them.
28Hs 10:6 The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.
28Hs 10:7 Samaria's king shall perish like a twig on the face of the waters.
28Hs 10:8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, "Cover us," and to the hills, "Fall on us."
28Hs 10:9 From the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel; there they have continued. Shall not the war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah?
28Hs 10:10 When I please, I will discipline them, and nations shall be gathered against them when they are bound up for their double iniquity.
28Hs 10:11 Ephraim was a trained calf that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will put Ephraim to the yoke; Judah must plow; Jacob must harrow for himself.
28Hs 10:12 Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap steadfast love; break up your fallow ground, for it is the time to seek the LORD, that he may come and rain righteousness upon you.
28Hs 10:13 You have plowed iniquity; you have reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your warriors,
28Hs 10:14 therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle; mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
28Hs 10:15 Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great evil. At dawn the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.
28Hs 11:1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
28Hs 11:2 The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols.
28Hs 11:3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
28Hs 11:4 I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them.
28Hs 11:5 They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.
28Hs 11:6 The sword shall rage against their cities, consume the bars of their gates, and devour them because of their own counsels.
28Hs 11:7 My people are bent on turning away from me, and though they call out to the Most High, he shall not raise them up at all.
28Hs 11:8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender.
28Hs 11:9 I will not execute my burning anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.
28Hs 11:10 They shall go after the LORD; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west;
28Hs 11:11 they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria, and I will return them to their homes, declares the LORD.
28Hs 11:12  Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
28Hs 12:1 Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt.
28Hs 12:2 The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him according to his deeds.
28Hs 12:3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he strove with God.
28Hs 12:4 He strove with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought his favor. He met God at Bethel, and there God spoke with us--
28Hs 12:5 the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name:
28Hs 12:6 "So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God."
28Hs 12:7 A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress.
28Hs 12:8 Ephraim has said, "Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin."
28Hs 12:9 I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.
28Hs 12:10 I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables.
28Hs 12:11 If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing: in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field.
28Hs 12:12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep.
28Hs 12:13 By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.
28Hs 12:14 Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.
28Hs 13:1 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel, but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
28Hs 13:2 And now they sin more and more, and make for themselves metal images, idols skillfully made of their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of them, "Those who offer human sacrifice kiss calves!"
28Hs 13:3 Therefore they shall be like the morning mist or like the dew that goes early away, like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor or like smoke from a window.
28Hs 13:4 But I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior.
28Hs 13:5 It was I who knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought;
28Hs 13:6 but when they had grazed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was lifted up; therefore they forgot me.
28Hs 13:7 So I am to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
28Hs 13:8 I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs; I will tear open their breast, and there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild beast would rip them open.
28Hs 13:9 He destroys you, O Israel, for you are against me, against your helper.
28Hs 13:10 Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities? Where are all your rulers-- those of whom you said, "Give me a king and princes"?
28Hs 13:11 I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him away in my wrath.
28Hs 13:12 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is kept in store.
28Hs 13:13 The pangs of childbirth come for him, but he is an unwise son, for at the right time he does not present himself at the opening of the womb.
28Hs 13:14 Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from Death? O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes.
28Hs 13:15 Though he may flourish among his brothers, the east wind, the wind of the LORD, shall come, rising from the wilderness, and his fountain shall dry up; his spring shall be parched; it shall strip his treasury of every precious thing.
28Hs 13:16  Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword; their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.
28Hs 14:1 Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
28Hs 14:2 Take with you words and return to the LORD; say to him, "Take away all iniquity; accept what is good, and we will pay with bulls the vows of our lips.
28Hs 14:3 Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses; and we will say no more, 'Our God,' to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy."
28Hs 14:4 I will heal their apostasy; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them.
28Hs 14:5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily; he shall take root like the trees of Lebanon;
28Hs 14:6 his shoots shall spread out; his beauty shall be like the olive, and his fragrance like Lebanon.
28Hs 14:7 They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow; they shall flourish like the grain; they shall blossom like the vine; their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:8 O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an evergreen cypress; from me comes your fruit.
28Hs 14:9 Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them; for the ways of the LORD are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them.

29Jl 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:
29Jl 1:2 Hear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
29Jl 1:3 Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.
29Jl 1:4 What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.
29Jl 1:5 Awake, you drunkards, and weep, and wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
29Jl 1:6 For a nation has come up against my land, powerful and beyond number; its teeth are lions' teeth, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
29Jl 1:7 It has laid waste my vine and splintered my fig tree; it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down; their branches are made white.
29Jl 1:8 Lament like a virgin wearing sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth.
29Jl 1:9 The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, the ministers of the LORD.
29Jl 1:10 The fields are destroyed, the ground mourns, because the grain is destroyed, the wine dries up, the oil languishes.
29Jl 1:11 Be ashamed, O tillers of the soil; wail, O vinedressers, for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
29Jl 1:12 The vine dries up; the fig tree languishes. Pomegranate, palm, and apple, all the trees of the field are dried up, and gladness dries up from the children of man.
29Jl 1:13 Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Go in, pass the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! Because grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
29Jl 1:14 Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
29Jl 1:15 Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
29Jl 1:16 Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29Jl 1:17 The seed shrivels under the clods; the storehouses are desolate; the granaries are torn down because the grain has dried up.
29Jl 1:18 How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed because there is no pasture for them; even the flocks of sheep suffer.
29Jl 1:19 To you, O LORD, I call. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has burned all the trees of the field.
29Jl 1:20 Even the beasts of the field pant for you because the water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
29Jl 2:1 Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming; it is near,
29Jl 2:2 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations.
29Jl 2:3 Fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them.
29Jl 2:4 Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses they run.
29Jl 2:5 As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle.
29Jl 2:6 Before them peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale.
29Jl 2:7 Like warriors they charge; like soldiers they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths.
29Jl 2:8 They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted.
29Jl 2:9 They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief.
29Jl 2:10 The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
29Jl 2:11 The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it?
29Jl 2:12 "Yet even now," declares the LORD, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;
29Jl 2:13 and rend your hearts and not your garments." Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster.
29Jl 2:14 Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering for the LORD your God?
29Jl 2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion; consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly;
29Jl 2:16 gather the people. Consecrate the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber.
29Jl 2:17 Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep and say, "Spare your people, O LORD, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"
29Jl 2:18 Then the LORD became jealous for his land and had pity on his people.
29Jl 2:19 The LORD answered and said to his people, "Behold, I am sending to you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
29Jl 2:20 "I will remove the northerner far from you, and drive him into a parched and desolate land, his vanguard into the eastern sea, and his rear guard into the western sea; the stench and foul smell of him will rise, for he has done great things.
29Jl 2:21 "Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things!
29Jl 2:22 Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their full yield.
29Jl 2:23 "Be glad, O children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given the early rain for your vindication; he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the latter rain, as before.
29Jl 2:24 "The threshing floors shall be full of grain; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
29Jl 2:25 I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.
29Jl 2:26 "You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:27 You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else. And my people shall never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:28  "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
29Jl 2:29 Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit.
29Jl 2:30 "And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.
29Jl 2:31 The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
29Jl 2:32 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.
29Jl 3:1  "For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29Jl 3:2 I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land,
29Jl 3:3 and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it.
29Jl 3:4 "What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily.
29Jl 3:5 For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.
29Jl 3:6 You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border.
29Jl 3:7 Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head.
29Jl 3:8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the LORD has spoken."
29Jl 3:9 Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
29Jl 3:10 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, "I am a warrior."
29Jl 3:11 Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD.
29Jl 3:12 Let the nations stir themselves up and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
29Jl 3:13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great.
29Jl 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
29Jl 3:15 The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
29Jl 3:16 The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel.
29Jl 3:17 "So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
29Jl 3:18 "And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Valley of Shittim.
29Jl 3:19 "Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the people of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
29Jl 3:20 But Judah shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem to all generations.
29Jl 3:21 I will avenge their blood, blood I have not avenged, for the LORD dwells in Zion."

30Am 1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
30Am 1:2 And he said: "The LORD roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the top of Carmel withers."
30Am 1:3 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron.
30Am 1:4 So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.
30Am 1:5 I will break the gate-bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden; and the people of Syria shall go into exile to Kir," says the LORD.
30Am 1:6 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they carried into exile a whole people to deliver them up to Edom.
30Am 1:7 So I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour her strongholds.
30Am 1:8 I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish," says the Lord GOD.
30Am 1:9 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they delivered up a whole people to Edom, and did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.
30Am 1:10 So I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour her strongholds."
30Am 1:11 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because he pursued his brother with the sword and cast off all pity, and his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever.
30Am 1:12 So I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the strongholds of Bozrah."
30Am 1:13 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.
30Am 1:14 So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour her strongholds, with shouting on the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
30Am 1:15 and their king shall go into exile, he and his princes together," says the LORD.
30Am 2:1 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.
30Am 2:2 So I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth, and Moab shall die amid uproar, amid shouting and the sound of the trumpet;
30Am 2:3 I will cut off the ruler from its midst, and will kill all its princes with him," says the LORD.
30Am 2:4 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them astray, those after which their fathers walked.
30Am 2:5 So I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem."
30Am 2:6 Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals--
30Am 2:7 those who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and turn aside the way of the afflicted; a man and his father go in to the same girl, so that my holy name is profaned;
30Am 2:8 they lay themselves down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
30Am 2:9 "Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars and who was as strong as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath.
30Am 2:10 Also it was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
30Am 2:11 And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?" declares the LORD.
30Am 2:12 "But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, saying, 'You shall not prophesy.'
30Am 2:13 "Behold, I will press you down in your place, as a cart full of sheaves presses down.
30Am 2:14 Flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not retain his strength, nor shall the mighty save his life;
30Am 2:15 he who handles the bow shall not stand, and he who is swift of foot shall not save himself, nor shall he who rides the horse save his life;
30Am 2:16 and he who is stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day," declares the LORD.
30Am 3:1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
30Am 3:2 "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
30Am 3:3 "Do two walk together, unless they have agreed to meet?
30Am 3:4 Does a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from his den, if he has taken nothing?
30Am 3:5 Does a bird fall in a snare on the earth, when there is no trap for it? Does a snare spring up from the ground, when it has taken nothing?
30Am 3:6 Is a trumpet blown in a city, and the people are not afraid? Does disaster come to a city, unless the LORD has done it?
30Am 3:7 "For the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.
30Am 3:8 The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken; who can but prophesy?"
30Am 3:9 Proclaim to the strongholds in Ashdod and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt, and say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and see the great tumults within her, and the oppressed in her midst."
30Am 3:10 "They do not know how to do right," declares the LORD, "those who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds."
30Am 3:11 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "An adversary shall surround the land and bring down your defenses from you, and your strongholds shall be plundered."
30Am 3:12 Thus says the LORD: "As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who dwell in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed.
30Am 3:13 "Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob," declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
30Am 3:14 "that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions, I will punish the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground.
30Am 3:15 I will strike the winter house along with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall come to an end," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:1 "Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to your husbands, 'Bring, that we may drink!'
30Am 4:2 The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness that, behold, the days are coming upon you, when they shall take you away with hooks, even the last of you with fishhooks.
30Am 4:3 And you shall go out through the breaches, each one straight ahead; and you shall be cast out into Harmon," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:4 "Come to Bethel, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days;
30Am 4:5 offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel!" declares the Lord GOD.
30Am 4:6 "I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:7 "I also withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest; I would send rain on one city, and send no rain on another city; one field would have rain, and the field on which it did not rain would wither;
30Am 4:8 so two or three cities would wander to another city to drink water, and would not be satisfied; yet you did not return to me," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:9 "I struck you with blight and mildew; your many gardens and your vineyards, your fig trees and your olive trees the locust devoured; yet you did not return to me," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:10 "I sent among you a pestilence after the manner of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, and carried away your horses, and I made the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils; yet you did not return to me," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:11 "I overthrew some of you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet you did not return to me," declares the LORD.
30Am 4:12 "Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!"
30Am 4:13 For behold, he who forms the mountains and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth-- the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name!
30Am 5:1 Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:
30Am 5:2 "Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel; forsaken on her land, with none to raise her up."
30Am 5:3 For thus says the Lord GOD: "The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went out a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel."
30Am 5:4 For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel: "Seek me and live;
30Am 5:5 but do not seek Bethel, and do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to nothing."
30Am 5:6 Seek the LORD and live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,
30Am 5:7 O you who turn justice to wormwood and cast down righteousness to the earth!
30Am 5:8 He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens the day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth, the LORD is his name;
30Am 5:9 who makes destruction flash forth against the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
30Am 5:10 They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks the truth.
30Am 5:11 Therefore because you trample on the poor and you exact taxes of grain from him, you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine.
30Am 5:12 For I know how many are your transgressions and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate.
30Am 5:13 Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time, for it is an evil time.
30Am 5:14 Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said.
30Am 5:15 Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
30Am 5:16 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord: "In all the squares there shall be wailing, and in all the streets they shall say, 'Alas! Alas!' They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,
30Am 5:17 and in all vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through your midst," says the LORD.
30Am 5:18 Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD! Why would you have the day of the LORD? It is darkness, and not light,
30Am 5:19 as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him, or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall, and a serpent bit him.
30Am 5:20 Is not the day of the LORD darkness, and not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?
30Am 5:21 "I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
30Am 5:22 Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; and the peace offerings of your fattened animals, I will not look upon them.
30Am 5:23 Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen.
30Am 5:24 But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
30Am 5:25 "Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
30Am 5:26 You shall take up Sikkuth your king, and Kiyyun your star-god--your images that you made for yourselves,
30Am 5:27 and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.
30Am 6:1 "Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who feel secure on the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the first of the nations, to whom the house of Israel comes!
30Am 6:2 Pass over to Calneh, and see, and from there go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory greater than your territory,
30Am 6:3 O you who put far away the day of disaster and bring near the seat of violence?
30Am 6:4 "Woe to those who lie on beds of ivory and stretch themselves out on their couches, and eat lambs from the flock and calves from the midst of the stall,
30Am 6:5 who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and like David invent for themselves instruments of music,
30Am 6:6 who drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!
30Am 6:7 Therefore they shall now be the first of those who go into exile, and the revelry of those who stretch themselves out shall pass away."
30Am 6:8 The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, declares the LORD, the God of hosts: "I abhor the pride of Jacob and hate his strongholds, and I will deliver up the city and all that is in it."
30Am 6:9 And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die.
30Am 6:10 And when one's relative, the one who anoints him for burial, shall take him up to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him who is in the innermost parts of the house, "Is there still anyone with you?" he shall say, "No"; and he shall say, "Silence! We must not mention the name of the LORD."
30Am 6:11 For behold, the LORD commands, and the great house shall be struck down into fragments, and the little house into bits.
30Am 6:12 Do horses run on rocks? Does one plow there with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood--
30Am 6:13 you who rejoice in Lo-debar, who say, "Have we not by our own strength captured Karnaim for ourselves?"
30Am 6:14 "For behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel," declares the LORD, the God of hosts; "and they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of the Arabah."
30Am 7:1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.
30Am 7:2 When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, "O Lord GOD, please forgive! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"
30Am 7:3 The LORD relented concerning this: "It shall not be," said the LORD.
30Am 7:4 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, the Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land.
30Am 7:5 Then I said, "O Lord GOD, please cease! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"
30Am 7:6 The LORD relented concerning this: "This also shall not be," said the Lord GOD.
30Am 7:7 This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
30Am 7:8 And the LORD said to me, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass by them;
30Am 7:9 the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."
30Am 7:10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.
30Am 7:11 For thus Amos has said, "'Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.'"
30Am 7:12 And Amaziah said to Amos, "O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there,
30Am 7:13 but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom."
30Am 7:14 Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, "I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs.
30Am 7:15 But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'
30Am 7:16 Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. "You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.'
30Am 7:17 Therefore thus says the LORD: "'Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided up with a measuring line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.'"
30Am 8:1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.
30Am 8:2 And he said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass by them.
30Am 8:3 The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day," declares the Lord GOD. "So many dead bodies!" "They are thrown everywhere!" "Silence!"
30Am 8:4 Hear this, you who trample on the needy and bring the poor of the land to an end,
30Am 8:5 saying, "When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may offer wheat for sale, that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great and deal deceitfully with false balances,
30Am 8:6 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and sell the chaff of the wheat?"
30Am 8:7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: "Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
30Am 8:8 Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who dwells in it, and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?"
30Am 8:9 "And on that day," declares the Lord GOD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
30Am 8:10 I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on every waist and baldness on every head; I will make it like the mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.
30Am 8:11 "Behold, the days are coming," declares the Lord GOD, "when I will send a famine on the land-- not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
30Am 8:12 They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.
30Am 8:13 "In that day the lovely virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst.
30Am 8:14 Those who swear by the Guilt of Samaria, and say, 'As your god lives, O Dan,' and, 'As the Way of Beersheba lives,' they shall fall, and never rise again."
30Am 9:1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said: "Strike the capitals until the thresholds shake, and shatter them on the heads of all the people; and those who are left of them I will kill with the sword; not one of them shall flee away; not one of them shall escape.
30Am 9:2 "If they dig into Sheol, from there shall my hand take them; if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down.
30Am 9:3 If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will search them out and take them; and if they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
30Am 9:4 And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it shall kill them; and I will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good."
30Am 9:5 The Lord GOD of hosts, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile, and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;
30Am 9:6 who builds his upper chambers in the heavens and founds his vault upon the earth; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth-- the LORD is his name.
30Am 9:7 "Are you not like the Cushites to me, O people of Israel?" declares the LORD. "Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?
30Am 9:8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground, except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob," declares the LORD.
30Am 9:9 "For behold, I will command, and shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one shakes with a sieve, but no pebble shall fall to the earth.
30Am 9:10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, 'Disaster shall not overtake or meet us.'
30Am 9:11 "In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old,
30Am 9:12 that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name," declares the LORD who does this.
30Am 9:13 "Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him who sows the seed; the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it.
30Am 9:14 I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.
30Am 9:15 I will plant them on their land, and they shall never again be uprooted out of the land that I have given them," says the LORD your God.

31Ob 1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom: We have heard a report from the LORD, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: "Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!"
31Ob 1:2 Behold, I will make you small among the nations; you shall be utterly despised.
31Ob 1:3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?"
31Ob 1:4 Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down, declares the LORD.
31Ob 1:5 If thieves came to you, if plunderers came by night-- how you have been destroyed!-- would they not steal only enough for themselves? If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?
31Ob 1:6 How Esau has been pillaged, his treasures sought out!
31Ob 1:7 All your allies have driven you to your border; those at peace with you have deceived you; they have prevailed against you; those who eat your bread have set a trap beneath you-- you have no understanding.
31Ob 1:8 Will I not on that day, declares the LORD, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of Mount Esau?
31Ob 1:9 And your mighty men shall be dismayed, O Teman, so that every man from Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter.
31Ob 1:10 Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever.
31Ob 1:11 On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.
31Ob 1:12 But do not gloat over the day of your brother in the day of his misfortune; do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their ruin; do not boast in the day of distress.
31Ob 1:13 Do not enter the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; do not gloat over his disaster in the day of his calamity; do not loot his wealth in the day of his calamity.
31Ob 1:14 Do not stand at the crossroads to cut off his fugitives; do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
31Ob 1:15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head.
31Ob 1:16 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so all the nations shall drink continually; they shall drink and swallow, and shall be as though they had never been.
31Ob 1:17 But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape, and it shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.
31Ob 1:18 The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble; they shall burn them and consume them, and there shall be no survivor for the house of Esau, for the LORD has spoken.
31Ob 1:19 Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau, and those of the Shephelah shall possess the land of the Philistines; they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the land of Samaria, and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
31Ob 1:20 The exiles of this host of the people of Israel shall possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the Negeb.
31Ob 1:21 Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

32Jnh 1:1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
32Jnh 1:2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me."
32Jnh 1:3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
32Jnh 1:4 But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up.
32Jnh 1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep.
32Jnh 1:6 So the captain came and said to him, "What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish."
32Jnh 1:7 And they said to one another, "Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us." So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
32Jnh 1:8 Then they said to him, "Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?"
32Jnh 1:9 And he said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
32Jnh 1:10 Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, "What is this that you have done!" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
32Jnh 1:11 Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?" For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
32Jnh 1:12 He said to them, "Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you."
32Jnh 1:13 Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
32Jnh 1:14 Therefore they called out to the LORD, "O LORD, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not on us innocent blood, for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you."
32Jnh 1:15 So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.
32Jnh 1:16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
32Jnh 1:17  And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
32Jnh 2:1 Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
32Jnh 2:2 saying, "I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.
32Jnh 2:3 For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.
32Jnh 2:4 Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.'
32Jnh 2:5 The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head
32Jnh 2:6 at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
32Jnh 2:7 When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.
32Jnh 2:8 Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love.
32Jnh 2:9 But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the LORD!"
32Jnh 2:10 And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
32Jnh 3:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,
32Jnh 3:2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you."
32Jnh 3:3 So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days' journey in breadth.
32Jnh 3:4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
32Jnh 3:5 And the people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.
32Jnh 3:6 The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
32Jnh 3:7 And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water,
32Jnh 3:8 but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
32Jnh 3:9 Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish."
32Jnh 3:10 When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.
32Jnh 4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
32Jnh 4:2 And he prayed to the LORD and said, "O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster.
32Jnh 4:3 Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:4 And the LORD said, "Do you do well to be angry?"
32Jnh 4:5 Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
32Jnh 4:6 Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant.
32Jnh 4:7 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered.
32Jnh 4:8 When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:9 But God said to Jonah, "Do you do well to be angry for the plant?" And he said, "Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die."
32Jnh 4:10 And the LORD said, "You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night.
32Jnh 4:11 And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?"

33Mc 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:2 Hear, you peoples, all of you; pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it, and let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
33Mc 1:3 For behold, the LORD is coming out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
33Mc 1:4 And the mountains will melt under him, and the valleys will split open, like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep place.
33Mc 1:5 All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
33Mc 1:6 Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards, and I will pour down her stones into the valley and uncover her foundations.
33Mc 1:7 All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste, for from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them, and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return.
33Mc 1:8 For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make lamentation like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches.
33Mc 1:9 For her wound is incurable, and it has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:10 Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all; in Beth-le-aphrah roll yourselves in the dust.
33Mc 1:11 Pass on your way, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out; the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place.
33Mc 1:12 For the inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good, because disaster has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:13 Harness the steeds to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish; it was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.
33Mc 1:14 Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
33Mc 1:15 I will again bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam.
33Mc 1:16 Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair, for the children of your delight; make yourselves as bald as the eagle, for they shall go from you into exile.
33Mc 2:1 Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in the power of their hand.
33Mc 2:2 They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.
33Mc 2:3 Therefore thus says the LORD: behold, against this family I am devising disaster, from which you cannot remove your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be a time of disaster.
33Mc 2:4 In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly, and say, "We are utterly ruined; he changes the portion of my people; how he removes it from me! To an apostate he allots our fields."
33Mc 2:5 Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
33Mc 2:6 "Do not preach"--thus they preach-- "one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us."
33Mc 2:7 Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Has the LORD grown impatient? Are these his deeds? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?
33Mc 2:8 But lately my people have risen up as an enemy; you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war.
33Mc 2:9 The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses; from their young children you take away my splendor forever.
33Mc 2:10 Arise and go, for this is no place to rest, because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction.
33Mc 2:11 If a man should go about and utter wind and lies, saying, "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink," he would be the preacher for this people!
33Mc 2:12 I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob; I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men.
33Mc 2:13 He who opens the breach goes up before them; they break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king passes on before them, the LORD at their head.
33Mc 3:1 And I said: Hear, you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel! Is it not for you to know justice?--
33Mc 3:2 you who hate the good and love the evil, who tear the skin from off my people and their flesh from off their bones,
33Mc 3:3 who eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones in pieces and chop them up like meat in a pot, like flesh in a cauldron.
33Mc 3:4 Then they will cry to the LORD, but he will not answer them; he will hide his face from them at that time, because they have made their deeds evil.
33Mc 3:5 Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry "Peace" when they have something to eat, but declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths.
33Mc 3:6 Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without divination. The sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be black over them;
33Mc 3:7 the seers shall be disgraced, and the diviners put to shame; they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God.
33Mc 3:8 But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
33Mc 3:9 Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, who detest justice and make crooked all that is straight,
33Mc 3:10 who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity.
33Mc 3:11 Its heads give judgment for a bribe; its priests teach for a price; its prophets practice divination for money; yet they lean on the LORD and say, "Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No disaster shall come upon us."
33Mc 3:12 Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.
33Mc 4:1 It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it,
33Mc 4:2 and many nations shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:3 He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations far away; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore;
33Mc 4:4 but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.
33Mc 4:5 For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
33Mc 4:6 In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted;
33Mc 4:7 and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore.
33Mc 4:8 And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:9 Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor?
33Mc 4:10 Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
33Mc 4:11 Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, "Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion."
33Mc 4:12 But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.
33Mc 4:13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
33Mc 5:1  Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops; siege is laid against us; with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek.
33Mc 5:2  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.
33Mc 5:3 Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel.
33Mc 5:4 And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth.
33Mc 5:5 And he shall be their peace. When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men;
33Mc 5:6 they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances; and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian when he comes into our land and treads within our border.
33Mc 5:7 Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which delay not for a man nor wait for the children of man.
33Mc 5:8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, which, when it goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
33Mc 5:9 Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries, and all your enemies shall be cut off.
33Mc 5:10 And in that day, declares the LORD, I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots;
33Mc 5:11 and I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds;
33Mc 5:12 and I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more tellers of fortunes;
33Mc 5:13 and I will cut off your carved images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands;
33Mc 5:14 and I will root out your Asherah images from among you and destroy your cities.
33Mc 5:15 And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance on the nations that did not obey.
33Mc 6:1 Hear what the LORD says: Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
33Mc 6:2 Hear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth, for the LORD has an indictment against his people, and he will contend with Israel.
33Mc 6:3 "O my people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Answer me!
33Mc 6:4 For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
33Mc 6:5 O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD."
33Mc 6:6 "With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
33Mc 6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
33Mc 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
33Mc 6:9 The voice of the LORD cries to the city-- and it is sound wisdom to fear your name: "Hear of the rod and of him who appointed it!
33Mc 6:10 Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed?
33Mc 6:11 Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights?
33Mc 6:12 Your rich men are full of violence; your inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
33Mc 6:13 Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow, making you desolate because of your sins.
33Mc 6:14 You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and there shall be hunger within you; you shall put away, but not preserve, and what you preserve I will give to the sword.
33Mc 6:15 You shall sow, but not reap; you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil; you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.
33Mc 6:16 For you have kept the statutes of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab; and you have walked in their counsels, that I may make you a desolation, and your inhabitants a hissing; so you shall bear the scorn of my people."
33Mc 7:1 Woe is me! For I have become as when the summer fruit has been gathered, as when the grapes have been gleaned: there is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fig that my soul desires.
33Mc 7:2 The godly has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind; they all lie in wait for blood, and each hunts the other with a net.
33Mc 7:3 Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe, and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul; thus they weave it together.
33Mc 7:4 The best of them is like a brier, the most upright of them a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, of your punishment, has come; now their confusion is at hand.
33Mc 7:5 Put no trust in a neighbor; have no confidence in a friend; guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms;
33Mc 7:6 for the son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
33Mc 7:7 But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.
33Mc 7:8 Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.
33Mc 7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall look upon his vindication.
33Mc 7:10 Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets.
33Mc 7:11 A day for the building of your walls! In that day the boundary shall be far extended.
33Mc 7:12 In that day they will come to you, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
33Mc 7:13 But the earth will be desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their deeds.
33Mc 7:14 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.
33Mc 7:15 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.
33Mc 7:16 The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf;
33Mc 7:17 they shall lick the dust like a serpent, like the crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their strongholds; they shall turn in dread to the LORD our God, and they shall be in fear of you.
33Mc 7:18 Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love.
33Mc 7:19 He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
33Mc 7:20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

34Nah 1:1 An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
34Nah 1:2 The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and wrathful; the LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies.
34Nah 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, and the LORD will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
34Nah 1:4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither; the bloom of Lebanon withers.
34Nah 1:5 The mountains quake before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who dwell in it.
34Nah 1:6 Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into pieces by him.
34Nah 1:7 The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him.
34Nah 1:8 But with an overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
34Nah 1:9 What do you plot against the LORD? He will make a complete end; trouble will not rise up a second time.
34Nah 1:10 For they are like entangled thorns, like drunkards as they drink; they are consumed like stubble fully dried.
34Nah 1:11 From you came one who plotted evil against the LORD, a worthless counselor.
34Nah 1:12 Thus says the LORD, "Though they are at full strength and many, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
34Nah 1:13 And now I will break his yoke from off you and will burst your bonds apart."
34Nah 1:14 The LORD has given commandment about you: "No more shall your name be perpetuated; from the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the metal image. I will make your grave, for you are vile."
34Nah 1:15  Behold, upon the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows, for never again shall the worthless pass through you; he is utterly cut off.
34Nah 2:1 The scatterer has come up against you. Man the ramparts; watch the road; dress for battle; collect all your strength.
34Nah 2:2 For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob as the majesty of Israel, for plunderers have plundered them and ruined their branches.
34Nah 2:3 The shield of his mighty men is red; his soldiers are clothed in scarlet. The chariots come with flashing metal on the day he musters them; the cypress spears are brandished.
34Nah 2:4 The chariots race madly through the streets; they rush to and fro through the squares; they gleam like torches; they dart like lightning.
34Nah 2:5 He remembers his officers; they stumble as they go, they hasten to the wall; the siege tower is set up.
34Nah 2:6 The river gates are opened; the palace melts away;
34Nah 2:7 its mistress is stripped; she is carried off, her slave girls lamenting, moaning like doves and beating their breasts.
34Nah 2:8 Nineveh is like a pool whose waters run away. "Halt! Halt!" they cry, but none turns back.
34Nah 2:9 Plunder the silver, plunder the gold! There is no end of the treasure or of the wealth of all precious things.
34Nah 2:10 Desolate! Desolation and ruin! Hearts melt and knees tremble; anguish is in all loins; all faces grow pale!
34Nah 2:11 Where is the lions' den, the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and lioness went, where his cubs were, with none to disturb?
34Nah 2:12 The lion tore enough for his cubs and strangled prey for his lionesses; he filled his caves with prey and his dens with torn flesh.
34Nah 2:13 Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.
34Nah 3:1 Woe to the bloody city, all full of lies and plunder-- no end to the prey!
34Nah 3:2 The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!
34Nah 3:3 Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end-- they stumble over the bodies!
34Nah 3:4 And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute, graceful and of deadly charms, who betrays nations with her whorings, and peoples with her charms.
34Nah 3:5 Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame.
34Nah 3:6 I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.
34Nah 3:7 And all who look at you will shrink from you and say, Wasted is Nineveh; who will grieve for her? Where shall I seek comforters for you?
34Nah 3:8 Are you better than Thebes that sat by the Nile, with water around her, her rampart a sea, and water her wall?
34Nah 3:9 Cush was her strength; Egypt too, and that without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers.
34Nah 3:10 Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity; her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; for her honored men lots were cast, and all her great men were bound in chains.
34Nah 3:11 You also will be drunken; you will go into hiding; you will seek a refuge from the enemy.
34Nah 3:12 All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs-- if shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.
34Nah 3:13 Behold, your troops are women in your midst. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has devoured your bars.
34Nah 3:14 Draw water for the siege; strengthen your forts; go into the clay; tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!
34Nah 3:15 There will the fire devour you; the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!
34Nah 3:16 You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust spreads its wings and flies away.
34Nah 3:17 Your princes are like grasshoppers, your scribes like clouds of locusts settling on the fences in a day of cold-- when the sun rises, they fly away; no one knows where they are.
34Nah 3:18 Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with none to gather them.
34Nah 3:19 There is no easing your hurt; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For upon whom has not come your unceasing evil?
35
35Hab 1:1 The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
35Hab 1:2 O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you "Violence!" and you will not save?
35Hab 1:3 Why do you make me see iniquity, and why do you idly look at wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.
35Hab 1:4 So the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; so justice goes forth perverted.
35Hab 1:5 "Look among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.
35Hab 1:6 For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth, to seize dwellings not their own.
35Hab 1:7 They are dreaded and fearsome; their justice and dignity go forth from themselves.
35Hab 1:8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, more fierce than the evening wolves; their horsemen press proudly on. Their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle swift to devour.
35Hab 1:9 They all come for violence, all their faces forward. They gather captives like sand.
35Hab 1:10 At kings they scoff, and at rulers they laugh. They laugh at every fortress, for they pile up earth and take it.
35Hab 1:11 Then they sweep by like the wind and go on, guilty men, whose own might is their god!"
35Hab 1:12 Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them as a judgment, and you, O Rock, have established them for reproof.
35Hab 1:13 You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong, why do you idly look at traitors and remain silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he?
35Hab 1:14 You make mankind like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler.
35Hab 1:15 He brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net; he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is glad.
35Hab 1:16 Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his dragnet; for by them he lives in luxury, and his food is rich.
35Hab 1:17 Is he then to keep on emptying his net and mercilessly killing nations forever?
35Hab 2:1 I will take my stand at my watchpost and station myself on the tower, and look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
35Hab 2:2 And the LORD answered me:<end-paragraph/> "Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it.
35Hab 2:3 For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end--it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.
35Hab 2:4 "Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith.
35Hab 2:5 "Moreover, wine is a traitor, an arrogant man who is never at rest. His greed is as wide as Sheol; like death he has never enough. He gathers for himself all nations and collects as his own all peoples."
35Hab 2:6 Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say, "Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own-- for how long?-- and loads himself with pledges!"
35Hab 2:7 Will not your debtors suddenly arise, and those awake who will make you tremble? Then you will be spoil for them.
35Hab 2:8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you, for the blood of man and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell in them.
35Hab 2:9 "Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be safe from the reach of harm!
35Hab 2:10 You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life.
35Hab 2:11 For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the woodwork respond.
35Hab 2:12 "Woe to him who builds a town with blood and founds a city on iniquity!
35Hab 2:13 Behold, is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor merely for fire, and nations weary themselves for nothing?
35Hab 2:14 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
35Hab 2:15 "Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink-- you pour out your wrath and make them drunk, in order to gaze at their nakedness!
35Hab 2:16 You will have your fill of shame instead of glory. Drink, yourself, and show your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD's right hand will come around to you, and utter shame will come upon your glory!
35Hab 2:17 The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them, for the blood of man and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell in them.
35Hab 2:18 "What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it, a metal image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in his own creation when he makes speechless idols!
35Hab 2:19 Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake; to a silent stone, Arise! Can this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it.
35Hab 2:20 But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him."
35Hab 3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
35Hab 3:2 O LORD, I have heard the report of you, and your work, O LORD, do I fear. In the midst of the years revive it; in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember mercy.
35Hab 3:3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His splendor covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. Selah
35Hab 3:4 His brightness was like the light; rays flashed from his hand; and there he veiled his power.
35Hab 3:5 Before him went pestilence, and plague followed at his heels.
35Hab 3:6 He stood and measured the earth; he looked and shook the nations; then the eternal mountains were scattered; the everlasting hills sank low. His were the everlasting ways.
35Hab 3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
35Hab 3:8 Was your wrath against the rivers, O LORD? Was your anger against the rivers, or your indignation against the sea, when you rode on your horses, on your chariot of salvation?
35Hab 3:9 You stripped the sheath from your bow, calling for many arrows. Selah You split the earth with rivers.
35Hab 3:10 The mountains saw you and writhed; the raging waters swept on; the deep gave forth its voice; it lifted its hands on high.
35Hab 3:11 The sun and moon stood still in their place at the light of your arrows as they sped, at the flash of your glittering spear.
35Hab 3:12 You marched through the earth in fury; you threshed the nations in anger.
35Hab 3:13 You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the house of the wicked, laying him bare from thigh to neck. Selah
35Hab 3:14 You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors, who came like a whirlwind to scatter me, rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret.
35Hab 3:15 You trampled the sea with your horses, the surging of mighty waters.
35Hab 3:16 I hear, and my body trembles; my lips quiver at the sound; rottenness enters into my bones; my legs tremble beneath me. Yet I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon people who invade us.
35Hab 3:17 Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls,
35Hab 3:18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will take joy in the God of my salvation.
35Hab 3:19 GOD, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer's; he makes me tread on my high places. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments.

36Zph 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
36Zph 1:2 "I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
36Zph 1:3 "I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the rubble with the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
36Zph 1:4 "I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal and the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,
36Zph 1:5 those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens, those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by Milcom,
36Zph 1:6 those who have turned back from following the LORD, who do not seek the LORD or inquire of him."
36Zph 1:7 Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.
36Zph 1:8 And on the day of the LORD's sacrifice-- "I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all who array themselves in foreign attire.
36Zph 1:9 On that day I will punish everyone who leaps over the threshold, and those who fill their master's house with violence and fraud.
36Zph 1:10 "On that day," declares the LORD, "a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, a loud crash from the hills.
36Zph 1:11 Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar! For all the traders are no more; all who weigh out silver are cut off.
36Zph 1:12 At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are complacent, those who say in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good, nor will he do ill.'
36Zph 1:13 Their goods shall be plundered, and their houses laid waste. Though they build houses, they shall not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they shall not drink wine from them."
36Zph 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, near and hastening fast; the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter; the mighty man cries aloud there.
36Zph 1:15 A day of wrath is that day, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
36Zph 1:16 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the lofty battlements.
36Zph 1:17 I will bring distress on mankind, so that they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD; their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
36Zph 1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. In the fire of his jealousy, all the earth shall be consumed; for a full and sudden end he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.
36Zph 2:1 Gather together, yes, gather, O shameless nation,
36Zph 2:2 before the decree takes effect--before the day passes away like chaff-- before there comes upon you the burning anger of the LORD, before there comes upon you the day of the anger of the LORD.
36Zph 2:3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his just commands; seek righteousness; seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the anger of the LORD.
36Zph 2:4 For Gaza shall be deserted, and Ashkelon shall become a desolation; Ashdod's people shall be driven out at noon, and Ekron shall be uprooted.
36Zph 2:5 Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast, you nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.
36Zph 2:6 And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures, with meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.
36Zph 2:7 The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah, on which they shall graze, and in the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the LORD their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes.
36Zph 2:8 "I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory.
36Zph 2:9 Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Moab shall become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a land possessed by nettles and salt pits, and a waste forever. The remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the survivors of my nation shall possess them."
36Zph 2:10 This shall be their lot in return for their pride, because they taunted and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.
36Zph 2:11 The LORD will be awesome against them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth, and to him shall bow down, each in its place, all the lands of the nations.
36Zph 2:12 You also, O Cushites, shall be slain by my sword.
36Zph 2:13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, and he will make Nineveh a desolation, a dry waste like the desert.
36Zph 2:14 Herds shall lie down in her midst, all kinds of beasts; even the owl and the hedgehog shall lodge in her capitals; a voice shall hoot in the window; devastation will be on the threshold; for her cedar work will be laid bare.
36Zph 2:15 This is the exultant city that lived securely, that said in her heart, "I am, and there is no one else." What a desolation she has become, a lair for wild beasts! Everyone who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist.
36Zph 3:1 Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, the oppressing city!
36Zph 3:2 She listens to no voice; she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the LORD; she does not draw near to her God.
36Zph 3:3 Her officials within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves that leave nothing till the morning.
36Zph 3:4 Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men; her priests profane what is holy; they do violence to the law.
36Zph 3:5 The LORD within her is righteous; he does no injustice; every morning he shows forth his justice; each dawn he does not fail; but the unjust knows no shame.
36Zph 3:6 "I have cut off nations; their battlements are in ruins; I have laid waste their streets so that no one walks in them; their cities have been made desolate, without a man, without an inhabitant.
36Zph 3:7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me; you will accept correction. Then your dwelling would not be cut off according to all that I have appointed against you.' But all the more they were eager to make all their deeds corrupt.
36Zph 3:8 "Therefore wait for me," declares the LORD, "for the day when I rise up to seize the prey. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all my burning anger; for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth shall be consumed.
36Zph 3:9 "For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call upon the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord.
36Zph 3:10 From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers, the daughter of my dispersed ones, shall bring my offering.
36Zph 3:11 "On that day you shall not be put to shame because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me; for then I will remove from your midst your proudly exultant ones, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain.
36Zph 3:12 But I will leave in your midst a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD,
36Zph 3:13 those who are left in Israel; they shall do no injustice and speak no lies, nor shall there be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue. For they shall graze and lie down, and none shall make them afraid."
36Zph 3:14 Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
36Zph 3:15 The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; he has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall never again fear evil.
36Zph 3:16 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: "Fear not, O Zion; let not your hands grow weak.
36Zph 3:17 The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.
36Zph 3:18 I will gather those of you who mourn for the festival, so that you will no longer suffer reproach.
36Zph 3:19 Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.
36Zph 3:20 At that time I will bring you in, at the time when I gather you together; for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes," says the LORD.

37Hg 1:1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest:
37Hg 1:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD."
37Hg 1:3 Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
37Hg 1:4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?
37Hg 1:5 Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
37Hg 1:6 You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.
37Hg 1:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
37Hg 1:8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD.
37Hg 1:9 You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.
37Hg 1:10 Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
37Hg 1:11 And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors."
37Hg 1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD.
37Hg 1:13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, "I am with you, declares the LORD."
37Hg 1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
37Hg 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
37Hg 2:1 In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
37Hg 2:2 "Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say,
37Hg 2:3 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
37Hg 2:4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the LORD. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD. Work, for I am with you, declares the LORD of hosts,
37Hg 2:5 according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not.
37Hg 2:6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.
37Hg 2:7 And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts.
37Hg 2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD of hosts.
37Hg 2:9 The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the LORD of hosts.'"
37Hg 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet,
37Hg 2:11 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Ask the priests about the law:
37Hg 2:12 'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?'" The priests answered and said, "No."
37Hg 2:13 Then Haggai said, "If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?" The priests answered and said, "It does become unclean."
37Hg 2:14 Then Haggai answered and said, "So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the LORD, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean.
37Hg 2:15 Now then, consider from this day onward. Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the LORD,
37Hg 2:16 how did you fare? When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.
37Hg 2:17 I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail, yet you did not turn to me, declares the LORD.
37Hg 2:18 Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider:
37Hg 2:19 Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on I will bless you."
37Hg 2:20 The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month,
37Hg 2:21 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
37Hg 2:22 and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his brother.
37Hg 2:23 On that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel, declares the LORD, and make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the LORD of hosts."
38
38Zch 1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,
38Zch 1:2 "The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
38Zch 1:3 Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 1:4 Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.' But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD.
38Zch 1:5 Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
38Zch 1:6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us."
38Zch 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,
38Zch 1:8 "I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
38Zch 1:9 Then I said, 'What are these, my lord?' The angel who talked with me said to me, 'I will show you what they are.'
38Zch 1:10 So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, 'These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.'
38Zch 1:11 And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, 'We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.'
38Zch 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD said, 'O LORD of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?'
38Zch 1:13 And the LORD answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
38Zch 1:14 So the angel who talked with me said to me, 'Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
38Zch 1:15 And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little, they furthered the disaster.
38Zch 1:16 Therefore, thus says the LORD, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; my house shall be built in it, declares the LORD of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
38Zch 1:17 Cry out again, Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.'"
38Zch 1:18  And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns!
38Zch 1:19 And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these?" And he said to me, "These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
38Zch 1:21 And I said, "What are these coming to do?" He said, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it."
38Zch 2:1  And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand!
38Zch 2:2 Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length."
38Zch 2:3 And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him
38Zch 2:4 and said to him, "Run, say to that young man, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it.
38Zch 2:5 And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"
38Zch 2:6 Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the LORD. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the LORD.
38Zch 2:7 Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
38Zch 2:8 For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye:
38Zch 2:9 "Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
38Zch 2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD.
38Zch 2:11 And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38Zch 2:12 And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem."
38Zch 2:13 Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
38Zch 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
38Zch 3:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?"
38Zch 3:3 Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments.
38Zch 3:4 And the angel said to those who were standing before him, "Remove the filthy garments from him." And to him he said, "Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments."
38Zch 3:5 And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by.
38Zch 3:6 And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured Joshua,
38Zch 3:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here.
38Zch 3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch.
38Zch 3:9 For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven eyes, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
38Zch 3:10 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree."
38Zch 4:1 And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.
38Zch 4:2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
38Zch 4:3 And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left."
38Zch 4:4 And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 4:5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord."
38Zch 4:6 Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 4:7 Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!'"
38Zch 4:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
38Zch 4:9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38Zch 4:10 For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. "These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth."
38Zch 4:11 Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?"
38Zch 4:12 And a second time I answered and said to him, "What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out?"
38Zch 4:13 He said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord."
38Zch 4:14 Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38Zch 5:1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll!
38Zch 5:2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits."
38Zch 5:3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears falsely shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side.
38Zch 5:4 I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall remain in his house and consume it, both timber and stones."
38Zch 5:5 Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, "Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out."
38Zch 5:6 And I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is the basket that is going out." And he said, "This is their iniquity in all the land."
38Zch 5:7 And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket!
38Zch 5:8 And he said, "This is Wickedness." And he thrust her back into the basket, and thrust down the leaden weight on its opening.
38Zch 5:9 Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! The wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.
38Zch 5:10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"
38Zch 5:11 He said to me, "To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it. And when this is prepared, they will set the basket down there on its base."
38Zch 6:1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze.
38Zch 6:2 The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses,
38Zch 6:3 the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses--all of them strong.
38Zch 6:4 Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 6:5 And the angel answered and said to me, "These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the LORD of all the earth.
38Zch 6:6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country."
38Zch 6:7 When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
38Zch 6:8 Then he cried to me, "Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country."
38Zch 6:9 And the word of the LORD came to me:
38Zch 6:10 "Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.
38Zch 6:11 Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
38Zch 6:12 And say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD.
38Zch 6:13 It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there shall be a priest on his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both."'
38Zch 6:14 And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as a reminder to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.
38Zch 6:15 "And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God."
38Zch 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
38Zch 7:2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to entreat the favor of the LORD,
38Zch 7:3 saying to the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and the prophets, "Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?"
38Zch 7:4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
38Zch 7:5 "Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted?
38Zch 7:6 And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
38Zch 7:7 Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?"
38Zch 7:8 And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
38Zch 7:9 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,
38Zch 7:10 do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart."
38Zch 7:11 But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.
38Zch 7:12 They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 7:13 "As I called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear," says the LORD of hosts,
38Zch 7:14 "and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate."
38Zch 8:1 And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
38Zch 8:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
38Zch 8:3 Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.
38Zch 8:4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age.
38Zch 8:5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
38Zch 8:6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts?
38Zch 8:7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country,
38Zch 8:8 and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness."
38Zch 8:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
38Zch 8:10 For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
38Zch 8:11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 8:12 For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
38Zch 8:13 And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong."
38Zch 8:14 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
38Zch 8:15 so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not.
38Zch 8:16 These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace;
38Zch 8:17 do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD."
38Zch 8:18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
38Zch 8:19 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.
38Zch 8:20 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
38Zch 8:21 The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, 'Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.'
38Zch 8:22 Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.
38Zch 8:23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'"
38Zch 9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and Damascus is its resting place. For the LORD has an eye on mankind and on all the tribes of Israel,
38Zch 9:2 and on Hamath also, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
38Zch 9:3 Tyre has built herself a rampart and heaped up silver like dust, and fine gold like the mud of the streets.
38Zch 9:4 But behold, the Lord will strip her of her possessions and strike down her power on the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire.
38Zch 9:5 Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;
38Zch 9:6 a mixed people shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of Philistia.
38Zch 9:7 I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.
38Zch 9:8 Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again march over them, for now I see with my own eyes.
38Zch 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38Zch 9:10 I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace to the nations; his rule shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
38Zch 9:11 As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
38Zch 9:12 Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
38Zch 9:13 For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword.
38Zch 9:14 Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow will go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and will march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
38Zch 9:15 The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour, and tread down the sling stones, and they shall drink and roar as if drunk with wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.
38Zch 9:16 On that day the LORD their God will save them, as the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land.
38Zch 9:17 For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women.
38Zch 10:1 Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain, from the LORD who makes the storm clouds, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone the vegetation in the field.
38Zch 10:2 For the household gods utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; they tell false dreams and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd.
38Zch 10:3 "My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD of hosts cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his majestic steed in battle.
38Zch 10:4 From him shall come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler--all of them together.
38Zch 10:5 They shall be like mighty men in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight because the LORD is with them, and they shall put to shame the riders on horses.
38Zch 10:6 "I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
38Zch 10:7 Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and be glad; their hearts shall rejoice in the LORD.
38Zch 10:8 "I will whistle for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as many as they were before.
38Zch 10:9 Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and with their children they shall live and return.
38Zch 10:10 I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria, and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, till there is no room for them.
38Zch 10:11 He shall pass through the sea of troubles and strike down the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up. The pride of Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
38Zch 10:12 I will make them strong in the LORD, and they shall walk in his name," declares the LORD.
38Zch 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars!
38Zch 11:2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled!
38Zch 11:3 The sound of the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is ruined! The sound of the roar of the lions, for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
38Zch 11:4 Thus said the LORD my God: "Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter.
38Zch 11:5 Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich,' and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
38Zch 11:6 For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the LORD. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand."
38Zch 11:7 So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named Favor, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep.
38Zch 11:8 In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.
38Zch 11:9 So I said, "I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another."
38Zch 11:10 And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
38Zch 11:11 So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD.
38Zch 11:12 Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver.
38Zch 11:13 Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter"--the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter.
38Zch 11:14 Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
38Zch 11:15 Then the LORD said to me, "Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38Zch 11:16 For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
38Zch 11:17 "Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded!"
38Zch 12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel: Thus declares the LORD, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him:
38Zch 12:2 "Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah.
38Zch 12:3 On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
38Zch 12:4 On that day, declares the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
38Zch 12:5 Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the LORD of hosts, their God.'
38Zch 12:6 "On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:7 "And the LORD will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah.
38Zch 12:8 On that day the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the LORD, going before them.
38Zch 12:9 And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:10 "And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn.
38Zch 12:11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38Zch 12:12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38Zch 12:13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38Zch 12:14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
38Zch 13:1 "On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness.
38Zch 13:2 "And on that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more. And also I will remove from the land the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness.
38Zch 13:3 And if anyone again prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD.' And his father and mother who bore him shall pierce him through when he prophesies.
38Zch 13:4 "On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies. He will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive,
38Zch 13:5 but he will say, 'I am no prophet, I am a worker of the soil, for a man sold me in my youth.'
38Zch 13:6 And if one asks him, 'What are these wounds on your back?' he will say, 'The wounds I received in the house of my friends.'
38Zch 13:7 "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me," declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones.
38Zch 13:8 In the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive.
38Zch 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'They are my people'; and they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"
38Zch 14:1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst.
38Zch 14:2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
38Zch 14:3 Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle.
38Zch 14:4 On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward.
38Zch 14:5 And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
38Zch 14:6 On that day there shall be no light, cold, or frost.
38Zch 14:7 And there shall be a unique day, which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light.
38Zch 14:8 On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. It shall continue in summer as in winter.
38Zch 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one and his name one.
38Zch 14:10 The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
38Zch 14:11 And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. Jerusalem shall dwell in security.
38Zch 14:12 And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
38Zch 14:13 And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other.
38Zch 14:14 Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.
38Zch 14:15 And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps.
38Zch 14:16 Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths.
38Zch 14:17 And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.
38Zch 14:18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain; there shall be the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths.
38Zch 14:19 This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths.
38Zch 14:20 And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "Holy to the LORD." And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar.
38Zch 14:21 And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day.

39Mal 1:1 The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
39Mal 1:2 "I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How have you loved us?" "Is not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob
39Mal 1:3 but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert."
39Mal 1:4 If Edom says, "We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins," the LORD of hosts says, "They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called 'the wicked country,' and 'the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.'"
39Mal 1:5 Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, "Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!"
39Mal 1:6 "A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, 'How have we despised your name?'
39Mal 1:7 By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, 'How have we polluted you?' By saying that the LORD's table may be despised.
39Mal 1:8 When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:9 And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:10 Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand.
39Mal 1:11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:12 But you profane it when you say that the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised.
39Mal 1:13 But you say, 'What a weariness this is,' and you snort at it, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD.
39Mal 1:14 Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name will be feared among the nations.
39Mal 2:1 "And now, O priests, this command is for you.
39Mal 2:2 If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
39Mal 2:3 Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it.
39Mal 2:4 So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 2:5 My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.
39Mal 2:6 True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
39Mal 2:7 For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 2:8 But you have turned aside from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,
39Mal 2:9 and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction."
39Mal 2:10 Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
39Mal 2:11 Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
39Mal 2:12 May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts!
39Mal 2:13 And this second thing you do. You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.
39Mal 2:14 But you say, "Why does he not?" Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
39Mal 2:15 Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth.
39Mal 2:16 "For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless."
39Mal 2:17 You have wearied the LORD with your words. But you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them." Or by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"
39Mal 3:1 "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:2 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap.
39Mal 3:3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD.
39Mal 3:4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
39Mal 3:5 "Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:6 "For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.
39Mal 3:7 From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, 'How shall we return?'
39Mal 3:8 Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In your tithes and contributions.
39Mal 3:9 You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
39Mal 3:10 Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.
39Mal 3:11 I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:12 Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:13 "Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, 'How have we spoken against you?'
39Mal 3:14 You have said, 'It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts?
39Mal 3:15 And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.'"
39Mal 3:16 Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name.
39Mal 3:17 "They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
39Mal 3:18 Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
39Mal 4:1  "For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
39Mal 4:2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.
39Mal 4:3 And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 4:4 "Remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and rules that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.
39Mal 4:5 "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
39Mal 4:6 And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction."
