05Dt 1:1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
05Dt 1:2 It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
05Dt 1:3 In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them,
05Dt 1:4 after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.
05Dt 1:5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,
05Dt 1:6 "The LORD our God said to us in Horeb, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
05Dt 1:7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
05Dt 1:8 See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.'
05Dt 1:9 "At that time I said to you, 'I am not able to bear you by myself.
05Dt 1:10 The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven.
05Dt 1:11 May the LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you!
05Dt 1:12 How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife?
05Dt 1:13 Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.'
05Dt 1:14 And you answered me, 'The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.'
05Dt 1:15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes.
05Dt 1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, 'Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.
05Dt 1:17 You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'
05Dt 1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
05Dt 1:19 "Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us. And we came to Kadesh-barnea.
05Dt 1:20 And I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
05Dt 1:21 See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not fear or be dismayed.'
05Dt 1:22 Then all of you came near me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.'
05Dt 1:23 The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe.
05Dt 1:24 And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
05Dt 1:25 And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, 'It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.'
05Dt 1:26 "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
05Dt 1:27 And you murmured in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
05Dt 1:28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there."'
05Dt 1:29 Then I said to you, 'Do not be in dread or afraid of them.
05Dt 1:30 The LORD your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
05Dt 1:31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.'
05Dt 1:32 Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the LORD your God,
05Dt 1:33 who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.
05Dt 1:34 "And the LORD heard your words and was angered, and he swore,
05Dt 1:35 'Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
05Dt 1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the LORD!'
05Dt 1:37 Even with me the LORD was angry on your account and said, 'You also shall not go in there.
05Dt 1:38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
05Dt 1:39 And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
05Dt 1:40 But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.'
05Dt 1:41 "Then you answered me, 'We have sinned against the LORD. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:42 And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.'
05Dt 1:43 So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:44 Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
05Dt 1:45 And you returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD did not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
05Dt 1:46 So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.
05Dt 2:1 "Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir.
05Dt 2:2 Then the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:3 'You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward
05Dt 2:4 and command the people, "You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.
05Dt 2:5 Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
05Dt 2:6 You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.
05Dt 2:7 For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing."'
05Dt 2:8 So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber. "And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.
05Dt 2:9 And the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.'
05Dt 2:10 (The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim.
05Dt 2:11 Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
05Dt 2:12 The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.)
05Dt 2:13 'Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the brook Zered.
05Dt 2:14 And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
05Dt 2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.
05Dt 2:16 "So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,
05Dt 2:17 the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:18 'Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
05Dt 2:19 And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.'
05Dt 2:20 (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there--but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim--
05Dt 2:21 a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
05Dt 2:22 as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.
05Dt 2:23 As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
05Dt 2:24 'Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle.
05Dt 2:25 This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
05Dt 2:26 "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
05Dt 2:27 'Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.
05Dt 2:28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,
05Dt 2:29 as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.'
05Dt 2:30 But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day.
05Dt 2:31 And the LORD said to me, 'Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.'
05Dt 2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
05Dt 2:33 And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.
05Dt 2:34 And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors.
05Dt 2:35 Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.
05Dt 2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands.
05Dt 2:37 Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us.
05Dt 3:1 "Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
05Dt 3:2 But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'
05Dt 3:3 So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.
05Dt 3:4 And we took all his cities at that time--there was not a city that we did not take from them--sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05Dt 3:5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.
05Dt 3:6 And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children.
05Dt 3:7 But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
05Dt 3:8 So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
05Dt 3:9 (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),
05Dt 3:10 all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05Dt 3:11 (For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.)
05Dt 3:12 "When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities.
05Dt 3:13 The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim.
05Dt 3:14 Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
05Dt 3:15 To Machir I gave Gilead,
05Dt 3:16 and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;
05Dt 3:17 the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
05Dt 3:18 "And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel.
05Dt 3:19 Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,
05Dt 3:20 until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.'
05Dt 3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.
05Dt 3:22 You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'
05Dt 3:23 "And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
05Dt 3:24 'O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?
05Dt 3:25 Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'
05Dt 3:26 But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, 'Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.
05Dt 3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan.
05Dt 3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.'
05Dt 3:29 So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
05Dt 4:1 "And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
05Dt 4:2 You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.
05Dt 4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor.
05Dt 4:4 But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today.
05Dt 4:5 See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 4:6 Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
05Dt 4:7 For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him?
05Dt 4:8 And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?
05Dt 4:9 "Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children--
05Dt 4:10 how on the day that you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, 'Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.'
05Dt 4:11 And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom.
05Dt 4:12 Then the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but saw no form; there was only a voice.
05Dt 4:13 And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
05Dt 4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess.
05Dt 4:15 "Therefore watch yourselves very carefully. Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
05Dt 4:16 beware lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
05Dt 4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,
05Dt 4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
05Dt 4:19 And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
05Dt 4:20 But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day.
05Dt 4:21 Furthermore, the LORD was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance.
05Dt 4:22 For I must die in this land; I must not go over the Jordan. But you shall go over and take possession of that good land.
05Dt 4:23 Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you.
05Dt 4:24 For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
05Dt 4:25 "When you father children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, so as to provoke him to anger,
05Dt 4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed.
05Dt 4:27 And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you.
05Dt 4:28 And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
05Dt 4:29 But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 4:30 When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice.
05Dt 4:31 For the LORD your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them.
05Dt 4:32 "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of.
05Dt 4:33 Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live?
05Dt 4:34 Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
05Dt 4:35 To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him.
05Dt 4:36 Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
05Dt 4:37 And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,
05Dt 4:38 driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day,
05Dt 4:39 know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
05Dt 4:40 Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan,
05Dt 4:42 that the manslayer might flee there, anyone who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past; he may flee to one of these cities and save his life:
05Dt 4:43 Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
05Dt 4:44 This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel.
05Dt 4:45 These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules, which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt,
05Dt 4:46 beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt.
05Dt 4:47 And they took possession of his land and the land of Og, the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan;
05Dt 4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),
05Dt 4:49 together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
05Dt 5:1 And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them.
05Dt 5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
05Dt 5:3 Not with our fathers did the LORD make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today.
05Dt 5:4 The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire,
05Dt 5:5 while I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD. For you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:
05Dt 5:6 "'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05Dt 5:7 "'You shall have no other gods before me.
05Dt 5:8 "'You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
05Dt 5:9 You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
05Dt 5:10 but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
05Dt 5:11 "'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
05Dt 5:12 "'Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.
05Dt 5:13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
05Dt 5:15 You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
05Dt 5:16 "'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 5:17 "'You shall not murder.
05Dt 5:18 "'And you shall not commit adultery.
05Dt 5:19 "'And you shall not steal.
05Dt 5:20 "'And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
05Dt 5:21 "'And you shall not covet your neighbor's wife. And you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.'
05Dt 5:22 "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
05Dt 5:23 And as soon as you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.
05Dt 5:24 And you said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live.
05Dt 5:25 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, we shall die.
05Dt 5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have, and has still lived?
05Dt 5:27 Go near and hear all that the LORD our God will say and speak to us all that the LORD our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.'
05Dt 5:28 "And the LORD heard your words, when you spoke to me. And the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They are right in all that they have spoken.
05Dt 5:29 Oh that they had such a mind as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever!
05Dt 5:30 Go and say to them, "Return to your tents."
05Dt 5:31 But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you the whole commandment and the statutes and the rules that you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.'
05Dt 5:32 You shall be careful therefore to do as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
05Dt 5:33 You shall walk in all the way that the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess.
05Dt 6:1 "Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the rules that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you, that you may do them in the land to which you are going over, to possess it,
05Dt 6:2 that you may fear the LORD your God, you and your son and your son's son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long.
05Dt 6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 6:4 "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
05Dt 6:5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
05Dt 6:6 And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.
05Dt 6:7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
05Dt 6:8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
05Dt 6:9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
05Dt 6:10 "And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you--with great and good cities that you did not build,
05Dt 6:11 and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant--and when you eat and are full,
05Dt 6:12 then take care lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05Dt 6:13 It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.
05Dt 6:14 You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you--
05Dt 6:15 for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God--lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
05Dt 6:16 "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.
05Dt 6:17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
05Dt 6:18 And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and take possession of the good land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers
05Dt 6:19 by thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has promised.
05Dt 6:20 "When your son asks you in time to come, 'What is the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules that the LORD our God has commanded you?'
05Dt 6:21 then you shall say to your son, 'We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt. And the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05Dt 6:22 And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his household, before our eyes.
05Dt 6:23 And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in and give us the land that he swore to give to our fathers.
05Dt 6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are this day.
05Dt 6:25 And it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.'
05Dt 7:1 "When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than yourselves,
05Dt 7:2 and when the LORD your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them.
05Dt 7:3 You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,
05Dt 7:4 for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
05Dt 7:5 But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire.
05Dt 7:6 "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
05Dt 7:7 It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
05Dt 7:8 but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05Dt 7:9 Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,
05Dt 7:10 and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
05Dt 7:11 You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.
05Dt 7:12 "And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers.
05Dt 7:13 He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you.
05Dt 7:14 You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
05Dt 7:15 And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.
05Dt 7:16 And you shall consume all the peoples that the LORD your God will give over to you. Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.
05Dt 7:17 "If you say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?'
05Dt 7:18 you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,
05Dt 7:19 the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. So will the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
05Dt 7:20 Moreover, the LORD your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed.
05Dt 7:21 You shall not be in dread of them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
05Dt 7:22 The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once, lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you.
05Dt 7:23 But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed.
05Dt 7:24 And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under heaven. No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.
05Dt 7:25 The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
05Dt 7:26 And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction.
05Dt 8:1 "The whole commandment that I command you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers.
05Dt 8:2 And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not.
05Dt 8:3 And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
05Dt 8:4 Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years.
05Dt 8:5 Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you.
05Dt 8:6 So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
05Dt 8:7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills,
05Dt 8:8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,
05Dt 8:9 a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
05Dt 8:10 And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
05Dt 8:11 "Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today,
05Dt 8:12 lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them,
05Dt 8:13 and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied,
05Dt 8:14 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
05Dt 8:15 who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock,
05Dt 8:16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end.
05Dt 8:17 Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.'
05Dt 8:18 You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
05Dt 8:19 And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.
05Dt 8:20 Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
05Dt 9:1 "Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
05Dt 9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'
05Dt 9:3 Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the LORD your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
05Dt 9:4 "Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you.
05Dt 9:5 Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
05Dt 9:6 "Know, therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people.
05Dt 9:7 Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
05Dt 9:8 Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
05Dt 9:9 When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
05Dt 9:10 And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
05Dt 9:11 And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
05Dt 9:12 Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.'
05Dt 9:13 "Furthermore, the LORD said to me, 'I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people.
05Dt 9:14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.'
05Dt 9:15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
05Dt 9:16 And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had made yourselves a golden calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
05Dt 9:17 So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
05Dt 9:18 Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger.
05Dt 9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the LORD bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.
05Dt 9:20 And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
05Dt 9:21 Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain.
05Dt 9:22 "At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.
05Dt 9:23 And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and did not believe him or obey his voice.
05Dt 9:24 You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
05Dt 9:25 "So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
05Dt 9:26 And I prayed to the LORD, 'O Lord GOD, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05Dt 9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin,
05Dt 9:28 lest the land from which you brought us say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness."
05Dt 9:29 For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.'
05Dt 10:1 "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood.
05Dt 10:2 And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.'
05Dt 10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
05Dt 10:4 And he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.
05Dt 10:5 Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made. And there they are, as the LORD commanded me."
05Dt 10:6 (The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place.
05Dt 10:7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water.
05Dt 10:8 At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day.
05Dt 10:9 Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God said to him.)
05Dt 10:10 "I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, and the LORD listened to me that time also. The LORD was unwilling to destroy you.
05Dt 10:11 And the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.'
05Dt 10:12 "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
05Dt 10:13 and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good?
05Dt 10:14 Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it.
05Dt 10:15 Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.
05Dt 10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.
05Dt 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.
05Dt 10:18 He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.
05Dt 10:19 Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
05Dt 10:20 You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.
05Dt 10:21 He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.
05Dt 10:22 Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
05Dt 11:1 "You shall therefore love the LORD your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always.
05Dt 11:2 And consider today (since I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,
05Dt 11:3 his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,
05Dt 11:4 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day,
05Dt 11:5 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,
05Dt 11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel.
05Dt 11:7 For your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD that he did.
05Dt 11:8 "You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,
05Dt 11:9 and that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 11:10 For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it, like a garden of vegetables.
05Dt 11:11 But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,
05Dt 11:12 a land that the LORD your God cares for. The eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
05Dt 11:13 "And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
05Dt 11:14 he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil.
05Dt 11:15 And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
05Dt 11:16 Take care lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them;
05Dt 11:17 then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and you will perish quickly off the good land that the LORD is giving you.
05Dt 11:18 "You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
05Dt 11:19 You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
05Dt 11:20 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
05Dt 11:21 that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.
05Dt 11:22 For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,
05Dt 11:23 then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
05Dt 11:24 Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours. Your territory shall be from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea.
05Dt 11:25 No one shall be able to stand against you. The LORD your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread, as he promised you.
05Dt 11:26 "See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
05Dt 11:27 the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you today,
05Dt 11:28 and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way that I am commanding you today, to go after other gods that you have not known.
05Dt 11:29 And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
05Dt 11:30 Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the road, toward the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oak of Moreh?
05Dt 11:31 For you are to cross over the Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you. And when you possess it and live in it,
05Dt 11:32 you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the rules that I am setting before you today.
05Dt 12:1 "These are the statutes and rules that you shall be careful to do in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth.
05Dt 12:2 You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
05Dt 12:3 You shall tear down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their Asherim with fire. You shall chop down the carved images of their gods and destroy their name out of that place.
05Dt 12:4 You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way.
05Dt 12:5 But you shall seek the place that the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go,
05Dt 12:6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
05Dt 12:7 And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your households, in all that you undertake, in which the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 12:8 "You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes,
05Dt 12:9 for you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 12:10 But when you go over the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies around, so that you live in safety,
05Dt 12:11 then to the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, and all your finest vow offerings that you vow to the LORD.
05Dt 12:12 And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male servants and your female servants, and the Levite that is within your towns, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
05Dt 12:13 Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place that you see,
05Dt 12:14 but at the place that the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I am commanding you.
05Dt 12:15 "However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, as much as you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and as of the deer.
05Dt 12:16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.
05Dt 12:17 You may not eat within your towns the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, or any of your vow offerings that you vow, or your freewill offerings or the contribution that you present,
05Dt 12:18 but you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place that the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your towns. And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you undertake.
05Dt 12:19 Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.
05Dt 12:20 "When the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, 'I will eat meat,' because you crave meat, you may eat meat whenever you desire.
05Dt 12:21 If the place that the LORD your God will choose to put his name there is too far from you, then you may kill any of your herd or your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.
05Dt 12:22 Just as the gazelle or the deer is eaten, so you may eat of it. The unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.
05Dt 12:23 Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
05Dt 12:24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.
05Dt 12:25 You shall not eat it, that all may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.
05Dt 12:26 But the holy things that are due from you, and your vow offerings, you shall take, and you shall go to the place that the LORD will choose,
05Dt 12:27 and offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, but the flesh you may eat.
05Dt 12:28 Be careful to obey all these words that I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 12:29 "When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations whom you go in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,
05Dt 12:30 take care that you be not ensnared to follow them, after they have been destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire about their gods, saying, 'How did these nations serve their gods?--that I also may do the same.'
05Dt 12:31 You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the LORD hates they have done for their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.
05Dt 12:32  "Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. You shall not add to it or take from it.
05Dt 13:1 "If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,
05Dt 13:2 and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, 'Let us go after other gods,' which you have not known, 'and let us serve them,'
05Dt 13:3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 13:4 You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him.
05Dt 13:5 But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05Dt 13:6 "If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' which neither you nor your fathers have known,
05Dt 13:7 some of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other,
05Dt 13:8 you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him.
05Dt 13:9 But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
05Dt 13:10 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05Dt 13:11 And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you.
05Dt 13:12 "If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to dwell there,
05Dt 13:13 that certain worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' which you have not known,
05Dt 13:14 then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you,
05Dt 13:15 you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.
05Dt 13:16 You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again.
05Dt 13:17 None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he swore to your fathers,
05Dt 13:18 if you obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 14:1 "You are the sons of the LORD your God. You shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead.
05Dt 14:2 For you are a people holy to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
05Dt 14:3 "You shall not eat any abomination.
05Dt 14:4 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05Dt 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
05Dt 14:6 Every animal that parts the hoof and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.
05Dt 14:7 Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cloven you shall not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not part the hoof, are unclean for you.
05Dt 14:8 And the pig, because it parts the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean for you. Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.
05Dt 14:9 "Of all that are in the waters you may eat these: whatever has fins and scales you may eat.
05Dt 14:10 And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
05Dt 14:11 "You may eat all clean birds.
05Dt 14:12 But these are the ones that you shall not eat: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
05Dt 14:13 the kite, the falcon of any kind;
05Dt 14:14 every raven of any kind;
05Dt 14:15 the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk of any kind;
05Dt 14:16 the little owl and the short-eared owl, the barn owl
05Dt 14:17 and the tawny owl, the carrion vulture and the cormorant,
05Dt 14:18 the stork, the heron of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat.
05Dt 14:19 And all winged insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.
05Dt 14:20 All clean winged things you may eat.
05Dt 14:21 "You shall not eat anything that has died naturally. You may give it to the sojourner who is within your towns, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. "You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
05Dt 14:22 "You shall tithe all the yield of your seed that comes from the field year by year.
05Dt 14:23 And before the LORD your God, in the place that he will choose, to make his name dwell there, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.
05Dt 14:24 And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry the tithe, when the LORD your God blesses you, because the place is too far from you, which the LORD your God chooses, to set his name there,
05Dt 14:25 then you shall turn it into money and bind up the money in your hand and go to the place that the LORD your God chooses
05Dt 14:26 and spend the money for whatever you desire--oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink, whatever your appetite craves. And you shall eat there before the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household.
05Dt 14:27 And you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your towns, for he has no portion or inheritance with you.
05Dt 14:28 "At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns.
05Dt 14:29 And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do.
05Dt 15:1 "At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release.
05Dt 15:2 And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release what he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother, because the LORD's release has been proclaimed.
05Dt 15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it, but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release.
05Dt 15:4 But there will be no poor among you; for the LORD will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess--
05Dt 15:5 if only you will strictly obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all this commandment that I command you today.
05Dt 15:6 For the LORD your God will bless you, as he promised you, and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow, and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.
05Dt 15:7 "If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother,
05Dt 15:8 but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.
05Dt 15:9 Take care lest there be an unworthy thought in your heart and you say, 'The seventh year, the year of release is near,' and your eye look grudgingly on your poor brother, and you give him nothing, and he cry to the LORD against you, and you be guilty of sin.
05Dt 15:10 You shall give to him freely, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake.
05Dt 15:11 For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.'
05Dt 15:12 "If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
05Dt 15:13 And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed.
05Dt 15:14 You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress. As the LORD your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
05Dt 15:15 You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today.
05Dt 15:16 But if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he is well-off with you,
05Dt 15:17 then you shall take an awl, and put it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your slave forever. And to your female slave you shall do the same.
05Dt 15:18 It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for at half the cost of a hired servant he has served you six years. So the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.
05Dt 15:19 "All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and flock you shall dedicate to the LORD your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
05Dt 15:20 You shall eat it, you and your household, before the LORD your God year by year at the place that the LORD will choose.
05Dt 15:21 But if it has any blemish, if it is lame or blind or has any serious blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
05Dt 15:22 You shall eat it within your towns. The unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as though it were a gazelle or a deer.
05Dt 15:23 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 16:1 "Observe the month of Abib and keep the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
05Dt 16:2 And you shall offer the Passover sacrifice to the LORD your God, from the flock or the herd, at the place that the LORD will choose, to make his name dwell there.
05Dt 16:3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it. Seven days you shall eat it with unleavened bread, the bread of affliction--for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste--that all the days of your life you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt.
05Dt 16:4 No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the flesh that you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain all night until morning.
05Dt 16:5 You may not offer the Passover sacrifice within any of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you,
05Dt 16:6 but at the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name dwell in it, there you shall offer the Passover sacrifice, in the evening at sunset, at the time you came out of Egypt.
05Dt 16:7 And you shall cook it and eat it at the place that the LORD your God will choose. And in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.
05Dt 16:8 For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God. You shall do no work on it.
05Dt 16:9 "You shall count seven weeks. Begin to count the seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain.
05Dt 16:10 Then you shall keep the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with the tribute of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give as the LORD your God blesses you.
05Dt 16:11 And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, the Levite who is within your towns, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow who are among you, at the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name dwell there.
05Dt 16:12 You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt; and you shall be careful to observe these statutes.
05Dt 16:13 "You shall keep the Feast of Booths seven days, when you have gathered in the produce from your threshing floor and your winepress.
05Dt 16:14 You shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your towns.
05Dt 16:15 For seven days you shall keep the feast to the LORD your God at the place that the LORD will choose, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you will be altogether joyful.
05Dt 16:16 "Three times a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths. They shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed.
05Dt 16:17 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you.
05Dt 16:18 "You shall appoint judges and officers in all your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
05Dt 16:19 You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous.
05Dt 16:20 Justice, and only justice, you shall follow, that you may live and inherit the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:21 "You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the LORD your God that you shall make.
05Dt 16:22 And you shall not set up a pillar, which the LORD your God hates.
05Dt 17:1 "You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep in which is a blemish, any defect whatever, for that is an abomination to the LORD your God.
05Dt 17:2 "If there is found among you, within any of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,
05Dt 17:3 and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden,
05Dt 17:4 and it is told you and you hear of it, then you shall inquire diligently, and if it is true and certain that such an abomination has been done in Israel,
05Dt 17:5 then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you shall stone that man or woman to death with stones.
05Dt 17:6 On the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die shall be put to death; a person shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.
05Dt 17:7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05Dt 17:8 "If any case arises requiring decision between one kind of homicide and another, one kind of legal right and another, or one kind of assault and another, any case within your towns that is too difficult for you, then you shall arise and go up to the place that the LORD your God will choose.
05Dt 17:9 And you shall come to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office in those days, and you shall consult them, and they shall declare to you the decision.
05Dt 17:10 Then you shall do according to what they declare to you from that place that the LORD will choose. And you shall be careful to do according to all that they direct you.
05Dt 17:11 According to the instructions that they give you, and according to the decision which they pronounce to you, you shall do. You shall not turn aside from the verdict that they declare to you, either to the right hand or to the left.
05Dt 17:12 The man who acts presumptuously by not obeying the priest who stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or the judge, that man shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 17:13 And all the people shall hear and fear and not act presumptuously again.
05Dt 17:14 "When you come to the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you possess it and dwell in it and then say, 'I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,'
05Dt 17:15 you may indeed set a king over you whom the LORD your God will choose. One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.
05Dt 17:16 Only he must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the LORD has said to you, 'You shall never return that way again.'
05Dt 17:17 And he shall not acquire many wives for himself, lest his heart turn away, nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold.
05Dt 17:18 "And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, approved by the Levitical priests.
05Dt 17:19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them,
05Dt 17:20 that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left, so that he may continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel.
05Dt 18:1 "The Levitical priests, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the LORD's food offerings as their inheritance.
05Dt 18:2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.
05Dt 18:3 And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.
05Dt 18:4 The firstfruits of your grain, of your wine and of your oil, and the first fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
05Dt 18:5 For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for all time.
05Dt 18:6 "And if a Levite comes from any of your towns out of all Israel, where he lives--and he may come when he desires--to the place that the LORD will choose,
05Dt 18:7 and ministers in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand to minister there before the LORD,
05Dt 18:8 then he may have equal portions to eat, besides what he receives from the sale of his patrimony.
05Dt 18:9 "When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations.
05Dt 18:10 There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer
05Dt 18:11 or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead,
05Dt 18:12 for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD. And because of these abominations the LORD your God is driving them out before you.
05Dt 18:13 You shall be blameless before the LORD your God,
05Dt 18:14 for these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do this.
05Dt 18:15 "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers--it is to him you shall listen--
05Dt 18:16 just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.'
05Dt 18:17 And the LORD said to me, 'They are right in what they have spoken.
05Dt 18:18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
05Dt 18:19 And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
05Dt 18:20 But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.'
05Dt 18:21 And if you say in your heart, 'How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?'--
05Dt 18:22 when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.
05Dt 19:1 "When the LORD your God cuts off the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses,
05Dt 19:2 you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:3 You shall measure the distances and divide into three parts the area of the land that the LORD your God gives you as a possession, so that any manslayer can flee to them.
05Dt 19:4 "This is the provision for the manslayer, who by fleeing there may save his life. If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past--
05Dt 19:5 as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies--he may flee to one of these cities and live,
05Dt 19:6 lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.
05Dt 19:7 Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities.
05Dt 19:8 And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers--
05Dt 19:9 provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways--then you shall add three other cities to these three,
05Dt 19:10 lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.
05Dt 19:11 "But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities,
05Dt 19:12 then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die.
05Dt 19:13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may be well with you.
05Dt 19:14 "You shall not move your neighbor's landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:15 "A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed. Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established.
05Dt 19:16 If a malicious witness arises to accuse a person of wrongdoing,
05Dt 19:17 then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days.
05Dt 19:18 The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely,
05Dt 19:19 then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05Dt 19:20 And the rest shall hear and fear, and shall never again commit any such evil among you.
05Dt 19:21 Your eye shall not pity. It shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
05Dt 20:1 "When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
05Dt 20:2 And when you draw near to the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people
05Dt 20:3 and shall say to them, 'Hear, O Israel, today you are drawing near for battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint. Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them,
05Dt 20:4 for the LORD your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.'
05Dt 20:5 Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, 'Is there any man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
05Dt 20:6 And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit.
05Dt 20:7 And is there any man who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.'
05Dt 20:8 And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, 'Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own.'
05Dt 20:9 And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, then commanders shall be appointed at the head of the people.
05Dt 20:10 "When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.
05Dt 20:11 And if it responds to you peaceably and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you.
05Dt 20:12 But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.
05Dt 20:13 And when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword,
05Dt 20:14 but the women and the little ones, the livestock, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as plunder for yourselves. And you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 20:15 Thus you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here.
05Dt 20:16 But in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes,
05Dt 20:17 but you shall devote them to complete destruction, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded,
05Dt 20:18 that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the LORD your God.
05Dt 20:19 "When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. You may eat from them, but you shall not cut them down. Are the trees in the field human, that they should be besieged by you?
05Dt 20:20 Only the trees that you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, that you may build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
05Dt 21:1 "If in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess someone is found slain, lying in the open country, and it is not known who killed him,
05Dt 21:2 then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure the distance to the surrounding cities.
05Dt 21:3 And the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer that has never been worked and that has not pulled in a yoke.
05Dt 21:4 And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
05Dt 21:5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the LORD, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled.
05Dt 21:6 And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
05Dt 21:7 and they shall testify, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed.
05Dt 21:8 Accept atonement, O LORD, for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and do not set the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel, so that their blood guilt be atoned for.'
05Dt 21:9 So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.
05Dt 21:10 "When you go out to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God gives them into your hand and you take them captive,
05Dt 21:11 and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire to take her to be your wife,
05Dt 21:12 and you bring her home to your house, she shall shave her head and pare her nails.
05Dt 21:13 And she shall take off the clothes in which she was captured and shall remain in your house and lament her father and her mother a full month. After that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
05Dt 21:14 But if you no longer delight in her, you shall let her go where she wants. But you shall not sell her for money, nor shall you treat her as a slave, since you have humiliated her.
05Dt 21:15 "If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him children, and if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved,
05Dt 21:16 then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the unloved, who is the firstborn,
05Dt 21:17 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the firstfruits of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his.
05Dt 21:18 "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them,
05Dt 21:19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives,
05Dt 21:20 and they shall say to the elders of his city, 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.'
05Dt 21:21 Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
05Dt 21:22 "And if a man has committed a crime punishable by death and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,
05Dt 21:23 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is cursed by God. You shall not defile your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance.
05Dt 22:1 "You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep going astray and ignore them. You shall take them back to your brother.
05Dt 22:2 And if he does not live near you and you do not know who he is, you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall stay with you until your brother seeks it. Then you shall restore it to him.
05Dt 22:3 And you shall do the same with his donkey or with his garment, or with any lost thing of your brother's, which he loses and you find; you may not ignore it.
05Dt 22:4 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way and ignore them. You shall help him to lift them up again.
05Dt 22:5 "A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.
05Dt 22:6 "If you come across a bird's nest in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young.
05Dt 22:7 You shall let the mother go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may go well with you, and that you may live long.
05Dt 22:8 "When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you may not bring the guilt of blood upon your house, if anyone should fall from it.
05Dt 22:9 "You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole yield be forfeited, the crop that you have sown and the yield of the vineyard.
05Dt 22:10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
05Dt 22:11 You shall not wear cloth of wool and linen mixed together.
05Dt 22:12 "You shall make yourself tassels on the four corners of the garment with which you cover yourself.
05Dt 22:13 "If any man takes a wife and goes in to her and then hates her
05Dt 22:14 and accuses her of misconduct and brings a bad name upon her, saying, 'I took this woman, and when I came near her, I did not find in her evidence of virginity,'
05Dt 22:15 then the father of the young woman and her mother shall take and bring out the evidence of her virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.
05Dt 22:16 And the father of the young woman shall say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man to marry, and he hates her;
05Dt 22:17 and behold, he has accused her of misconduct, saying, "I did not find in your daughter evidence of virginity." And yet this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread the cloak before the elders of the city.
05Dt 22:18 Then the elders of that city shall take the man and whip him,
05Dt 22:19 and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name upon a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife. He may not divorce her all his days.
05Dt 22:20 But if the thing is true, that evidence of virginity was not found in the young woman,
05Dt 22:21 then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done an outrageous thing in Israel by whoring in her father's house. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05Dt 22:22 "If a man is found lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 22:23 "If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her,
05Dt 22:24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor's wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05Dt 22:25 "But if in the open country a man meets a young woman who is betrothed, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.
05Dt 22:26 But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no offense punishable by death. For this case is like that of a man attacking and murdering his neighbor,
05Dt 22:27 because he met her in the open country, and though the betrothed young woman cried for help there was no one to rescue her.
05Dt 22:28 "If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found,
05Dt 22:29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.

05Dt 23:3 "No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of them may enter the assembly of the LORD forever,
05Dt 23:4 because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
05Dt 23:5 But the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam; instead the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loved you.
05Dt 23:6 You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity all your days forever.
05Dt 23:7 "You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land.

05Dt 23:13 And you shall have a trowel with your tools, and when you sit down outside, you shall dig a hole with it and turn back and cover up your excrement.
05Dt 23:14 Because the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you and to give up your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy, so that he may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.
05Dt 23:15 "You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you.
05Dt 23:16 He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.
05Dt 23:17 "None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute, and none of the sons of Israel shall be a cult prostitute.
05Dt 23:18 You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the wages of a dog into the house of the LORD your God in payment for any vow, for both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God.
05Dt 23:19 "You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest.
05Dt 23:20 You may charge a foreigner interest, but you may not charge your brother interest, that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 23:21 "If you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not delay fulfilling it, for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and you will be guilty of sin.

05Dt 24:2 and if she goes and becomes another man's wife,
05Dt 24:3 and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter man dies, who took her to be his wife,
05Dt 24:4 then her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination before the LORD. And you shall not bring sin upon the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance.

05Dt 26:3 And you shall go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him, 'I declare today to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.'

05Dt 26:13 then you shall say before the LORD your God, 'I have removed the sacred portion out of my house, and moreover, I have given it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all your commandment that you have commanded me. I have not transgressed any of your commandments, nor have I forgotten them.

05Dt 26:17 You have declared today that the LORD is your God, and that you will walk in his ways, and keep his statutes and his commandments and his rules, and will obey his voice.
05Dt 26:18 And the LORD has declared today that you are a people for his treasured possession, as he has promised you, and that you are to keep all his commandments,
05Dt 26:19 and that he will set you in praise and in fame and in honor high above all nations that he has made, and that you shall be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised."
05Dt 27:1 Now Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, "Keep the whole commandment that I command you today.
05Dt 27:2 And on the day you cross over the Jordan to the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones and plaster them with plaster.
05Dt 27:3 And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you cross over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
05Dt 27:4 And when you have crossed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, concerning which I command you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
05Dt 27:5 And there you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You shall wield no iron tool on them;
05Dt 27:6 you shall build an altar to the LORD your God of uncut stones. And you shall offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God,
05Dt 27:7 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and shall eat there, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God.
05Dt 27:8 And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly."
05Dt 27:9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, "Keep silence and hear, O Israel: this day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
05Dt 27:10 You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping his commandments and his statutes, which I command you today."
05Dt 27:11 That day Moses charged the people, saying,
05Dt 27:12 "When you have crossed over the Jordan, these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
05Dt 27:13 And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
05Dt 27:14 And the Levites shall declare to all the men of Israel in a loud voice:
05Dt 27:15 "'Cursed be the man who makes a carved or cast metal image, an abomination to the LORD, a thing made by the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'
05Dt 27:16 "'Cursed be anyone who dishonors his father or his mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05Dt 27:17 "'Cursed be anyone who moves his neighbor's landmark.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

05Dt 27:26 "'Cursed be anyone who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05Dt 28:1 "And if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all his commandments that I command you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
05Dt 28:2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of the LORD your God.

05Dt 28:4 Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock.
05Dt 28:5 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
05Dt 28:6 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
05Dt 28:7 "The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you. They shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.
05Dt 28:8 The LORD will command the blessing on you in your barns and in all that you undertake. And he will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 28:9 The LORD will establish you as a people holy to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in his ways.
05Dt 28:10 And all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they shall be afraid of you.
05Dt 28:11 And the LORD will make you abound in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground, within the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
05Dt 28:12 The LORD will open to you his good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hands. And you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.
05Dt 28:13 And the LORD will make you the head and not the tail, and you shall only go up and not down, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you today, being careful to do them,
05Dt 28:14 and if you do not turn aside from any of the words that I command you today, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
05Dt 28:15 "But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD your God or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes that I command you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you.
05Dt 28:16 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
05Dt 28:17 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
05Dt 28:18 Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock.
05Dt 28:19 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
05Dt 28:20 "The LORD will send on you curses, confusion, and frustration in all that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken me.
05Dt 28:21 The LORD will make the pestilence stick to you until he has consumed you off the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 28:22 The LORD will strike you with wasting disease and with fever, inflammation and fiery heat, and with drought and with blight and with mildew. They shall pursue you until you perish.
05Dt 28:23 And the heavens over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you shall be iron.
05Dt 28:24 The LORD will make the rain of your land powder. From heaven dust shall come down on you until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:25 "The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them. And you shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
05Dt 28:26 And your dead body shall be food for all birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away.
05Dt 28:27 The LORD will strike you with the boils of Egypt, and with tumors and scabs and itch, of which you cannot be healed.
05Dt 28:28 The LORD will strike you with madness and blindness and confusion of mind,
05Dt 28:29 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind grope in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. And you shall be only oppressed and robbed continually, and there shall be no one to help you.
05Dt 28:30 You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall ravish her. You shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but you shall not enjoy its fruit.
05Dt 28:31 Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat any of it. Your donkey shall be seized before your face, but shall not be restored to you. Your sheep shall be given to your enemies, but there shall be no one to help you.
05Dt 28:32 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all day long, but you shall be helpless.
05Dt 28:33 A nation that you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors, and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually,
05Dt 28:34 so that you are driven mad by the sights that your eyes see.
05Dt 28:35 The LORD will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
05Dt 28:36 "The LORD will bring you and your king whom you set over you to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone.
05Dt 28:37 And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where the LORD will lead you away.
05Dt 28:38 You shall carry much seed into the field and shall gather in little, for the locust shall consume it.
05Dt 28:39 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them.
05Dt 28:40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives shall drop off.
05Dt 28:41 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours, for they shall go into captivity.
05Dt 28:42 The cricket shall possess all your trees and the fruit of your ground.
05Dt 28:43 The sojourner who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower.
05Dt 28:44 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him. He shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
05Dt 28:45 "All these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you.
05Dt 28:46 They shall be a sign and a wonder against you and your offspring forever.
05Dt 28:47 Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart, because of the abundance of all things,
05Dt 28:48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness, and lacking everything. And he will put a yoke of iron on your neck until he has destroyed you.
05Dt 28:49 The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, swooping down like the eagle, a nation whose language you do not understand,
05Dt 28:50 a hard-faced nation who shall not respect the old or show mercy to the young.
05Dt 28:51 It shall eat the offspring of your cattle and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; it also shall not leave you grain, wine, or oil, the increase of your herds or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
05Dt 28:52 "They shall besiege you in all your towns, until your high and fortified walls, in which you trusted, come down throughout all your land. And they shall besiege you in all your towns throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 28:53 And you shall eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your sons and daughters, whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you.
05Dt 28:54 The man who is the most tender and refined among you will begrudge food to his brother, to the wife he embraces, and to the last of the children whom he has left,
05Dt 28:55 so that he will not give to any of them any of the flesh of his children whom he is eating, because he has nothing else left, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your towns.
05Dt 28:56 The most tender and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because she is so delicate and tender, will begrudge to the husband she embraces, to her son and to her daughter,
05Dt 28:57 her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears, because lacking everything she will eat them secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your towns.
05Dt 28:58 "If you are not careful to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the LORD your God,
05Dt 28:59 then the LORD will bring on you and your offspring extraordinary afflictions, afflictions severe and lasting, and sicknesses grievous and lasting.
05Dt 28:60 And he will bring upon you again all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cling to you.
05Dt 28:61 Every sickness also and every affliction that is not recorded in the book of this law, the LORD will bring upon you, until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:62 Whereas you were as numerous as the stars of heaven, you shall be left few in number, because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
05Dt 28:63 And as the LORD took delight in doing you good and multiplying you, so the LORD will take delight in bringing ruin upon you and destroying you. And you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 28:64 "And the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
05Dt 28:65 And among these nations you shall find no respite, and there shall be no resting place for the sole of your foot, but the LORD will give you there a trembling heart and failing eyes and a languishing soul.
05Dt 28:66 Your life shall hang in doubt before you. Night and day you shall be in dread and have no assurance of your life.
05Dt 28:67 In the morning you shall say, 'If only it were evening!' and at evening you shall say, 'If only it were morning!' because of the dread that your heart shall feel, and the sights that your eyes shall see.
05Dt 28:68 And the LORD will bring you back in ships to Egypt, a journey that I promised that you should never make again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer."
05Dt 29:1  These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant that he had made with them at Horeb.
05Dt 29:2  And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: "You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
05Dt 29:3 the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.
05Dt 29:4 But to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear.
05Dt 29:5 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet.
05Dt 29:6 You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
05Dt 29:7 And when you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, but we defeated them.
05Dt 29:8 We took their land and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites.
05Dt 29:9 Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
05Dt 29:10 "You are standing today all of you before the LORD your God: the heads of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,
05Dt 29:11 your little ones, your wives, and the sojourner who is in your camp, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
05Dt 29:12 so that you may enter into the sworn covenant of the LORD your God, which the LORD your God is making with you today,
05Dt 29:13 that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he promised you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
05Dt 29:14 It is not with you alone that I am making this sworn covenant,
05Dt 29:15 but with whoever is standing here with us today before the LORD our God, and with whoever is not here with us today.
05Dt 29:16 "You know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed.
05Dt 29:17 And you have seen their detestable things, their idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold, which were among them.
05Dt 29:18 Beware lest there be among you a man or woman or clan or tribe whose heart is turning away today from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit,
05Dt 29:19 one who, when he hears the words of this sworn covenant, blesses himself in his heart, saying, 'I shall be safe, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.' This will lead to the sweeping away of moist and dry alike.
05Dt 29:20 The LORD will not be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and the curses written in this book will settle upon him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.
05Dt 29:21 And the LORD will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
05Dt 29:22 And the next generation, your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, will say, when they see the afflictions of that land and the sicknesses with which the LORD has made it sick--
05Dt 29:23 the whole land burned out with brimstone and salt, nothing sown and nothing growing, where no plant can sprout, an overthrow like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and wrath--
05Dt 29:24 all the nations will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land? What caused the heat of this great anger?'
05Dt 29:25 Then people will say, 'It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,
05Dt 29:26 and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them.
05Dt 29:27 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, bringing upon it all the curses written in this book,
05Dt 29:28 and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and fury and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as they are this day.'
05Dt 29:29 "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
05Dt 30:1 "And when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you,
05Dt 30:2 and return to the LORD your God, you and your children, and obey his voice in all that I command you today, with all your heart and with all your soul,
05Dt 30:3 then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, and he will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.
05Dt 30:4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there he will take you.
05Dt 30:5 And the LORD your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, that you may possess it. And he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.
05Dt 30:6 And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
05Dt 30:7 And the LORD your God will put all these curses on your foes and enemies who persecuted you.
05Dt 30:8 And you shall again obey the voice of the LORD and keep all his commandments that I command you today.
05Dt 30:9 The LORD your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your cattle and in the fruit of your ground. For the LORD will again take delight in prospering you, as he took delight in your fathers,
05Dt 30:10 when you obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, when you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 30:11 "For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.
05Dt 30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
05Dt 30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
05Dt 30:14 But the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.
05Dt 30:15 "See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.
05Dt 30:16 If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,
05Dt 30:18 I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.
05Dt 30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,
05Dt 30:20 loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them."
05Dt 31:1 So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel.
05Dt 31:2 And he said to them, "I am 120 years old today. I am no longer able to go out and come in. The LORD has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.'
05Dt 31:3 The LORD your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, so that you shall dispossess them, and Joshua will go over at your head, as the LORD has spoken.
05Dt 31:4 And the LORD will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them.
05Dt 31:5 And the LORD will give them over to you, and you shall do to them according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you.
05Dt 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you."
05Dt 31:7 Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall put them in possession of it.
05Dt 31:8 It is the LORD who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed."
05Dt 31:9 Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
05Dt 31:10 And Moses commanded them, "At the end of every seven years, at the set time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths,
05Dt 31:11 when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
05Dt 31:12 Assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, and the sojourner within your towns, that they may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, and be careful to do all the words of this law,
05Dt 31:13 and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 31:14 And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the days approach when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
05Dt 31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent.
05Dt 31:16 And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them.
05Dt 31:17 Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. And many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, 'Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?'
05Dt 31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done, because they have turned to other gods.
05Dt 31:19 "Now therefore write this song and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel.
05Dt 31:20 For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, and despise me and break my covenant.
05Dt 31:21 And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give."
05Dt 31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.
05Dt 31:23 And the LORD commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them. I will be with you."
05Dt 31:24 When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book to the very end,
05Dt 31:25 Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
05Dt 31:26 "Take this Book of the Law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
05Dt 31:27 For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Behold, even today while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the LORD. How much more after my death!
05Dt 31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
05Dt 31:29 For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands."
05Dt 31:30 Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:
05Dt 32:1 "Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
05Dt 32:2 May my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, like gentle rain upon the tender grass, and like showers upon the herb.
05Dt 32:3 For I will proclaim the name of the LORD; ascribe greatness to our God!
05Dt 32:4 "The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is he.
05Dt 32:5 They have dealt corruptly with him; they are no longer his children because they are blemished; they are a crooked and twisted generation.
05Dt 32:6 Do you thus repay the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?
05Dt 32:7 Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you, your elders, and they will tell you.
05Dt 32:8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.
05Dt 32:9 But the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted heritage.
05Dt 32:10 "He found him in a desert land, and in the howling waste of the wilderness; he encircled him, he cared for him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
05Dt 32:11 Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that flutters over its young, spreading out its wings, catching them, bearing them on its pinions,
05Dt 32:12 the LORD alone guided him, no foreign god was with him.
05Dt 32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the land, and he ate the produce of the field, and he suckled him with honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.
05Dt 32:14 Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of Bashan and goats, with the very finest of the wheat-- and you drank foaming wine made from the blood of the grape.
05Dt 32:15 "But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked; you grew fat, stout, and sleek; then he forsook God who made him and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.
05Dt 32:16 They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked him to anger.
05Dt 32:17 They sacrificed to demons that were no gods, to gods they had never known, to new gods that had come recently, whom your fathers had never dreaded.
05Dt 32:18 You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you, and you forgot the God who gave you birth.
05Dt 32:19 "The LORD saw it and spurned them, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
05Dt 32:20 And he said, 'I will hide my face from them; I will see what their end will be, For they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
05Dt 32:21 They have made me jealous with what is no god; they have provoked me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are no people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
05Dt 32:22 For a fire is kindled by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
05Dt 32:23 "'And I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend my arrows on them;
05Dt 32:24 they shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured by plague and poisonous pestilence; I will send the teeth of beasts against them, with the venom of things that crawl in the dust.
05Dt 32:25 Outdoors the sword shall bereave, and indoors terror, for young man and woman alike, the nursing child with the man of gray hairs.
05Dt 32:26 I would have said, "I will cut them to pieces; I will wipe them from human memory,"
05Dt 32:27 had I not feared provocation by the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, "Our hand is triumphant, it was not the LORD who did all this."'
05Dt 32:28 "For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no understanding in them.
05Dt 32:29 If they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern their latter end!
05Dt 32:30 How could one have chased a thousand, and two have put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had given them up?
05Dt 32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock; our enemies are by themselves.
05Dt 32:32 For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison; their clusters are bitter;
05Dt 32:33 their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps.
05Dt 32:34 "'Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?
05Dt 32:35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and their doom comes swiftly.'
05Dt 32:36 For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone and there is none remaining, bond or free.
05Dt 32:37 Then he will say, 'Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
05Dt 32:38 who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection!
05Dt 32:39 "'See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
05Dt 32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven and swear, As I live forever,
05Dt 32:41 if I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and will repay those who hate me.
05Dt 32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh-- with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired heads of the enemy.'
05Dt 32:43 "Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people's land."
05Dt 32:44 Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
05Dt 32:45 And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
05Dt 32:46 he said to them, "Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law.
05Dt 32:47 For it is no empty word for you, but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 32:48 That very day the LORD spoke to Moses,
05Dt 32:49 "Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel for a possession.
05Dt 32:50 And die on the mountain which you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
05Dt 32:51 because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel.
05Dt 32:52 For you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel."
05Dt 33:1 This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the people of Israel before his death.
05Dt 33:2 He said, "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand.
05Dt 33:3 Yes, he loved his people, all his holy ones were in his hand; so they followed in your steps, receiving direction from you,
05Dt 33:4 when Moses commanded us a law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
05Dt 33:5 Thus the LORD became king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.
05Dt 33:6 "Let Reuben live, and not die, but let his men be few."
05Dt 33:7 And this he said of Judah: "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him in to his people. With your hands contend for him, and be a help against his adversaries."
05Dt 33:8 And of Levi he said, "Give to Levi your Thummim, and your Urim to your godly one, whom you tested at Massah, with whom you quarreled at the waters of Meribah;
05Dt 33:9 who said of his father and mother, 'I regard them not'; he disowned his brothers and ignored his children. For they observed your word and kept your covenant.
05Dt 33:10 They shall teach Jacob your rules and Israel your law; they shall put incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
05Dt 33:11 Bless, O LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those who hate him, that they rise not again."
05Dt 33:12 Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of the LORD dwells in safety. The High God surrounds him all day long, and dwells between his shoulders."
05Dt 33:13 And of Joseph he said, "Blessed by the LORD be his land, with the choicest gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that crouches beneath,
05Dt 33:14 with the choicest fruits of the sun and the rich yield of the months,
05Dt 33:15 with the finest produce of the ancient mountains and the abundance of the everlasting hills,
05Dt 33:16 with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwells in the bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph, on the pate of him who is prince among his brothers.
05Dt 33:17 A firstborn bull--he has majesty, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he shall gore the peoples, all of them, to the ends of the earth; they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh."
05Dt 33:18 And of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar, in your tents.
05Dt 33:19 They shall call peoples to their mountain; there they offer right sacrifices; for they draw from the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand."
05Dt 33:20 And of Gad he said, "Blessed be he who enlarges Gad! Gad crouches like a lion; he tears off arm and scalp.
05Dt 33:21 He chose the best of the land for himself, for there a commander's portion was reserved; and he came with the heads of the people, with Israel he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments for Israel."
05Dt 33:22 And of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps from Bashan."
05Dt 33:23 And of Naphtali he said, "O Naphtali, sated with favor, and full of the blessing of the LORD, possess the lake and the south."
05Dt 33:24 And of Asher he said, "Most blessed of sons be Asher; let him be the favorite of his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
05Dt 33:25 Your bars shall be iron and bronze, and as your days, so shall your strength be.
05Dt 33:26 "There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your help, through the skies in his majesty.
05Dt 33:27 The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy before you and said, Destroy.
05Dt 33:28 So Israel lived in safety, Jacob lived alone, in a land of grain and wine, whose heavens drop down dew.
05Dt 33:29 Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you, and you shall tread upon their backs."
05Dt 34:1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,
05Dt 34:2 all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
05Dt 34:3 the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the Valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
05Dt 34:4 And the LORD said to him, "This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, 'I will give it to your offspring.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
05Dt 34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD,
05Dt 34:6 and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no one knows the place of his burial to this day.
05Dt 34:7 Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eye was undimmed, and his vigor unabated.
05Dt 34:8 And the people of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
05Dt 34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
05Dt 34:10 And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
05Dt 34:11 none like him for all the signs and the wonders that the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
05Dt 34:12 and for all the mighty power and all the great deeds of terror that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
06
06Jos 1:1 After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' assistant,
06Jos 1:2 "Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.
06Jos 1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses.
06Jos 1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.
06Jos 1:5 No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you.
06Jos 1:6 Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.
06Jos 1:7 Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.
06Jos 1:8 This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.
06Jos 1:9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
06Jos 1:10 And Joshua commanded the officers of the people,
06Jos 1:11 "Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, 'Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.'"
06Jos 1:12 And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,
06Jos 1:13 "Remember the word that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.'
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them,
06Jos 1:15 until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."
06Jos 1:16 And they answered Joshua, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
06Jos 1:17 Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses!
06Jos 1:18 Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
06Jos 2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and lodged there.
06Jos 2:2 And it was told to the king of Jericho, "Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land."
06Jos 2:3 Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land."
06Jos 2:4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, "True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
06Jos 2:5 And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them."
06Jos 2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof.
06Jos 2:7 So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.
06Jos 2:8 Before the men lay down, she came up to them on the roof
06Jos 2:9 and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
06Jos 2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction.
06Jos 2:11 And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the LORD your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.
06Jos 2:12 Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a sure sign
06Jos 2:13 that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."
06Jos 2:14 And the men said to her, "Our life for yours even to death! If you do not tell this business of ours, then when the LORD gives us the land we will deal kindly and faithfully with you."
06Jos 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall.
06Jos 2:16 And she said to them, "Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned. Then afterward you may go your way."
06Jos 2:17 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear.
06Jos 2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
06Jos 2:19 Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be guiltless. But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head.
06Jos 2:20 But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear."
06Jos 2:21 And she said, "According to your words, so be it." Then she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
06Jos 2:22 They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing.
06Jos 2:23 Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them.
06Jos 2:24 And they said to Joshua, "Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away because of us."
06Jos 3:1 Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Shittim. And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
06Jos 3:2 At the end of three days the officers went through the camp
06Jos 3:3 and commanded the people, "As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it.
06Jos 3:4 Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before."
06Jos 3:5 Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
06Jos 3:6 And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
06Jos 3:7 The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
06Jos 3:8 And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
06Jos 3:9 And Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God."
06Jos 3:10 And Joshua said, "Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
06Jos 3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into the Jordan.
06Jos 3:12 Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man.
06Jos 3:13 And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap."
06Jos 3:14 So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
06Jos 3:15 and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest),
06Jos 3:16 the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho.
06Jos 3:17 Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.
06Jos 4:1 When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:2 "Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man,
06Jos 4:3 and command them, saying, 'Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests' feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.'"
06Jos 4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe.
06Jos 4:5 And Joshua said to them, "Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel,
06Jos 4:6 that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, 'What do those stones mean to you?'
06Jos 4:7 then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever."
06Jos 4:8 And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the LORD told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there.
06Jos 4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.
06Jos 4:10 For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people passed over in haste.
06Jos 4:11 And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people.
06Jos 4:12 The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them.
06Jos 4:13 About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho.
06Jos 4:14 On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.
06Jos 4:15 And the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:16 "Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan."
06Jos 4:17 So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
06Jos 4:18 And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.
06Jos 4:19 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
06Jos 4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
06Jos 4:21 And he said to the people of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in times to come, 'What do these stones mean?'
06Jos 4:22 then you shall let your children know, 'Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.'
06Jos 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over,
06Jos 4:24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever."
06Jos 5:1 As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.
06Jos 5:2 At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time."
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
06Jos 5:4 And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt.
06Jos 5:5 Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
06Jos 5:6 For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06Jos 5:7 So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
06Jos 5:8 When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
06Jos 5:9 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
06Jos 5:10 While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
06Jos 5:11 And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
06Jos 5:12 And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
06Jos 5:13 When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
06Jos 5:14 And he said, "No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD. Now I have come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
06Jos 5:15 And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
06Jos 6:1 Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in.
06Jos 6:2 And the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor.
06Jos 6:3 You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days.
06Jos 6:4 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
06Jos 6:5 And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him."
06Jos 6:6 So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:7 And he said to the people, "Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:8 And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.
06Jos 6:9 The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.
06Jos 6:10 But Joshua commanded the people, "You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."
06Jos 6:11 So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.
06Jos 6:12 Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
06Jos 6:13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually.
06Jos 6:14 And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.
06Jos 6:15 On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
06Jos 6:16 And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for the LORD has given you the city.
06Jos 6:17 And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
06Jos 6:18 But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it.
06Jos 6:19 But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."
06Jos 6:20 So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
06Jos 6:21 Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.
06Jos 6:22 But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her."
06Jos 6:23 So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:24 And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
06Jos 6:25 But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
06Jos 6:26 Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. "At the cost of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
06Jos 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
06Jos 7:1 But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.
06Jos 7:2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men went up and spied out Ai.
06Jos 7:3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few."
06Jos 7:4 So about 3,000 men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai,
06Jos 7:5 and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
06Jos 7:6 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads.
06Jos 7:7 And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
06Jos 7:8 O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
06Jos 7:9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?"
06Jos 7:10 The LORD said to Joshua, "Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings.
06Jos 7:12 Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
06Jos 7:13 Get up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, "There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you."
06Jos 7:14 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
06Jos 7:15 And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.'"
06Jos 7:16 So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
06Jos 7:17 And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
06Jos 7:18 And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
06Jos 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."
06Jos 7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, "Truly I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:
06Jos 7:21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
06Jos 7:23 And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the LORD.
06Jos 7:24 And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
06Jos 7:25 And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
06Jos 7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.
06Jos 8:1 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land.
06Jos 8:2 And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it."
06Jos 8:3 So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.
06Jos 8:4 And he commanded them, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready.
06Jos 8:5 And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them.
06Jos 8:6 And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, just as before.' So we will flee before them.
06Jos 8:7 Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.
06Jos 8:8 And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you."
06Jos 8:9 So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.
06Jos 8:10 Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
06Jos 8:11 And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.
06Jos 8:12 He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
06Jos 8:13 So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.
06Jos 8:14 And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
06Jos 8:15 And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
06Jos 8:16 So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.
06Jos 8:17 Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.
06Jos 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
06Jos 8:19 And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire.
06Jos 8:20 So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.
06Jos 8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
06Jos 8:22 And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped.
06Jos 8:23 But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.
06Jos 8:24 When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword.
06Jos 8:25 And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai.
06Jos 8:26 But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.
06Jos 8:27 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the LORD that he commanded Joshua.
06Jos 8:28 So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.
06Jos 8:29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
06Jos 8:30 At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
06Jos 8:31 just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, "an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool." And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings.
06Jos 8:32 And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
06Jos 8:33 And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel.
06Jos 8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.
06Jos 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.
06Jos 9:1 As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this,
06Jos 9:2 they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.
06Jos 9:3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
06Jos 9:4 they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,
06Jos 9:5 with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly.
06Jos 9:6 And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us."
06Jos 9:7 But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?"
06Jos 9:8 They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?"
06Jos 9:9 They said to him, "From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
06Jos 9:10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
06Jos 9:11 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us."'
06Jos 9:12 Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly.
06Jos 9:13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey."
06Jos 9:14 So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the LORD.
06Jos 9:15 And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
06Jos 9:16 At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them.
06Jos 9:17 And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
06Jos 9:18 But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.
06Jos 9:19 But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.
06Jos 9:20 This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them."
06Jos 9:21 And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.
06Jos 9:22 Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?
06Jos 9:23 Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
06Jos 9:24 They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you--so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing.
06Jos 9:25 And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it."
06Jos 9:26 So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them.
06Jos 9:27 But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that he should choose.
06Jos 10:1 As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
06Jos 10:2 he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
06Jos 10:3 So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
06Jos 10:4 "Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel."
06Jos 10:5 Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.
06Jos 10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us."
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
06Jos 10:8 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you."
06Jos 10:9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.
06Jos 10:10 And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
06Jos 10:11 And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
06Jos 10:12 At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon."
06Jos 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.
06Jos 10:14 There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.
06Jos 10:15 So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 10:16 These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
06Jos 10:17 And it was told to Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
06Jos 10:18 And Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them,
06Jos 10:19 but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
06Jos 10:20 When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
06Jos 10:21 then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.
06Jos 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave."
06Jos 10:23 And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
06Jos 10:24 And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings." Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.
06Jos 10:25 And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight."
06Jos 10:26 And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening.
06Jos 10:27 But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
06Jos 10:28 As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:29 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
06Jos 10:30 And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:31 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it.
06Jos 10:32 And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.
06Jos 10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.
06Jos 10:34 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it.
06Jos 10:35 And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.
06Jos 10:36 Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it
06Jos 10:37 and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.
06Jos 10:38 Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it
06Jos 10:39 and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.
06Jos 10:40 So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
06Jos 10:41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.
06Jos 10:42 And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
06Jos 10:43 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 11:1 When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
06Jos 11:2 and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west,
06Jos 11:3 to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
06Jos 11:4 And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
06Jos 11:5 And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
06Jos 11:6 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them.
06Jos 11:8 And the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining.
06Jos 11:9 And Joshua did to them just as the LORD said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
06Jos 11:10 And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.
06Jos 11:11 And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
06Jos 11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
06Jos 11:13 But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned.
06Jos 11:14 And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every man they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.
06Jos 11:15 Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland
06Jos 11:17 from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death.
06Jos 11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
06Jos 11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.
06Jos 11:20 For it was the LORD's doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the LORD commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:21 And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities.
06Jos 11:22 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain.
06Jos 11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.
06Jos 12:1 Now these are the kings of the land whom the people of Israel defeated and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, with all the Arabah eastward:
06Jos 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the middle of the valley as far as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites, that is, half of Gilead,
06Jos 12:3 and the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
06Jos 12:4 and Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
06Jos 12:5 and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and over half of Gilead to the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon.
06Jos 12:6 Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the people of Israel defeated them. And Moses the servant of the LORD gave their land for a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 12:7 And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the people of Israel defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir (and Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their allotments,
06Jos 12:8 in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negeb, the land of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites):
06Jos 12:9 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
06Jos 12:10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

06Jos 12:23 the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one; the king of Goiim in Galilee, one;
06Jos 12:24 the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.
06Jos 13:1 Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to possess.
06Jos 13:2 This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites
06Jos 13:3 (from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, it is counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of the Avvim,
06Jos 13:4 in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites,
06Jos 13:5 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath,
06Jos 13:6 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel. Only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
06Jos 13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh."
06Jos 13:8 With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them:
06Jos 13:9 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon;
06Jos 13:10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
06Jos 13:11 and Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
06Jos 13:12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); these Moses had struck and driven out.
06Jos 13:13 Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
06Jos 13:14 To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance. The offerings by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to him.
06Jos 13:15 And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans.
06Jos 13:16 So their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba;
06Jos 13:17 with Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
06Jos 13:18 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
06Jos 13:19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
06Jos 13:20 and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
06Jos 13:21 that is, all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
06Jos 13:22 Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain.
06Jos 13:23 And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their clans with their cities and villages.
06Jos 13:24 Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their clans.
06Jos 13:25 Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah,
06Jos 13:26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir,
06Jos 13:27 and in the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, having the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan.
06Jos 13:28 This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans, with their cities and villages.
06Jos 13:29 And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was allotted to the half-tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans.
06Jos 13:30 Their region extended from Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities,
06Jos 13:31 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were allotted to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the people of Machir according to their clans.
06Jos 13:32 These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
06Jos 13:33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he said to them.
06Jos 14:1 These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit.
06Jos 14:2 Their inheritance was by lot, just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes.
06Jos 14:3 For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
06Jos 14:4 For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance.
06Jos 14:5 The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.
06Jos 14:6 Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me.
06Jos 14:7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
06Jos 14:8 But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God.
06Jos 14:9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.'
06Jos 14:10 And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
06Jos 14:11 I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming.
06Jos 14:12 So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said."
06Jos 14:13 Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
06Jos 14:14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 14:15 Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war.
06Jos 15:1 The allotment for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans reached southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south.
06Jos 15:2 And their south boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
06Jos 15:3 It goes out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, turns about to Karka,
06Jos 15:4 passes along to Azmon, goes out by the Brook of Egypt, and comes to its end at the sea. This shall be your south boundary.
06Jos 15:5 And the east boundary is the Salt Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
06Jos 15:6 And the boundary goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes along north of Beth-arabah. And the boundary goes up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
06Jos 15:7 And the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. And the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel.
06Jos 15:8 Then the boundary goes up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem). And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
06Jos 15:9 Then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the boundary bends around to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
06Jos 15:10 And the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh and passes along by Timnah.
06Jos 15:11 The boundary goes out to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends around to Shikkeron and passes along to Mount Baalah and goes out to Jabneel. Then the boundary comes to an end at the sea.
06Jos 15:12 And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans.
06Jos 15:13 According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).
06Jos 15:14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
06Jos 15:15 And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
06Jos 15:16 And Caleb said, "Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife."
06Jos 15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
06Jos 15:18 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
06Jos 15:19 She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
06Jos 15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans.
06Jos 15:21 The cities belonging to the tribe of the people of Judah in the extreme south, toward the boundary of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
06Jos 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
06Jos 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
06Jos 15:24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
06Jos 15:25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
06Jos 15:26 Amam, Shema, Moladah,
06Jos 15:27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
06Jos 15:28 Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,
06Jos 15:29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
06Jos 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
06Jos 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
06Jos 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:33 And in the lowland, Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
06Jos 15:34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
06Jos 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
06Jos 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, Gederothaim: fourteen cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:37 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
06Jos 15:38 Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel,
06Jos 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
06Jos 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish,
06Jos 15:41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:42 Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
06Jos 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
06Jos 15:44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:45 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
06Jos 15:46 from Ekron to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
06Jos 15:47 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the Brook of Egypt, and the Great Sea with its coastline.
06Jos 15:48 And in the hill country, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06Jos 15:53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior: nine cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:58 Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon: six cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:60 Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah: two cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:61 In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and Engedi: six cities with their villages.
06Jos 15:63 But the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah could not drive out, so the Jebusites dwell with the people of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
06Jos 16:1 The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel.
06Jos 16:2 Then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites.
06Jos 16:3 Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.
06Jos 16:4 The people of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
06Jos 16:5 The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon,
06Jos 16:6 and the boundary goes from there to the sea. On the north is Michmethath. Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah,
06Jos 16:7 then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan.
06Jos 16:8 From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Ephraim by their clans,
06Jos 16:9 together with the towns that were set apart for the people of Ephraim within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages.
06Jos 16:10 However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor.
06Jos 17:1 Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
06Jos 17:2 And allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.
06Jos 17:3 Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
06Jos 17:4 They approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers." So according to the mouth of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
06Jos 17:5 Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan,
06Jos 17:6 because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.
06Jos 17:7 The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
06Jos 17:8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim.
06Jos 17:9 Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea,
06Jos 17:10 the land to the south being Ephraim's and that to the north being Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar.
06Jos 17:11 Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath.
06Jos 17:12 Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
06Jos 17:13 Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
06Jos 17:14 Then the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since all along the LORD has blessed me?"
06Jos 17:15 And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
06Jos 17:16 The people of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us. Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel."
06Jos 17:17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only,
06Jos 17:18 but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
06Jos 18:1 Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land lay subdued before them.
06Jos 18:2 There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned.
06Jos 18:3 So Joshua said to the people of Israel, "How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
06Jos 18:4 Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me.
06Jos 18:5 They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall continue in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north.
06Jos 18:6 And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
06Jos 18:7 The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
06Jos 18:8 So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, "Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
06Jos 18:9 So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions. Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh,
06Jos 18:10 and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel, to each his portion.
06Jos 18:11 The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph.
06Jos 18:12 On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan. Then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho, then up through the hill country westward, and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
06Jos 18:13 From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (that is, Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.
06Jos 18:14 Then the boundary goes in another direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city belonging to the people of Judah. This forms the western side.
06Jos 18:15 And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. And the boundary goes from there to Ephron, to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
06Jos 18:16 Then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. And it then goes down the Valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel.
06Jos 18:17 Then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and from there goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. Then it goes down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
06Jos 18:18 and passing on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-arabah it goes down to the Arabah.
06Jos 18:19 Then the boundary passes on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-hoglah. And the boundary ends at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this is the southern border.
06Jos 18:20 The Jordan forms its boundary on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin, according to their clans, boundary by boundary all around.
06Jos 18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to their clans were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
06Jos 18:22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
06Jos 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
06Jos 18:24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, Geba--twelve cities with their villages:
06Jos 18:25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
06Jos 18:26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
06Jos 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
06Jos 18:28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath-jearim--fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin according to its clans.
06Jos 19:1 The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the people of Simeon, according to their clans, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the people of Judah.
06Jos 19:2 And they had for their inheritance Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah,
06Jos 19:3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
06Jos 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
06Jos 19:5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
06Jos 19:6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen--thirteen cities with their villages;
06Jos 19:7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan--four cities with their villages,
06Jos 19:8 together with all the villages around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negeb. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Simeon according to their clans.
06Jos 19:9 The inheritance of the people of Simeon formed part of the territory of the people of Judah. Because the portion of the people of Judah was too large for them, the people of Simeon obtained an inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
06Jos 19:10 The third lot came up for the people of Zebulun, according to their clans. And the territory of their inheritance reached as far as Sarid.
06Jos 19:11 Then their boundary goes up westward and on to Mareal and touches Dabbesheth, then the brook that is east of Jokneam.
06Jos 19:12 From Sarid it goes in the other direction eastward toward the sunrise to the boundary of Chisloth-tabor. From there it goes to Daberath, then up to Japhia.
06Jos 19:13 From there it passes along on the east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and going on to Rimmon it bends toward Neah,
06Jos 19:14 then on the north the boundary turns about to Hannathon, and it ends at the Valley of Iphtahel;
06Jos 19:15 and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem--twelve cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:16 This is the inheritance of the people of Zebulun, according to their clans--these cities with their villages.

06Jos 19:22 The boundary also touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and its boundary ends at the Jordan--sixteen cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Issachar, according to their clans--the cities with their villages.

06Jos 19:25 Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
06Jos 19:26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west it touches Carmel and Shihor-libnath,
06Jos 19:27 then it turns eastward, it goes to Beth-dagon, and touches Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel. Then it continues in the north to Cabul,
06Jos 19:28 Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, as far as Sidon the Great.
06Jos 19:29 Then the boundary turns to Ramah, reaching to the fortified city of Tyre. Then the boundary turns to Hosah, and it ends at the sea; Mahalab, Achzib,
06Jos 19:30 Ummah, Aphek and Rehob--twenty-two cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Asher according to their clans--these cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:32 The sixth lot came out for the people of Naphtali, for the people of Naphtali, according to their clans.
06Jos 19:33 And their boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan.
06Jos 19:34 Then the boundary turns westward to Aznoth-tabor and goes from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun at the south and Asher on the west and Judah on the east at the Jordan.
06Jos 19:35 The fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,

06Jos 19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Naphtali according to their clans--the cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the people of Dan, according to their clans.
06Jos 19:41 And the territory of its inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,

06Jos 19:45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
06Jos 19:46 and Me-jarkon and Rakkon with the territory over against Joppa.
06Jos 19:47 When the territory of the people of Dan was lost to them, the people of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and after capturing it and striking it with the sword they took possession of it and settled in it, calling Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor.
06Jos 19:48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Dan, according to their clans--these cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:49 When they had finished distributing the several territories of the land as inheritances, the people of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun.
06Jos 19:50 By command of the LORD they gave him the city that he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he rebuilt the city and settled in it.
06Jos 19:51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel distributed by lot at Shiloh before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
06Jos 20:1 Then the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 20:2 "Say to the people of Israel, 'Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
06Jos 20:3 that the manslayer who strikes any person without intent or unknowingly may flee there. They shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.
06Jos 20:4 He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city. Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place, and he shall remain with them.
06Jos 20:5 And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unknowingly, and did not hate him in the past.
06Jos 20:6 And he shall remain in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time. Then the manslayer may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'"
06Jos 20:7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06Jos 20:8 And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 20:9 These were the cities designated for all the people of Israel and for the stranger sojourning among them, that anyone who killed a person without intent could flee there, so that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, till he stood before the congregation.
06Jos 21:1 Then the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
06Jos 21:2 And they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, "The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in, along with their pasturelands for our livestock."
06Jos 21:3 So by command of the LORD the people of Israel gave to the Levites the following cities and pasturelands out of their inheritance.
06Jos 21:4 The lot came out for the clans of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, thirteen cities.
06Jos 21:5 And the rest of the Kohathites received by lot from the clans of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
06Jos 21:6 The Gershonites received by lot from the clans of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
06Jos 21:7 The Merarites according to their clans received from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
06Jos 21:8 These cities and their pasturelands the people of Israel gave by lot to the Levites, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06Jos 21:9 Out of the tribe of the people of Judah and the tribe of the people of Simeon they gave the following cities mentioned by name,
06Jos 21:10 which went to the descendants of Aaron, one of the clans of the Kohathites who belonged to the people of Levi; since the lot fell to them first.
06Jos 21:11 They gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasturelands around it.
06Jos 21:12 But the fields of the city and its villages had been given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06Jos 21:13 And to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands, Libnah with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:14 Jattir with its pasturelands, Eshtemoa with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:15 Holon with its pasturelands, Debir with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:16 Ain with its pasturelands, Juttah with its pasturelands, Beth-shemesh with its pasturelands--nine cities out of these two tribes;
06Jos 21:17 then out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasturelands, Geba with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth with its pasturelands, and Almon with its pasturelands--four cities.
06Jos 21:19 The cities of the descendants of Aaron, the priests, were in all thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:20 As to the rest of the Kohathites belonging to the Kohathite clans of the Levites, the cities allotted to them were out of the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 21:21 To them were given Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim with its pasturelands, Beth-horon with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:23 and out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasturelands, Gibbethon with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon with its pasturelands, Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:25 and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands--two cities.
06Jos 21:26 The cities of the clans of the rest of the Kohathites were ten in all with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:27 And to the Gershonites, one of the clans of the Levites, were given out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with its pasturelands, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Beeshterah with its pasturelands--two cities;
06Jos 21:28 and out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth with its pasturelands, En-gannim with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:30 and out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:31 Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:32 and out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasturelands, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands--three cities.
06Jos 21:33 The cities of the several clans of the Gershonites were in all thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:34 And to the rest of the Levites, the Merarite clans, were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah with its pasturelands, Nahalal with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:36 and out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its pasturelands, Jahaz with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands--four cities;
06Jos 21:38 and out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its pasturelands, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Mahanaim with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon with its pasturelands, Jazer with its pasturelands--four cities in all.
06Jos 21:40 As for the cities of the several Merarite clans, that is, the remainder of the clans of the Levites, those allotted to them were in all twelve cities.
06Jos 21:41 The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the people of Israel were in all forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:42 These cities each had its pasturelands around it. So it was with all these cities.
06Jos 21:43 Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there.
06Jos 21:44 And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands.
06Jos 21:45 Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
06Jos 22:1 At that time Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
06Jos 22:2 and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you.
06Jos 22:3 You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.
06Jos 22:4 And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them. Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
06Jos 22:5 Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
06Jos 22:6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
06Jos 22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them,
06Jos 22:8 he said to them, "Go back to your tents with much wealth and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
06Jos 22:9 So the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through Moses.
06Jos 22:10 And when they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of imposing size.
06Jos 22:11 And the people of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel."
06Jos 22:12 And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.
06Jos 22:13 Then the people of Israel sent to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
06Jos 22:14 and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
06Jos 22:15 And they came to the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,
06Jos 22:16 "Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this breach of faith that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the LORD by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the LORD?
06Jos 22:17 Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,
06Jos 22:18 that you too must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if you too rebel against the LORD today then tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
06Jos 22:19 But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the LORD's land where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
06Jos 22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"
06Jos 22:21 Then the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,
06Jos 22:22 "The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today
06Jos 22:23 for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD. Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.
06Jos 22:24 No, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, 'What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
06Jos 22:25 For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you people of Reuben and people of Gad. You have no portion in the LORD.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.
06Jos 22:26 Therefore we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,
06Jos 22:27 but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'
06Jos 22:28 And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, 'Behold, the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.'
06Jos 22:29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"
06Jos 22:30 When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes.
06Jos 22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this breach of faith against the LORD. Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD."
06Jos 22:32 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them.
06Jos 22:33 And the report was good in the eyes of the people of Israel. And the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled.
06Jos 22:34 The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness, "For," they said, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
06Jos 23:1 A long time afterward, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,
06Jos 23:2 Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, "I am now old and well advanced in years.
06Jos 23:3 And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you.
06Jos 23:4 Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
06Jos 23:5 The LORD your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
06Jos 23:6 Therefore, be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
06Jos 23:7 that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them,
06Jos 23:8 but you shall cling to the LORD your God just as you have done to this day.
06Jos 23:9 For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day.
06Jos 23:10 One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God who fights for you, just as he promised you.
06Jos 23:11 Be very careful, therefore, to love the LORD your God.
06Jos 23:12 For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
06Jos 23:13 know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the LORD your God has given you.
06Jos 23:14 "And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.
06Jos 23:15 But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the LORD your God has given you,
06Jos 23:16 if you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you."
06Jos 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And they presented themselves before God.
06Jos 24:2 And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.
06Jos 24:3 Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac.
06Jos 24:4 And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
06Jos 24:5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.
06Jos 24:6 "'Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
06Jos 24:7 And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time.
06Jos 24:8 Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
06Jos 24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,
06Jos 24:10 but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand.
06Jos 24:11 And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand.
06Jos 24:12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.
06Jos 24:13 I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.'
06Jos 24:14 "Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
06Jos 24:15 And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
06Jos 24:16 Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods,
06Jos 24:17 for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
06Jos 24:18 And the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."
06Jos 24:19 But Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
06Jos 24:20 If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good."
06Jos 24:21 And the people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD."
06Jos 24:22 Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses."
06Jos 24:23 He said, "Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06Jos 24:24 And the people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey."
06Jos 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and put in place statutes and rules for them at Shechem.
06Jos 24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
06Jos 24:27 And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God."
06Jos 24:28 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
06Jos 24:29 After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being 110 years old.
06Jos 24:30 And they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
06Jos 24:31 Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the LORD did for Israel.
06Jos 24:32 As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. It became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
06Jos 24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
07
07Jdg 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the LORD, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
07Jdg 1:2 The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand."
07Jdg 1:3 And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him.
07Jdg 1:4 Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek.
07Jdg 1:5 They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
07Jdg 1:6 Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
07Jdg 1:7 And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07Jdg 1:8 And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
07Jdg 1:9 And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.
07Jdg 1:10 And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
07Jdg 1:11 From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher.
07Jdg 1:12 And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife."
07Jdg 1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
07Jdg 1:14 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
07Jdg 1:15 She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
07Jdg 1:16 And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people.
07Jdg 1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
07Jdg 1:18 Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
07Jdg 1:19 And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron.
07Jdg 1:20 And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.
07Jdg 1:21 But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
07Jdg 1:22 The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
07Jdg 1:23 And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
07Jdg 1:24 And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."
07Jdg 1:25 And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
07Jdg 1:26 And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.
07Jdg 1:27 Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
07Jdg 1:28 When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.
07Jdg 1:29 And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
07Jdg 1:30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.
07Jdg 1:31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob,
07Jdg 1:32 so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.
07Jdg 1:33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
07Jdg 1:34 The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain.
07Jdg 1:35 The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.
07Jdg 1:36 And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
07Jdg 2:1 Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you,
07Jdg 2:2 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?
07Jdg 2:3 So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you."
07Jdg 2:4 As soon as the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
07Jdg 2:5 And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.
07Jdg 2:6 When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.
07Jdg 2:7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110 years.
07Jdg 2:9 And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
07Jdg 2:10 And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:11 And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
07Jdg 2:12 And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the LORD to anger.
07Jdg 2:13 They abandoned the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth.
07Jdg 2:14 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
07Jdg 2:15 Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.
07Jdg 2:16 Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
07Jdg 2:17 Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so.
07Jdg 2:18 Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.
07Jdg 2:19 But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
07Jdg 2:20 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, "Because this people has transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice,
07Jdg 2:21 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
07Jdg 2:22 in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not."
07Jdg 2:23 So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
07Jdg 3:1 Now these are the nations that the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan.
07Jdg 3:2 It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before.
07Jdg 3:3 These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
07Jdg 3:4 They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
07Jdg 3:5 So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
07Jdg 3:6 And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.
07Jdg 3:7 And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
07Jdg 3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
07Jdg 3:9 But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
07Jdg 3:10 The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
07Jdg 3:11 So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
07Jdg 3:12 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
07Jdg 3:13 He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms.
07Jdg 3:14 And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
07Jdg 3:15 Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
07Jdg 3:16 And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes.
07Jdg 3:17 And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
07Jdg 3:18 And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.
07Jdg 3:19 But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence.
07Jdg 3:20 And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.
07Jdg 3:21 And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
07Jdg 3:22 And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out.
07Jdg 3:23 Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.
07Jdg 3:24 When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber."
07Jdg 3:25 And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
07Jdg 3:26 Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah.
07Jdg 3:27 When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader.
07Jdg 3:28 And he said to them, "Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over.
07Jdg 3:29 And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.
07Jdg 3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
07Jdg 3:31 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.
07Jdg 4:1 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died.
07Jdg 4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
07Jdg 4:3 Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.
07Jdg 4:4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
07Jdg 4:5 She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
07Jdg 4:6 She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, "Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun.
07Jdg 4:7 And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand'?"
07Jdg 4:8 Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
07Jdg 4:9 And she said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:10 And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
07Jdg 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:12 When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
07Jdg 4:13 Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.
07Jdg 4:14 And Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.
07Jdg 4:15 And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot.
07Jdg 4:16 And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
07Jdg 4:17 But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
07Jdg 4:18 And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
07Jdg 4:19 And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
07Jdg 4:20 And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'"
07Jdg 4:21 But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.
07Jdg 4:22 And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
07Jdg 4:23 So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.
07Jdg 4:24 And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
07Jdg 5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:
07Jdg 5:2 "That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the LORD!
07Jdg 5:3 "Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the LORD I will sing; I will make melody to the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:4 "LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water.
07Jdg 5:5 The mountains quaked before the LORD, even Sinai before the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:6 "In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned, and travelers kept to the byways.
07Jdg 5:7 The villagers ceased in Israel; they ceased to be until I arose; I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel.
07Jdg 5:8 When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?
07Jdg 5:9 My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD.
07Jdg 5:10 "Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way.
07Jdg 5:11 To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the righteous triumphs of the LORD, the righteous triumphs of his villagers in Israel. "Then down to the gates marched the people of the LORD.
07Jdg 5:12 "Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, break out in a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam.
07Jdg 5:13 Then down marched the remnant of the noble; the people of the LORD marched down for me against the mighty.
07Jdg 5:14 From Ephraim their root they marched down into the valley, following you, Benjamin, with your kinsmen; from Machir marched down the commanders, and from Zebulun those who bear the lieutenant's staff;
07Jdg 5:15 the princes of Issachar came with Deborah, and Issachar faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
07Jdg 5:16 Why did you sit still among the sheepfolds, to hear the whistling for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
07Jdg 5:17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why did he stay with the ships? Asher sat still at the coast of the sea, staying by his landings.
07Jdg 5:18 Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the field.
07Jdg 5:19 "The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they got no spoils of silver.
07Jdg 5:20 From heaven the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.
07Jdg 5:21 The torrent Kishon swept them away, the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. March on, my soul, with might!
07Jdg 5:22 "Then loud beat the horses' hoofs with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.
07Jdg 5:23 "Curse Meroz, says the angel of the LORD, curse its inhabitants thoroughly, because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
07Jdg 5:24 "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed.
07Jdg 5:25 He asked water and she gave him milk; she brought him curds in a noble's bowl.
07Jdg 5:26 She sent her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen's mallet; she struck Sisera; she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple.
07Jdg 5:27 Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; between her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead.
07Jdg 5:28 "Out of the window she peered, the mother of Sisera wailed through the lattice: 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?'
07Jdg 5:29 Her wisest princesses answer, indeed, she answers herself,
07Jdg 5:30 'Have they not found and divided the spoil?-- A womb or two for every man; spoil of dyed materials for Sisera, spoil of dyed materials embroidered, two pieces of dyed work embroidered for the neck as spoil?'
07Jdg 5:31 "So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might." And the land had rest for forty years.
07Jdg 6:1 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years.
07Jdg 6:2 And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
07Jdg 6:3 For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.
07Jdg 6:4 They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.
07Jdg 6:5 For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number--both they and their camels could not be counted--so that they laid waste the land as they came in.
07Jdg 6:6 And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD.
07Jdg 6:7 When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites,
07Jdg 6:8 the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage.
07Jdg 6:9 And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
07Jdg 6:10 And I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice."
07Jdg 6:11 Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
07Jdg 6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor."
07Jdg 6:13 And Gideon said to him, "Please, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian."
07Jdg 6:14 And the LORD turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?"
07Jdg 6:15 And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
07Jdg 6:16 And the LORD said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man."
07Jdg 6:17 And he said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.
07Jdg 6:18 Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you." And he said, "I will stay till you return."
07Jdg 6:19 So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.
07Jdg 6:20 And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them." And he did so.
07Jdg 6:21 Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
07Jdg 6:22 Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."
07Jdg 6:23 But the LORD said to him, "Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die."
07Jdg 6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.
07Jdg 6:25 That night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it
07Jdg 6:26 and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down."
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.
07Jdg 6:28 When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.
07Jdg 6:29 And they said to one another, "Who has done this thing?" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."
07Jdg 6:30 Then the men of the town said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it."
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down."
07Jdg 6:32 Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he broke down his altar.
07Jdg 6:33 Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.
07Jdg 6:34 But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.
07Jdg 6:35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.
07Jdg 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,
07Jdg 6:37 behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said."
07Jdg 6:38 And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
07Jdg 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew."
07Jdg 6:40 And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
07Jdg 7:1 Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
07Jdg 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'
07Jdg 7:3 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.'" Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.
07Jdg 7:4 And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' shall not go."
07Jdg 7:5 So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, "Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink."
07Jdg 7:6 And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.
07Jdg 7:7 And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home."
07Jdg 7:8 So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
07Jdg 7:9 That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand.
07Jdg 7:10 But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant.
07Jdg 7:11 And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp.
07Jdg 7:12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance.
07Jdg 7:13 When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
07Jdg 7:14 And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp."
07Jdg 7:15 As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the LORD has given the host of Midian into your hand."
07Jdg 7:16 And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.
07Jdg 7:17 And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
07Jdg 7:18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
07Jdg 7:19 So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
07Jdg 7:20 Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
07Jdg 7:21 Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled.
07Jdg 7:22 When they blew the 300 trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
07Jdg 7:23 And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.
07Jdg 7:25 And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.
07Jdg 8:1 Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they accused him fiercely.
07Jdg 8:2 And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
07Jdg 8:3 God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger against him subsided when he said this.
07Jdg 8:4 And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing.
07Jdg 8:5 So he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07Jdg 8:6 And the officials of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"
07Jdg 8:7 So Gideon said, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
07Jdg 8:8 And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
07Jdg 8:9 And he said to the men of Penuel, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
07Jdg 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword.
07Jdg 8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure.
07Jdg 8:12 And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.
07Jdg 8:13 Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
07Jdg 8:14 And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.
07Jdg 8:15 And he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?'"
07Jdg 8:16 And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson.
07Jdg 8:17 And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
07Jdg 8:18 Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king."
07Jdg 8:19 And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you."
07Jdg 8:20 So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Rise and kill them!" But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man.
07Jdg 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian."
07Jdg 8:23 Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."
07Jdg 8:24 And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
07Jdg 8:25 And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil.
07Jdg 8:26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:27 And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
07Jdg 8:28 So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
07Jdg 8:29 Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
07Jdg 8:30 Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
07Jdg 8:31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
07Jdg 8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07Jdg 8:33 As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and whored after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god.
07Jdg 8:34 And the people of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side,
07Jdg 8:35 and they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.
07Jdg 9:1 Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family,
07Jdg 9:2 "Say in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
07Jdg 9:3 And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
07Jdg 9:4 And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
07Jdg 9:5 And he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
07Jdg 9:6 And all the leaders of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
07Jdg 9:7 When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, "Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
07Jdg 9:8 The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
07Jdg 9:9 But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:10 And the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and reign over us.'
07Jdg 9:11 But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:12 And the trees said to the vine, 'You come and reign over us.'
07Jdg 9:13 But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come and reign over us.'
07Jdg 9:15 And the bramble said to the trees, 'If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'
07Jdg 9:16 "Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved--
07Jdg 9:17 for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian,
07Jdg 9:18 and you have risen up against my father's house this day and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative--
07Jdg 9:19 if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
07Jdg 9:20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech."
07Jdg 9:21 And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother.
07Jdg 9:22 Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
07Jdg 9:23 And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
07Jdg 9:24 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
07Jdg 9:25 And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him.
07Jdg 9:27 And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
07Jdg 9:29 Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say to Abimelech, 'Increase your army, and come out.'"
07Jdg 9:30 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
07Jdg 9:31 And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.
07Jdg 9:32 Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field.
07Jdg 9:33 Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do."
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies.
07Jdg 9:35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush.
07Jdg 9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!" And Zebul said to him, "You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men."
07Jdg 9:37 Gaal spoke again and said, "Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak."
07Jdg 9:38 Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your mouth now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them."
07Jdg 9:39 And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.
07Jdg 9:41 And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.
07Jdg 9:42 On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told.
07Jdg 9:43 He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them.
07Jdg 9:44 Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them.
07Jdg 9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
07Jdg 9:46 When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith.
07Jdg 9:47 Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
07Jdg 9:48 And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done."
07Jdg 9:49 So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
07Jdg 9:50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it.
07Jdg 9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower.
07Jdg 9:52 And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
07Jdg 9:53 And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull.
07Jdg 9:54 Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, 'A woman killed him.'" And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
07Jdg 9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home.
07Jdg 9:56 Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers.
07Jdg 9:57 And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
07Jdg 10:1 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 10:2 And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir.
07Jdg 10:3 After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
07Jdg 10:4 And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
07Jdg 10:5 And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
07Jdg 10:6 The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook the LORD and did not serve him.
07Jdg 10:7 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
07Jdg 10:8 and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
07Jdg 10:9 And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.
07Jdg 10:10 And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals."
07Jdg 10:11 And the LORD said to the people of Israel, "Did I not save you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines?
07Jdg 10:12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
07Jdg 10:13 Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress."
07Jdg 10:15 And the people of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day."
07Jdg 10:16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and he became impatient over the misery of Israel.
07Jdg 10:17 Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah.
07Jdg 10:18 And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
07Jdg 11:2 And Gilead's wife also bore him sons. And when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman."
07Jdg 11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless fellows collected around Jephthah and went out with him.
07Jdg 11:4 After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.
07Jdg 11:5 And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.
07Jdg 11:6 And they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our leader, that we may fight against the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:7 But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
07Jdg 11:8 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That is why we have turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them over to me, I will be your head."
07Jdg 11:10 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD will be witness between us, if we do not do as you say."
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.
07Jdg 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, "What do you have against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
07Jdg 11:13 And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel on coming up from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably."
07Jdg 11:14 Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
07Jdg 11:15 and said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
07Jdg 11:16 but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:17 Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us pass through your land,' but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:18 "Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
07Jdg 11:19 Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, 'Please let us pass through your land to our country,'
07Jdg 11:20 but Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
07Jdg 11:21 And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.
07Jdg 11:22 And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
07Jdg 11:23 So then the LORD, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them?
07Jdg 11:24 Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess.
07Jdg 11:25 Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them?
07Jdg 11:26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, 300 years, why did you not deliver them within that time?
07Jdg 11:27 I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me. The LORD, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon."
07Jdg 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him.
07Jdg 11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, "If you will give the Ammonites into my hand,
07Jdg 11:31 then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
07Jdg 11:32 So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD gave them into his hand.
07Jdg 11:33 And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a great blow. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.
07Jdg 11:34 Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah. And behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
07Jdg 11:35 And as soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot take back my vow."
07Jdg 11:36 And she said to him, "My father, you have opened your mouth to the LORD; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:37 So she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions."
07Jdg 11:38 So he said, "Go." Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains.
07Jdg 11:39 And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man, and it became a custom in Israel
07Jdg 11:40 that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
07Jdg 12:1 The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire."
07Jdg 12:2 And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand.
07Jdg 12:3 And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"
07Jdg 12:4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh."
07Jdg 12:5 And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead said to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he said, "No,"
07Jdg 12:6 they said to him, "Then say Shibboleth," and he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead.
07Jdg 12:8 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
07Jdg 12:9 He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
07Jdg 12:10 Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
07Jdg 12:11 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
07Jdg 12:12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07Jdg 12:13 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
07Jdg 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years.
07Jdg 12:15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07Jdg 13:1 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
07Jdg 13:2 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and had no children.
07Jdg 13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.
07Jdg 13:4 Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean,
07Jdg 13:5 for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines."
07Jdg 13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name,
07Jdg 13:7 but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
07Jdg 13:8 Then Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born."
07Jdg 13:9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her.
07Jdg 13:10 So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."
07Jdg 13:11 And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to this woman?" And he said, "I am."
07Jdg 13:12 And Manoah said, "Now when your words come true, what is to be the child's manner of life, and what is his mission?"
07Jdg 13:13 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.
07Jdg 13:14 She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe."
07Jdg 13:15 Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you."
07Jdg 13:16 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD." (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)
07Jdg 13:17 And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?"
07Jdg 13:18 And the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
07Jdg 13:19 So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to the one who works wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching.
07Jdg 13:20 And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground.
07Jdg 13:21 The angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
07Jdg 13:22 And Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God."
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these."
07Jdg 13:24 And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the young man grew, and the LORD blessed him.
07Jdg 13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 14:1 Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.
07Jdg 14:2 Then he came up and told his father and mother, "I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife."
07Jdg 14:3 But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes."
07Jdg 14:4 His father and mother did not know that it was from the LORD, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.
07Jdg 14:5 Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring.
07Jdg 14:6 Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
07Jdg 14:7 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson's eyes.
07Jdg 14:8 After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
07Jdg 14:9 He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.
07Jdg 14:10 His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do.
07Jdg 14:11 As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
07Jdg 14:12 And Samson said to them, "Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes,
07Jdg 14:13 but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Put your riddle, that we may hear it."
07Jdg 14:14 And he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet." And in three days they could not solve the riddle.
07Jdg 14:15 On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?"
07Jdg 14:16 And Samson's wife wept over him and said, "You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?"
07Jdg 14:17 She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people.
07Jdg 14:18 And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."
07Jdg 14:19 And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house.
07Jdg 14:20 And Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.
07Jdg 15:1 After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, "I will go in to my wife in the chamber." But her father would not allow him to go in.
07Jdg 15:2 And her father said, "I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead."
07Jdg 15:3 And Samson said to them, "This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm."
07Jdg 15:4 So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails.
07Jdg 15:5 And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.
07Jdg 15:6 Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion." And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
07Jdg 15:7 And Samson said to them, "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit."
07Jdg 15:8 And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
07Jdg 15:9 Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi.
07Jdg 15:10 And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us."
07Jdg 15:11 Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."
07Jdg 15:12 And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves."
07Jdg 15:13 They said to him, "No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
07Jdg 15:14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.
07Jdg 15:15 And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men.
07Jdg 15:16 And Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men."
07Jdg 15:17 As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.
07Jdg 15:18 And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the LORD and said, "You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
07Jdg 15:19 And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day.
07Jdg 15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
07Jdg 16:1 Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her.
07Jdg 16:2 The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here." And they surrounded the place and set an ambush for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, "Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him."
07Jdg 16:3 But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.
07Jdg 16:4 After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
07Jdg 16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, "Seduce him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to humble him. And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver."
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you."
07Jdg 16:7 Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
07Jdg 16:9 Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings, as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
07Jdg 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you might be bound."
07Jdg 16:11 And he said to her, "If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:12 So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
07Jdg 16:13 Then Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:14 So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.
07Jdg 16:15 And she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me where your great strength lies."
07Jdg 16:16 And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death.
07Jdg 16:17 And he told her all his heart, and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:18 When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up again, for he has told me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands.
07Jdg 16:19 She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.
07Jdg 16:20 And she said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
07Jdg 16:21 And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison.
07Jdg 16:22 But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
07Jdg 16:23 Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand."
07Jdg 16:24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us."
07Jdg 16:25 And when their hearts were merry, they said, "Call Samson, that he may entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars.
07Jdg 16:26 And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them."
07Jdg 16:27 Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women, who looked on while Samson entertained.
07Jdg 16:28 Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes."
07Jdg 16:29 And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.
07Jdg 16:30 And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life.
07Jdg 16:31 Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.
07Jdg 17:1 There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
07Jdg 17:2 And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD."
07Jdg 17:3 And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you."
07Jdg 17:4 So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
07Jdg 17:5 And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest.
07Jdg 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
07Jdg 17:7 Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
07Jdg 17:8 And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
07Jdg 17:9 And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place."
07Jdg 17:10 And Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living." And the Levite went in.
07Jdg 17:11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
07Jdg 17:12 And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
07Jdg 17:13 Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest."
07Jdg 18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them.
07Jdg 18:2 So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, "Go and explore the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
07Jdg 18:3 When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?"
07Jdg 18:4 And he said to them, "This is how Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest."
07Jdg 18:5 And they said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed."
07Jdg 18:6 And the priest said to them, "Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the LORD."
07Jdg 18:7 Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
07Jdg 18:8 And when they came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What do you report?"
07Jdg 18:9 They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land.
07Jdg 18:10 As soon as you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth."
07Jdg 18:11 So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,
07Jdg 18:12 and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
07Jdg 18:13 And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
07Jdg 18:14 Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do."
07Jdg 18:15 And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare.
07Jdg 18:16 Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate.
07Jdg 18:17 And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.
07Jdg 18:18 And when these went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
07Jdg 18:19 And they said to him, "Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?"
07Jdg 18:20 And the priest's heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
07Jdg 18:21 So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and the goods in front of them.
07Jdg 18:22 When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan.
07Jdg 18:23 And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?"
07Jdg 18:24 And he said, "You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, 'What is the matter with you?'"
07Jdg 18:25 And the people of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household."
07Jdg 18:26 Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
07Jdg 18:27 But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
07Jdg 18:28 And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
07Jdg 18:29 And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first.
07Jdg 18:30 And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
07Jdg 18:31 So they set up Micah's carved image that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
07Jdg 19:1 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
07Jdg 19:2 And his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.
07Jdg 19:3 Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house. And when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.
07Jdg 19:4 And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there.
07Jdg 19:5 And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go."
07Jdg 19:6 So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to the man, "Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry."
07Jdg 19:7 And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again.
07Jdg 19:8 And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl's father said, "Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines." So they ate, both of them.
07Jdg 19:9 And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home."
07Jdg 19:10 But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.
07Jdg 19:11 When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it."
07Jdg 19:12 And his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah."
07Jdg 19:13 And he said to his young man, "Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah."
07Jdg 19:14 So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin,
07Jdg 19:15 and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night.
07Jdg 19:16 And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. The men of the place were Benjaminites.
07Jdg 19:17 And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, "Where are you going? And where do you come from?"
07Jdg 19:18 And he said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of the Lord, but no one has taken me into his house.
07Jdg 19:19 We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. There is no lack of anything."
07Jdg 19:20 And the old man said, "Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. Only, do not spend the night in the square."
07Jdg 19:21 So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
07Jdg 19:22 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him."
07Jdg 19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing.
07Jdg 19:24 Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man do not do this outrageous thing."
07Jdg 19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go.
07Jdg 19:26 And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.
07Jdg 19:27 And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
07Jdg 19:28 He said to her, "Get up, let us be going." But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home.
07Jdg 19:29 And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
07Jdg 19:30 And all who saw it said, "Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak."
07Jdg 20:1 Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah.
07Jdg 20:2 And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, 400,000 men on foot that drew the sword.
07Jdg 20:3 (Now the people of Benjamin heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the people of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"
07Jdg 20:4 And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.
07Jdg 20:5 And the leaders of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house against me by night. They meant to kill me, and they violated my concubine, and she is dead.
07Jdg 20:6 So I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed abomination and outrage in Israel.
07Jdg 20:7 Behold, you people of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."
07Jdg 20:8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, "None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house.
07Jdg 20:9 But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot,
07Jdg 20:10 and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the people, that when they come they may repay Gibeah of Benjamin, for all the outrage that they have committed in Israel."
07Jdg 20:11 So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.
07Jdg 20:12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What evil is this that has taken place among you?
07Jdg 20:13 Now therefore give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel.
07Jdg 20:14 Then the people of Benjamin came together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the people of Israel.
07Jdg 20:15 And the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered 700 chosen men.
07Jdg 20:16 Among all these were 700 chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
07Jdg 20:17 And the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 men who drew the sword; all these were men of war.
07Jdg 20:18 The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and inquired of God, "Who shall go up first for us to fight against the people of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first."
07Jdg 20:19 Then the people of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:20 And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin, and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:21 The people of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and destroyed on that day 22,000 men of the Israelites.
07Jdg 20:22 But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day.
07Jdg 20:23 And the people of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until the evening. And they inquired of the LORD, "Shall we again draw near to fight against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against them."
07Jdg 20:24 So the people of Israel came near against the people of Benjamin the second day.
07Jdg 20:25 And Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed 18,000 men of the people of Israel. All these were men who drew the sword.
07Jdg 20:26 Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
07Jdg 20:27 And the people of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
07Jdg 20:28 and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, "Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand."
07Jdg 20:29 So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:30 And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
07Jdg 20:31 And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel.
07Jdg 20:32 And the people of Benjamin said, "They are routed before us, as at the first." But the people of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways."
07Jdg 20:33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba.
07Jdg 20:34 And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them.
07Jdg 20:35 And the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day. All these were men who drew the sword.
07Jdg 20:36 So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:37 Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
07Jdg 20:38 Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city
07Jdg 20:39 the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
07Jdg 20:40 But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.
07Jdg 20:41 Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them.
07Jdg 20:42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst.
07Jdg 20:43 Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah as far as opposite Gibeah on the east.
07Jdg 20:44 Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor.
07Jdg 20:45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down.
07Jdg 20:46 So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor.
07Jdg 20:47 But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months.
07Jdg 20:48 And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire.
07Jdg 21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, "No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin."
07Jdg 21:2 And the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
07Jdg 21:3 And they said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?"
07Jdg 21:4 And the next day the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
07Jdg 21:5 And the people of Israel said, "Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
07Jdg 21:6 And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.
07Jdg 21:7 What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?"
07Jdg 21:8 And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly.
07Jdg 21:9 For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.
07Jdg 21:10 So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones.
07Jdg 21:11 This is what you shall do: every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction."
07Jdg 21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
07Jdg 21:13 Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and proclaimed peace to them.
07Jdg 21:14 And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them.
07Jdg 21:15 And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
07Jdg 21:17 And they said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
07Jdg 21:18 Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters." For the people of Israel had sworn, "Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin."
07Jdg 21:19 So they said, "Behold, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
07Jdg 21:20 And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards
07Jdg 21:21 and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
07Jdg 21:22 And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.'"
07Jdg 21:23 And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and lived in them.
07Jdg 21:24 And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
07Jdg 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
08
08Ru 1:1 In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
08Ru 1:2 The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.
08Ru 1:3 But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.
08Ru 1:4 These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,
08Ru 1:5 and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
08Ru 1:6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the LORD had visited his people and given them food.
08Ru 1:7 So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
08Ru 1:8 But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
08Ru 1:9 The LORD grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband!" Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
08Ru 1:10 And they said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people."
08Ru 1:11 But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?
08Ru 1:12 Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons,
08Ru 1:13 would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me."
08Ru 1:14 Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
08Ru 1:15 And she said, "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.
08Ru 1:17 Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you."
08Ru 1:18 And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
08Ru 1:19 So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them. And the women said, "Is this Naomi?"
08Ru 1:20 She said to them, "Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
08Ru 1:21 I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?"
08Ru 1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
08Ru 2:1 Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.
08Ru 2:2 And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter."
08Ru 2:3 So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.
08Ru 2:4 And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem. And he said to the reapers, "The LORD be with you!" And they answered, "The LORD bless you."
08Ru 2:5 Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?"
08Ru 2:6 And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "She is the young Moabite woman, who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.
08Ru 2:7 She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.' So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, except for a short rest."
08Ru 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.
08Ru 2:9 Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn."
08Ru 2:10 Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?"
08Ru 2:11 But Boaz answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.
08Ru 2:12 The LORD repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!"
08Ru 2:13 Then she said, "I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants."
08Ru 2:14 And at mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine." So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain. And she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.
08Ru 2:15 When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
08Ru 2:16 And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her."
08Ru 2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
08Ru 2:18 And she took it up and went into the city. Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied.
08Ru 2:19 And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz."
08Ru 2:20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!" Naomi also said to her, "The man is a close relative of ours, one of our redeemers."
08Ru 2:21 And Ruth the Moabite said, "Besides, he said to me, 'You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.'"
08Ru 2:22 And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, lest in another field you be assaulted."
08Ru 2:23 So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:1 Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
08Ru 3:2 Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
08Ru 3:3 Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
08Ru 3:4 But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do."
08Ru 3:5 And she replied, "All that you say I will do."
08Ru 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.
08Ru 3:7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
08Ru 3:8 At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!
08Ru 3:9 He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer."
08Ru 3:10 And he said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.
08Ru 3:11 And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman.
08Ru 3:12 And now it is true that I am a redeemer. Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.
08Ru 3:13 Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good; let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning."
08Ru 3:14 So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another. And he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
08Ru 3:15 And he said, "Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out." So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her. Then she went into the city.
08Ru 3:16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did you fare, my daughter?" Then she told her all that the man had done for her,
08Ru 3:17 saying, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said to me, 'You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'"
08Ru 3:18 She replied, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today."
08Ru 4:1 Now Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, "Turn aside, friend; sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down.
08Ru 4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down.
08Ru 4:3 Then he said to the redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
08Ru 4:4 So I thought I would tell you of it and say, 'Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you." And he said, "I will redeem it."
08Ru 4:5 Then Boaz said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance."
08Ru 4:6 Then the redeemer said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it."
08Ru 4:7 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.
08Ru 4:8 So when the redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself," he drew off his sandal.
08Ru 4:9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon.
08Ru 4:10 Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day."
08Ru 4:11 Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem,
08Ru 4:12 and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman."
08Ru 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
08Ru 4:14 Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!
08Ru 4:15 He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him."
08Ru 4:16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.
08Ru 4:17 And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08Ru 4:18 Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,
08Ru 4:19 Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab,
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon,
08Ru 4:21 Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed,
08Ru 4:22 Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.

091Sm 1:1 There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
091Sm 1:2 He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
091Sm 1:3 Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.
091Sm 1:4 On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
091Sm 1:5 But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.
091Sm 1:6 And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
091Sm 1:7 So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
091Sm 1:8 And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"
091Sm 1:9 After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
091Sm 1:10 She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.
091Sm 1:11 And she vowed a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."
091Sm 1:12 As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
091Sm 1:13 Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
091Sm 1:14 And Eli said to her, "How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you."
091Sm 1:15 But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
091Sm 1:16 Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."
091Sm 1:17 Then Eli answered, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him."
091Sm 1:18 And she said, "Let your servant find favor in your eyes." Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
091Sm 1:19 They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
091Sm 1:20 And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, "I have asked for him from the LORD."
091Sm 1:21 The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.
091Sm 1:22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever."
091Sm 1:23 Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
091Sm 1:24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young.
091Sm 1:25 Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
091Sm 1:26 And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.
091Sm 1:27 For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.
091Sm 1:28 Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
091Sm 2:1 And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.
091Sm 2:2 "There is none holy like the LORD; there is none besides you; there is no rock like our God.
091Sm 2:3 Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
091Sm 2:4 The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble bind on strength.
091Sm 2:5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.
091Sm 2:6 The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
091Sm 2:7 The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.
091Sm 2:8 He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world.
091Sm 2:9 "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by might shall a man prevail.
091Sm 2:10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the power of his anointed."
091Sm 2:11 Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.
091Sm 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD.
091Sm 2:13 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,
091Sm 2:14 and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
091Sm 2:15 Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw."
091Sm 2:16 And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish," he would say, "No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force."
091Sm 2:17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.
091Sm 2:18 Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod.
091Sm 2:19 And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
091Sm 2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, "May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD." So then they would return to their home.
091Sm 2:21 Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the young man Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.
091Sm 2:22 Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
091Sm 2:23 And he said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.
091Sm 2:24 No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.
091Sm 2:25 If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.
091Sm 2:26 Now the young man Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.
091Sm 2:27 And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, "Thus the LORD has said, 'Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh?
091Sm 2:28 Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.
091Sm 2:29 Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'
091Sm 2:30 Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
091Sm 2:31 Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.
091Sm 2:32 Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
091Sm 2:33 The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men.
091Sm 2:34 And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.
091Sm 2:35 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever.
091Sm 2:36 And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, "Please put me in one of the priests' places, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"
091Sm 3:1 Now the young man Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.
091Sm 3:2 At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.
091Sm 3:3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.
091Sm 3:4 Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, "Here I am!"
091Sm 3:5 and ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call; lie down again." So he went and lay down.
091Sm 3:6 And the LORD called again, "Samuel!" and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."
091Sm 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
091Sm 3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the young man.
091Sm 3:9 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
091Sm 3:10 And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant hears."
091Sm 3:11 Then the LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.
091Sm 3:12 On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
091Sm 3:13 And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.
091Sm 3:14 Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever."
091Sm 3:15 Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
091Sm 3:16 But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he said, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:17 And Eli said, "What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you."
091Sm 3:18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him."
091Sm 3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
091Sm 3:20 And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.
091Sm 3:21 And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
091Sm 4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.
091Sm 4:3 And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies."
091Sm 4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
091Sm 4:5 As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.
091Sm 4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,
091Sm 4:7 the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "A god has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
091Sm 4:8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.
091Sm 4:9 Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight."
091Sm 4:10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
091Sm 4:11 And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
091Sm 4:12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.
091Sm 4:13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.
091Sm 4:14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, "What is this uproar?" Then the man hurried and came and told Eli.
091Sm 4:15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see.
091Sm 4:16 And the man said to Eli, "I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today." And he said, "How did it go, my son?"
091Sm 4:17 He who brought the news answered and said, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 4:18 As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
091Sm 4:19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.
091Sm 4:20 And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son." But she did not answer or pay attention.
091Sm 4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel!" because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
091Sm 4:22 And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 5:1 When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
091Sm 5:2 Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon.
091Sm 5:3 And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
091Sm 5:4 But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
091Sm 5:5 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
091Sm 5:6 The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.
091Sm 5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god."
091Sm 5:8 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.
091Sm 5:9 But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
091Sm 5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people."
091Sm 5:11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people." For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
091Sm 5:12 The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
091Sm 6:1 The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
091Sm 6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place."
091Sm 6:3 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you."
091Sm 6:4 And they said, "What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?" They answered, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.
091Sm 6:5 So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land.
091Sm 6:6 Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed?
091Sm 6:7 Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.
091Sm 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way
091Sm 6:9 and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence."
091Sm 6:10 The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.
091Sm 6:11 And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.
091Sm 6:12 And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
091Sm 6:13 Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.
091Sm 6:14 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
091Sm 6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD.
091Sm 6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.
091Sm 6:17 These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron,
091Sm 6:18 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
091Sm 6:19 And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow.
091Sm 6:20 Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?"
091Sm 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you."
091Sm 7:1 And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD and brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the LORD.
091Sm 7:2 From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
091Sm 7:3 And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:4 So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the LORD only.
091Sm 7:5 Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."
091Sm 7:6 So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
091Sm 7:7 Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
091Sm 7:8 And the people of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:9 So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.
091Sm 7:10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were routed before Israel.
091Sm 7:11 And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.
091Sm 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer; for he said, "Till now the LORD has helped us."
091Sm 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
091Sm 7:14 The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
091Sm 7:15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
091Sm 7:16 And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all these places.
091Sm 7:17 Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he judged Israel. And he built there an altar to the LORD.
091Sm 8:1 When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
091Sm 8:2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.
091Sm 8:3 Yet his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain. They took bribes and perverted justice.
091Sm 8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah
091Sm 8:5 and said to him, "Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations."
091Sm 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
091Sm 8:7 And the LORD said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
091Sm 8:8 According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.
091Sm 8:9 Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them."
091Sm 8:10 So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him.
091Sm 8:11 He said, "These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
091Sm 8:12 And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
091Sm 8:13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
091Sm 8:14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
091Sm 8:15 He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
091Sm 8:16 He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
091Sm 8:17 He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
091Sm 8:18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day."
091Sm 8:19 But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, "No! But there shall be a king over us,
091Sm 8:20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles."
091Sm 8:21 And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
091Sm 8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, "Obey their voice and make them a king." Samuel then said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city."
091Sm 9:1 There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.
091Sm 9:2 And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
091Sm 9:3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, "Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys."
091Sm 9:4 And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.
091Sm 9:5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious about us."
091Sm 9:6 But he said to him, "Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes true. So now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go."
091Sm 9:7 Then Saul said to his servant, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
091Sm 9:8 The servant answered Saul again, "Here, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way."
091Sm 9:9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, "Come, let us go to the seer," for today's "prophet" was formerly called a seer.)
091Sm 9:10 And Saul said to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
091Sm 9:11 As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water and said to them, "Is the seer here?"
091Sm 9:12 They answered, "He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Hurry. He has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.
091Sm 9:13 As soon as you enter the city you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately."
091Sm 9:14 So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.
091Sm 9:15 Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel:
091Sm 9:16 "Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen my people, because their cry has come to me."
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall restrain my people."
091Sm 9:18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, "Tell me where is the house of the seer?"
091Sm 9:19 Samuel answered Saul, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.
091Sm 9:20 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?"
091Sm 9:21 Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?"
091Sm 9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.
091Sm 9:23 And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'"
091Sm 9:24 So the cook took up the leg and what was on it and set them before Saul. And Samuel said, "See, what was kept is set before you. Eat, because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
091Sm 9:25 And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep.
091Sm 9:26 Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Up, that I may send you on your way." So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
091Sm 9:27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on, stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God."
091Sm 10:1 Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said, "Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies. And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince over his heritage.
091Sm 10:2 When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, 'The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, "What shall I do about my son?"'
091Sm 10:3 Then you shall go on from there farther and come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
091Sm 10:4 And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.
091Sm 10:5 After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, where there is a garrison of the Philistines. And there, as soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.
091Sm 10:6 Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.
091Sm 10:7 Now when these signs meet you, do what your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
091Sm 10:8 Then go down before me to Gilgal. And behold, I am coming to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do."
091Sm 10:9 When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day.
091Sm 10:10 When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.
091Sm 10:11 And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 10:12 And a man of the place answered, "And who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 10:13 When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
091Sm 10:14 Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To seek the donkeys. And when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."
091Sm 10:15 And Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
091Sm 10:16 And Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found." But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
091Sm 10:17 Now Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah.
091Sm 10:18 And he said to the people of Israel, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'
091Sm 10:19 But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, 'Set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands."
091Sm 10:20 Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
091Sm 10:21 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot; and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
091Sm 10:22 So they inquired again of the LORD, "Is there a man still to come?" and the LORD said, "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
091Sm 10:23 Then they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
091Sm 10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
091Sm 10:25 Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship, and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home.
091Sm 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.
091Sm 10:27 But some worthless fellows said, "How can this man save us?" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
091Sm 11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead, and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
091Sm 11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "On this condition I will make a treaty with you, that I gouge out all your right eyes, and thus bring disgrace on all Israel."
091Sm 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days' respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you."
091Sm 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the ears of the people, and all the people wept aloud.
091Sm 11:5 Now, behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen. And Saul said, "What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?" So they told him the news of the men of Jabesh.
091Sm 11:6 And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.
091Sm 11:7 He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!" Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.
091Sm 11:8 When he mustered them at Bezek, the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
091Sm 11:9 And they said to the messengers who had come, "Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad.
091Sm 11:10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
091Sm 11:11 And the next day Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
091Sm 11:12 Then the people said to Samuel, "Who is it that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death."
091Sm 11:13 But Saul said, "Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel."
091Sm 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom."
091Sm 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
091Sm 12:1 And Samuel said to all Israel, "Behold, I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you.
091Sm 12:2 And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
091Sm 12:3 Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you."
091Sm 12:4 They said, "You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand."
091Sm 12:5 And he said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." And they said, "He is witness."
091Sm 12:6 And Samuel said to the people, "The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
091Sm 12:7 Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers.
091Sm 12:8 When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them, then your fathers cried out to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
091Sm 12:9 But they forgot the LORD their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them.
091Sm 12:10 And they cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.'
091Sm 12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.
091Sm 12:12 And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' when the LORD your God was your king.
091Sm 12:13 And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you.
091Sm 12:14 If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well.
091Sm 12:15 But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king.
091Sm 12:16 Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
091Sm 12:17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king."
091Sm 12:18 So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
091Sm 12:19 And all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king."
091Sm 12:20 And Samuel said to the people, "Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
091Sm 12:21 And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty.
091Sm 12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his people, for his great name's sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself.
091Sm 12:23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
091Sm 12:24 Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you.
091Sm 12:25 But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king."
091Sm 13:1 Saul was... years old when he began to reign, and he reigned... and two years over Israel.
091Sm 13:2 Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.
091Sm 13:3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear."
091Sm 13:4 And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
091Sm 13:5 And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
091Sm 13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns,
091Sm 13:7 and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
091Sm 13:8 He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.
091Sm 13:9 So Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.
091Sm 13:10 As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and greet him.
091Sm 13:11 Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,
091Sm 13:12 I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.' So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering."
091Sm 13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, with which he commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
091Sm 13:14 But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."
091Sm 13:15 And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal. The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
091Sm 13:16 And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
091Sm 13:17 And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
091Sm 13:18 another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
091Sm 13:19 Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears."
091Sm 13:20 But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle,
091Sm 13:21 and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.
091Sm 13:22 So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
091Sm 13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
091Sm 14:1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
091Sm 14:2 Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men,
091Sm 14:3 including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
091Sm 14:4 Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
091Sm 14:5 The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
091Sm 14:6 Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few."
091Sm 14:7 And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul."
091Sm 14:8 Then Jonathan said, "Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
091Sm 14:9 If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
091Sm 14:10 But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us."
091Sm 14:11 So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves."
091Sm 14:12 And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."
091Sm 14:13 Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him.
091Sm 14:14 And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
091Sm 14:15 And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.
091Sm 14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there.
091Sm 14:17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Count and see who has gone from us." And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
091Sm 14:18 So Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.
091Sm 14:19 Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
091Sm 14:20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.
091Sm 14:21 Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
091Sm 14:22 Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.
091Sm 14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.
091Sm 14:24 And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people had tasted food.
091Sm 14:25 Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground.
091Sm 14:26 And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
091Sm 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.
091Sm 14:28 Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'" And the people were faint.
091Sm 14:29 Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.
091Sm 14:30 How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great."
091Sm 14:31 They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.
091Sm 14:32 The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.
091Sm 14:33 Then they told Saul, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here."
091Sm 14:34 And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, 'Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there.
091Sm 14:35 And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
091Sm 14:36 Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here."
091Sm 14:37 And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.
091Sm 14:38 And Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.
091Sm 14:39 For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
091Sm 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
091Sm 14:41 Therefore Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.
091Sm 14:42 Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And Jonathan was taken.
091Sm 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." And Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die."
091Sm 14:44 And Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan."
091Sm 14:45 Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die.
091Sm 14:46 Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
091Sm 14:47 When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them.
091Sm 14:48 And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
091Sm 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
091Sm 14:50 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
091Sm 14:51 Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
091Sm 14:52 There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.
091Sm 15:1 And Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.
091Sm 15:2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.
091Sm 15:3 Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
091Sm 15:4 So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
091Sm 15:5 And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
091Sm 15:6 Then Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
091Sm 15:7 And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
091Sm 15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.
091Sm 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.
091Sm 15:10 The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
091Sm 15:11 "I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments." And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night.
091Sm 15:12 And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal."
091Sm 15:13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
091Sm 15:14 And Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
091Sm 15:15 Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction."
091Sm 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night." And he said to him, "Speak."
091Sm 15:17 And Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
091Sm 15:18 And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, 'Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'
091Sm 15:19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
091Sm 15:20 And Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
091Sm 15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
091Sm 15:22 And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
091Sm 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."
091Sm 15:24 Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
091Sm 15:25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may worship the LORD."
091Sm 15:26 And Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
091Sm 15:27 As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
091Sm 15:28 And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
091Sm 15:29 And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret."
091Sm 15:30 Then he said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God."
091Sm 15:31 So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.
091Sm 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
091Sm 15:33 And Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
091Sm 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
091Sm 15:35 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
091Sm 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons."
091Sm 16:2 And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
091Sm 16:3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you."
091Sm 16:4 Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said, "Do you come peaceably?"
091Sm 16:5 And he said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice." And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
091Sm 16:6 When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed is before him."
091Sm 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."
091Sm 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
091Sm 16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
091Sm 16:10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
091Sm 16:11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here."
091Sm 16:12 And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him, for this is he."
091Sm 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
091Sm 16:14 Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him.
091Sm 16:15 And Saul's servants said to him, "Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
091Sm 16:16 Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well."
091Sm 16:17 So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me."
091Sm 16:18 One of the young men answered, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, and the LORD is with him."
091Sm 16:19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
091Sm 16:20 And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul.
091Sm 16:21 And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
091Sm 16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight."
091Sm 16:23 And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.
091Sm 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
091Sm 17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines.
091Sm 17:3 And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
091Sm 17:4 And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
091Sm 17:5 He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.
091Sm 17:6 And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
091Sm 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.
091Sm 17:8 He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
091Sm 17:9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us."
091Sm 17:10 And the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together."
091Sm 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
091Sm 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.
091Sm 17:13 The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
091Sm 17:14 David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul,
091Sm 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
091Sm 17:16 For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.
091Sm 17:17 And Jesse said to David his son, "Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
091Sm 17:18 Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them."
091Sm 17:19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
091Sm 17:20 And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry.
091Sm 17:21 And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.
091Sm 17:22 And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers.
091Sm 17:23 As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.
091Sm 17:24 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid.
091Sm 17:25 And the men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel."
091Sm 17:26 And David said to the men who stood by him, "What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
091Sm 17:27 And the people answered him in the same way, "So shall it be done to the man who kills him."
091Sm 17:28 Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle."
091Sm 17:29 And David said, "What have I done now? Was it not but a word?"
091Sm 17:30 And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.
091Sm 17:31 When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.
091Sm 17:32 And David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
091Sm 17:33 And Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth."
091Sm 17:34 But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock,
091Sm 17:35 I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.
091Sm 17:36 Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God."
091Sm 17:37 And David said, "The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you!"
091Sm 17:38 Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail,
091Sm 17:39 and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them." So David put them off.
091Sm 17:40 Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.
091Sm 17:41 And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.
091Sm 17:42 And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.
091Sm 17:43 And the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
091Sm 17:44 The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field."
091Sm 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
091Sm 17:46 This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
091Sm 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hand."
091Sm 17:48 When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
091Sm 17:49 And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
091Sm 17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David.
091Sm 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
091Sm 17:52 And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.
091Sm 17:53 And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
091Sm 17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
091Sm 17:55 As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."
091Sm 17:56 And the king said, "Inquire whose son the boy is."
091Sm 17:57 And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
091Sm 17:58 And Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
091Sm 18:1 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
091Sm 18:2 And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
091Sm 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.
091Sm 18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
091Sm 18:5 And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him, so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
091Sm 18:6 As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.
091Sm 18:7 And the women sang to one another as they celebrated, "Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
091Sm 18:8 And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?"
091Sm 18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day on.
091Sm 18:10 The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand.
091Sm 18:11 And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David evaded him twice.
091Sm 18:12 Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.
091Sm 18:13 So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people.
091Sm 18:14 And David had success in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him.
091Sm 18:15 And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him.
091Sm 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
091Sm 18:17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD's battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him."
091Sm 18:18 And David said to Saul, "Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father's clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
091Sm 18:19 But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
091Sm 18:20 Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
091Sm 18:21 Saul thought, "Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David a second time, "You shall now be my son-in-law."
091Sm 18:22 And Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in private and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king's son-in-law.'"
091Sm 18:23 And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?"
091Sm 18:24 And the servants of Saul told him, "Thus and so did David speak."
091Sm 18:25 Then Saul said, "Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
091Sm 18:26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
091Sm 18:27 David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.
091Sm 18:28 But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,
091Sm 18:29 Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.
091Sm 18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.
091Sm 19:1 And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
091Sm 19:2 And Jonathan told David, "Saul my father seeks to kill you. Therefore be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
091Sm 19:3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. And if I learn anything I will tell you."
091Sm 19:4 And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you.
091Sm 19:5 For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
091Sm 19:6 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."
091Sm 19:7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported to him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
091Sm 19:8 And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, so that they fled before him.
091Sm 19:9 Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing the lyre.
091Sm 19:10 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.
091Sm 19:11 Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, "If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
091Sm 19:12 So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped.
091Sm 19:13 Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with the clothes.
091Sm 19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
091Sm 19:15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
091Sm 19:16 And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
091Sm 19:17 Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal answered Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go. Why should I kill you?'"
091Sm 19:18 Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth.
091Sm 19:19 And it was told Saul, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
091Sm 19:20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
091Sm 19:21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
091Sm 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" And one said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
091Sm 19:23 And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
091Sm 19:24 And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
091Sm 20:2 And he said to him, "Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so."
091Sm 20:3 But David vowed again, saying, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."
091Sm 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
091Sm 20:5 David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.
091Sm 20:6 If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan.'
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'Good!' it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that harm is determined by him.
091Sm 20:8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?"
091Sm 20:9 And Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that harm should come to you, would I not tell you?"
091Sm 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"
091Sm 20:11 And Jonathan said to David, "Come, let us go out into the field." So they both went out into the field.
091Sm 20:12 And Jonathan said to David, "The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?
091Sm 20:13 But should it please my father to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
091Sm 20:14 If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die;
091Sm 20:15 and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."
091Sm 20:16 And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD take vengeance on David's enemies."
091Sm 20:17 And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
091Sm 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
091Sm 20:19 On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap.
091Sm 20:20 And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
091Sm 20:21 And behold, I will send the young man, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the young man, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,' then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
091Sm 20:22 But if I say to the youth, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go, for the LORD has sent you away.
091Sm 20:23 And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever."
091Sm 20:24 So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
091Sm 20:25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.
091Sm 20:26 Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean; surely he is not clean."
091Sm 20:27 But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
091Sm 20:29 He said, 'Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."
091Sm 20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
091Sm 20:31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die."
091Sm 20:32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
091Sm 20:33 But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
091Sm 20:34 And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.
091Sm 20:35 In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy.
091Sm 20:36 And he said to his boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
091Sm 20:37 And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"
091Sm 20:38 And Jonathan called after the boy, "Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!" So Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
091Sm 20:39 But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
091Sm 20:40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, "Go and carry them to the city."
091Sm 20:41 And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most.
091Sm 20:42 Then Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.'" And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.
091Sm 21:1  Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"
091Sm 21:2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, 'Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
091Sm 21:3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here."
091Sm 21:4 And the priest answered David, "I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread--if the young men have kept themselves from women."
091Sm 21:5 And David answered the priest, "Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?"
091Sm 21:6 So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.
091Sm 21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
091Sm 21:8 Then David said to Ahimelech, "Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
091Sm 21:9 And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here." And David said, "There is none like that; give it to me."
091Sm 21:10 And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath.
091Sm 21:11 And the servants of Achish said to him, "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
091Sm 21:12 And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
091Sm 21:13 So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.
091Sm 21:14 Then Achish said to his servants, "Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
091Sm 21:15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
091Sm 22:1 David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
091Sm 22:2 And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
091Sm 22:3 And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me."
091Sm 22:4 And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
091Sm 22:5 Then the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah." So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.
091Sm 22:6 Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
091Sm 22:7 And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, "Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
091Sm 22:8 that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day."
091Sm 22:9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub,
091Sm 22:10 and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
091Sm 22:11 Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king.
091Sm 22:12 And Saul said, "Hear now, son of Ahitub." And he answered, "Here I am, my lord."
091Sm 22:13 And Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
091Sm 22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, "And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house?
091Sm 22:15 Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little."
091Sm 22:16 And the king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house."
091Sm 22:17 And the king said to the guard who stood about him, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and strike the priests." And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
091Sm 22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.
091Sm 22:20 But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
091Sm 22:21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:22 And David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.
091Sm 22:23 Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping."
091Sm 23:1 Now they told David, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors."
091Sm 23:2 Therefore David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" And the LORD said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah."
091Sm 23:3 But David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
091Sm 23:4 Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
091Sm 23:5 And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
091Sm 23:6 When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand.
091Sm 23:7 Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, "God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars."
091Sm 23:8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
091Sm 23:9 David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."
091Sm 23:10 Then said David, "O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.
091Sm 23:11 Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."
091Sm 23:12 Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will surrender you."
091Sm 23:13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.
091Sm 23:14 And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
091Sm 23:15 David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
091Sm 23:16 And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God.
091Sm 23:17 And he said to him, "Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father also knows this."
091Sm 23:18 And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
091Sm 23:19 Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?
091Sm 23:20 Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down, and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand."
091Sm 23:21 And Saul said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me.
091Sm 23:22 Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning.
091Sm 23:23 See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
091Sm 23:24 And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.
091Sm 23:25 And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
091Sm 23:26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them,
091Sm 23:27 a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land."
091Sm 23:28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.
091Sm 23:29  And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi.
091Sm 24:1  When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
091Sm 24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks.
091Sm 24:3 And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.
091Sm 24:4 And the men of David said to him, "Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:5 And afterward David's heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:6 He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD's anointed."
091Sm 24:7 So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.
091Sm 24:8 Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.
091Sm 24:9 And David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of men who say, 'Behold, David seeks your harm'?
091Sm 24:10 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD's anointed.'
091Sm 24:11 See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.
091Sm 24:12 May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you.
091Sm 24:13 As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes wickedness.' But my hand shall not be against you.
091Sm 24:14 After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea!
091Sm 24:15 May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand."
091Sm 24:16 As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
091Sm 24:17 He said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.
091Sm 24:18 And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands.
091Sm 24:19 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
091Sm 24:20 And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
091Sm 24:21 Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house."
091Sm 24:22 And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
091Sm 25:1 Now Samuel died. And all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah. Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
091Sm 25:2 And there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
091Sm 25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and badly behaved; he was a Calebite.
091Sm 25:4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
091Sm 25:5 So David sent ten young men. And David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.
091Sm 25:6 And thus you shall greet him: 'Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
091Sm 25:7 I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel.
091Sm 25:8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'"
091Sm 25:9 When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited.
091Sm 25:10 And Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
091Sm 25:11 Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"
091Sm 25:12 So David's young men turned away and came back and told him all this.
091Sm 25:13 And David said to his men, "Every man strap on his sword!" And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
091Sm 25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them.
091Sm 25:15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them.
091Sm 25:16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
091Sm 25:17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him."
091Sm 25:18 Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
091Sm 25:19 And she said to her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
091Sm 25:20 And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.
091Sm 25:21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
091Sm 25:22 God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him."
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground.
091Sm 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, "On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.
091Sm 25:25 Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
091Sm 25:26 Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, because the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
091Sm 25:27 And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.
091Sm 25:29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
091Sm 25:30 And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel,
091Sm 25:31 my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord taking vengeance himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant."
091Sm 25:32 And David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
091Sm 25:33 Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand!
091Sm 25:34 For as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male."
091Sm 25:35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. See, I have obeyed your voice, and I have granted your petition."
091Sm 25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
091Sm 25:37 In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
091Sm 25:38 And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD who has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head." Then David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
091Sm 25:40 When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."
091Sm 25:41 And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, "Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
091Sm 25:42 And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey, and her five young women attended her. She followed the messengers of David and became his wife.
091Sm 25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.
091Sm 25:44 Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
091Sm 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?"
091Sm 26:2 So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
091Sm 26:3 And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,
091Sm 26:4 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come.
091Sm 26:5 Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.
091Sm 26:6 Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
091Sm 26:7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him.
091Sm 26:8 Then said Abishai to David, "God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice."
091Sm 26:9 But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?"
091Sm 26:10 And David said, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish.
091Sm 26:11 The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD's anointed. But take now the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go."
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
091Sm 26:13 Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them.
091Sm 26:14 And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered, "Who are you who calls to the king?"
091Sm 26:15 And David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
091Sm 26:16 This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is and the jar of water that was at his head."
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."
091Sm 26:18 And he said, "Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands?
091Sm 26:19 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
091Sm 26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains."
091Sm 26:21 Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake."
091Sm 26:22 And David answered and said, "Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it.
091Sm 26:23 The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD's anointed.
091Sm 26:24 Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation."
091Sm 26:25 Then Saul said to David, "Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them." So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
091Sm 27:1 Then David said in his heart, "Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand."
091Sm 27:2 So David arose and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
091Sm 27:3 And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
091Sm 27:4 And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.
091Sm 27:5 Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
091Sm 27:6 So that day Achish gave him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
091Sm 27:7 And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
091Sm 27:8 Now David and his men went up and made raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.
091Sm 27:9 And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish.
091Sm 27:10 When Achish asked, "Where have you made a raid today?" David would say, "Against the Negeb of Judah," or, "Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites," or, "Against the Negeb of the Kenites."
091Sm 27:11 And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, "lest they should tell about us and say, 'So David has done.'" Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines.
091Sm 27:12 And Achish trusted David, thinking, "He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant."
091Sm 28:1 In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, "Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army."
091Sm 28:2 David said to Achish, "Very well, you shall know what your servant can do." And Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
091Sm 28:3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land.
091Sm 28:4 The Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
091Sm 28:6 And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
091Sm 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a medium at En-dor."
091Sm 28:8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, "Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you."
091Sm 28:9 The woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?"
091Sm 28:10 But Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing."
091Sm 28:11 Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He said, "Bring up Samuel for me."
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul."
091Sm 28:13 The king said to her, "Do not be afraid. What do you see?" And the woman said to Saul, "I see a god coming up out of the earth."
091Sm 28:14 He said to her, "What is his appearance?" And she said, "An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe." And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.
091Sm 28:15 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do."
091Sm 28:16 And Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?
091Sm 28:17 The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
091Sm 28:18 Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.
091Sm 28:19 Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 28:20 Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
091Sm 28:21 And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, "Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me.
091Sm 28:22 Now therefore, you also obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way."
091Sm 28:23 He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.
091Sm 28:24 Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,
091Sm 28:25 and she put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
091Sm 29:1 Now the Philistines had gathered all their forces at Aphek. And the Israelites were encamped by the spring that is in Jezreel.
091Sm 29:2 As the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear with Achish,
091Sm 29:3 the commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years, and since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day."
091Sm 29:4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him. And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?
091Sm 29:5 Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
091Sm 29:6 Then Achish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign. For I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you.
091Sm 29:7 So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines."
091Sm 29:8 And David said to Achish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
091Sm 29:9 And Achish answered David and said, "I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
091Sm 29:10 Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you, and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light."
091Sm 29:11 So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
091Sm 30:1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid against the Negeb and against Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire
091Sm 30:2 and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.
091Sm 30:3 And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
091Sm 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.
091Sm 30:5 David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
091Sm 30:6 And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
091Sm 30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
091Sm 30:8 And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue, for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue."
091Sm 30:9 So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
091Sm 30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men. Two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
091Sm 30:11 They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. And they gave him bread and he ate. They gave him water to drink,
091Sm 30:12 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
091Sm 30:13 And David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you from?" He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite, and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
091Sm 30:14 We had made a raid against the Negeb of the Cherethites and against that which belongs to Judah and against the Negeb of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire."
091Sm 30:15 And David said to him, "Will you take me down to this band?" And he said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band."
091Sm 30:16 And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
091Sm 30:17 And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.
091Sm 30:18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.
091Sm 30:19 Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken. David brought back all.
091Sm 30:20 David also captured all the flocks and herds, and the people drove the livestock before him, and said, "This is David's spoil."
091Sm 30:21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor. And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people he greeted them.
091Sm 30:22 Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart."
091Sm 30:23 But David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us.
091Sm 30:24 Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall share alike."
091Sm 30:25 And he made it a statute and a rule for Israel from that day forward to this day.
091Sm 30:26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD."
091Sm 30:27 It was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,
091Sm 30:28 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoa,
091Sm 30:29 in Racal, in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites,
091Sm 30:30 in Hormah, in Bor-ashan, in Athach,
091Sm 30:31 in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
091Sm 31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
091Sm 31:3 The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by the archers.
091Sm 31:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
091Sm 31:5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
091Sm 31:6 Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together.
091Sm 31:7 And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. And the Philistines came and lived in them.
091Sm 31:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:9 So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people.
091Sm 31:10 They put his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
091Sm 31:11 But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
091Sm 31:12 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
091Sm 31:13 And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted seven days.

102Sm 1:1 After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
102Sm 1:2 And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage.
102Sm 1:3 David said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."
102Sm 1:4 And David said to him, "How did it go? Tell me." And he answered, "The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."
102Sm 1:5 Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
102Sm 1:6 And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
102Sm 1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, 'Here I am.'
102Sm 1:8 And he said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
102Sm 1:9 And he said to me 'Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.'
102Sm 1:10 So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."
102Sm 1:11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.
102Sm 1:12 And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
102Sm 1:13 And David said to the young man who told him, "Where do you come from?" And he answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite."
102Sm 1:14 David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
102Sm 1:15 Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, execute him." And he struck him down so that he died.
102Sm 1:16 And David said to him, "Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'"
102Sm 1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,
102Sm 1:18 and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:
102Sm 1:19 "Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
102Sm 1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
102Sm 1:21 "You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields of offerings! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
102Sm 1:22 "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
102Sm 1:23 "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions.
102Sm 1:24 "You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
102Sm 1:25 "How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! "Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
102Sm 1:26 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
102Sm 1:27 "How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
102Sm 2:1 After this David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." David said, "To which shall I go up?" And he said, "To Hebron."
102Sm 2:2 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
102Sm 2:3 And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron.
102Sm 2:4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When they told David, "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,"
102Sm 2:5 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, "May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him.
102Sm 2:6 Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing.
102Sm 2:7 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
102Sm 2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim,
102Sm 2:9 and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel.
102Sm 2:10 Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
102Sm 2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
102Sm 2:12 Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
102Sm 2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
102Sm 2:14 And Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men arise and compete before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise."
102Sm 2:15 Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
102Sm 2:16 And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon.
102Sm 2:17 And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
102Sm 2:18 And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle.
102Sm 2:19 And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
102Sm 2:20 Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is it you, Asahel?" And he answered, "It is I."
102Sm 2:21 Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil." But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
102Sm 2:22 And Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?"
102Sm 2:23 But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
102Sm 2:24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
102Sm 2:25 And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill.
102Sm 2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?"
102Sm 2:27 And Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning."
102Sm 2:28 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.
102Sm 2:29 And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim.
102Sm 2:30 Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
102Sm 2:31 But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men.
102Sm 2:32 And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
102Sm 3:1 There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
102Sm 3:2 And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
102Sm 3:3 and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
102Sm 3:4 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
102Sm 3:5 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
102Sm 3:6 While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
102Sm 3:7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
102Sm 3:8 Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.
102Sm 3:9 God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him,
102Sm 3:10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."
102Sm 3:11 And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
102Sm 3:12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you."
102Sm 3:13 And he said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."
102Sm 3:14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
102Sm 3:15 And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.
102Sm 3:16 But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return." And he returned.
102Sm 3:17 And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
102Sm 3:18 Now then bring it about, for the LORD has promised David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
102Sm 3:19 Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
102Sm 3:20 When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
102Sm 3:21 And Abner said to David, "I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
102Sm 3:22 Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
102Sm 3:23 When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace."
102Sm 3:24 Then Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?
102Sm 3:25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing."
102Sm 3:26 When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it.
102Sm 3:27 And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
102Sm 3:28 Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
102Sm 3:29 May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!"
102Sm 3:30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
102Sm 3:31 Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner." And King David followed the bier.
102Sm 3:32 They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
102Sm 3:33 And the king lamented for Abner, saying, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?
102Sm 3:34 Your hands were not bound; your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him.
102Sm 3:35 Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, "God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!"
102Sm 3:36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people.
102Sm 3:37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to put to death Abner the son of Ner.
102Sm 3:38 And the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
102Sm 3:39 And I was gentle today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!"
102Sm 4:1 When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
102Sm 4:2 Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Beeroth (for Beeroth also is counted part of Benjamin;
102Sm 4:3 the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day).
102Sm 4:4 Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
102Sm 4:5 Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest.
102Sm 4:6 And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
102Sm 4:7 When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night,
102Sm 4:8 and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring."
102Sm 4:9 But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
102Sm 4:10 when one told me, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
102Sm 4:11 How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?"
102Sm 4:12 And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
102Sm 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
102Sm 5:2 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.'"
102Sm 5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
102Sm 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
102Sm 5:5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
102Sm 5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, "You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off"--thinking, "David cannot come in here."
102Sm 5:7 Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
102Sm 5:8 And David said on that day, "Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack 'the lame and the blind,' who are hated by David's soul." Therefore it is said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
102Sm 5:9 And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
102Sm 5:10 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
102Sm 5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.
102Sm 5:12 And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
102Sm 5:13 And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
102Sm 5:14 And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
102Sm 5:17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
102Sm 5:18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:19 And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to David, "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."
102Sm 5:20 And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. And he said, "The LORD has burst through my enemies before me like a bursting flood." Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
102Sm 5:21 And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
102Sm 5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:23 And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, "You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
102Sm 5:24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then rouse yourself, for then the LORD has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
102Sm 5:25 And David did as the LORD commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.
102Sm 6:1 David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
102Sm 6:2 And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim.
102Sm 6:3 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart,
102Sm 6:4 with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.
102Sm 6:5 And David and all the house of Israel were making merry before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.
102Sm 6:6 And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
102Sm 6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God.
102Sm 6:8 And David was angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah, to this day.
102Sm 6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"
102Sm 6:10 So David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
102Sm 6:11 And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
102Sm 6:12 And it was told King David, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing.
102Sm 6:13 And when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.
102Sm 6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod.
102Sm 6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn.
102Sm 6:16 As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.
102Sm 6:17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
102Sm 6:18 And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts
102Sm 6:19 and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed, each to his house.
102Sm 6:20 And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' female servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
102Sm 6:21 And David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the LORD--and I will make merry before the LORD.
102Sm 6:22 I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes. But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor."
102Sm 6:23 And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
102Sm 7:1 Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
102Sm 7:2 the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent."
102Sm 7:3 And Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you."
102Sm 7:4 But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,
102Sm 7:5 "Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD: Would you build me a house to dwell in?
102Sm 7:6 I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling.
102Sm 7:7 In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
102Sm 7:8 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.
102Sm 7:9 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
102Sm 7:10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
102Sm 7:11 from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.
102Sm 7:12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
102Sm 7:13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
102Sm 7:14 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
102Sm 7:15 but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
102Sm 7:16 And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.'"
102Sm 7:17 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
102Sm 7:19 And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. You have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!
102Sm 7:20 And what more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Lord GOD!
102Sm 7:21 Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have brought about all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
102Sm 7:22 Therefore you are great, O LORD God. For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
102Sm 7:23 And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name and doing for them great and awesome things by driving out before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods?
102Sm 7:24 And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O LORD, became their God.
102Sm 7:25 And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.
102Sm 7:26 And your name will be magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,' and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
102Sm 7:27 For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
102Sm 7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
102Sm 7:29 Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever."
102Sm 8:1 After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
102Sm 8:2 And he defeated Moab and he measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground. Two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
102Sm 8:3 David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the river Euphrates.
102Sm 8:4 And David took from him 1,700 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left enough for 100 chariots.
102Sm 8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians.
102Sm 8:6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
102Sm 8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
102Sm 8:8 And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took very much bronze.
102Sm 8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer,
102Sm 8:10 Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold, and of bronze.
102Sm 8:11 These also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he subdued,
102Sm 8:12 from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
102Sm 8:13 And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
102Sm 8:14 Then he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
102Sm 8:15 So David reigned over all Israel. And David administered justice and equity to all his people.
102Sm 8:16 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder,
102Sm 8:17 and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary,
102Sm 8:18 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David's sons were priests.
102Sm 9:1 And David said, "Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
102Sm 9:2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "I am your servant."
102Sm 9:3 And the king said, "Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?" Ziba said to the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet."
102Sm 9:4 The king said to him, "Where is he?" And Ziba said to the king, "He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar."
102Sm 9:5 Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
102Sm 9:6 And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, "Mephibosheth!" And he answered, "Behold, I am your servant."
102Sm 9:7 And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always."
102Sm 9:8 And he paid homage and said, "What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?"
102Sm 9:9 Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson.
102Sm 9:10 And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master's grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master's grandson shall always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
102Sm 9:11 Then Ziba said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table, like one of the king's sons.
102Sm 9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants.
102Sm 9:13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate always at the king's table. Now he was lame in both his feet.
102Sm 10:1 After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
102Sm 10:2 And David said, "I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me." So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites.
102Sm 10:3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?"
102Sm 10:4 So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away.
102Sm 10:5 When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return."
102Sm 10:6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob, 12,000 men.
102Sm 10:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men.
102Sm 10:8 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
102Sm 10:9 When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
102Sm 10:10 The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
102Sm 10:11 And he said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
102Sm 10:12 Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him."
102Sm 10:13 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
102Sm 10:14 And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
102Sm 10:15 But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
102Sm 10:16 And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates. They came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
102Sm 10:17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him.
102Sm 10:18 And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
102Sm 10:19 And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.
102Sm 11:1 In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
102Sm 11:2 It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
102Sm 11:3 And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
102Sm 11:4 So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.
102Sm 11:5 And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, "I am pregnant."
102Sm 11:6 So David sent word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David.
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going.
102Sm 11:8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
102Sm 11:10 When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
102Sm 11:11 Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."
102Sm 11:12 Then David said to Uriah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
102Sm 11:13 And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
102Sm 11:14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
102Sm 11:15 In the letter he wrote, "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."
102Sm 11:16 And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
102Sm 11:17 And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died.
102Sm 11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting.
102Sm 11:19 And he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,
102Sm 11:20 then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
102Sm 11:21 Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
102Sm 11:22 So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
102Sm 11:23 The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
102Sm 11:24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
102Sm 11:25 David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.' And encourage him."
102Sm 11:26 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband.
102Sm 11:27 And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
102Sm 12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
102Sm 12:2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
102Sm 12:3 but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him.
102Sm 12:4 Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him."
102Sm 12:5 Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die,
102Sm 12:6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
102Sm 12:7 Nathan said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
102Sm 12:8 And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.
102Sm 12:9 Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
102Sm 12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'
102Sm 12:11 Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
102Sm 12:12 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.'"
102Sm 12:13 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
102Sm 12:14 Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die."
102Sm 12:15 Then Nathan went to his house. And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he became sick.
102Sm 12:16 David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.
102Sm 12:17 And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
102Sm 12:18 On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm."
102Sm 12:19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."
102Sm 12:20 Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.
102Sm 12:21 Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food."
102Sm 12:22 He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, 'Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'
102Sm 12:23 But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
102Sm 12:24 Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him
102Sm 12:25 and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
102Sm 12:26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
102Sm 12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.
102Sm 12:28 Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name."
102Sm 12:29 So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.
102Sm 12:30 And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
102Sm 12:31 And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 13:1 Now Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her.
102Sm 13:2 And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
102Sm 13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
102Sm 13:4 And he said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
102Sm 13:5 Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.'"
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
102Sm 13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him."
102Sm 13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
102Sm 13:9 And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Send out everyone from me." So everyone went out from him.
102Sm 13:10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
102Sm 13:11 But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."
102Sm 13:12 She answered him, "No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing.
102Sm 13:13 As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you."
102Sm 13:14 But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
102Sm 13:15 Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Get up! Go!"
102Sm 13:16 But she said to him, "No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me." But he would not listen to her.
102Sm 13:17 He called the young man who served him and said, "Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her."
102Sm 13:18 Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
102Sm 13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
102Sm 13:20 And her brother Absalom said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart." So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
102Sm 13:22 But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:23 After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
102Sm 13:24 And Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant."
102Sm 13:25 But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
102Sm 13:26 Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
102Sm 13:28 Then Absalom commanded his servants, "Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant."
102Sm 13:29 So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
102Sm 13:30 While they were on the way, news came to David, "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left."
102Sm 13:31 Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.
102Sm 13:32 But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:33 Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead."
102Sm 13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
102Sm 13:35 And Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about."
102Sm 13:36 And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
102Sm 13:37 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.
102Sm 13:38 So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
102Sm 13:39 And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.
102Sm 14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart went out to Absalom.
102Sm 14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, "Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
102Sm 14:3 Go to the king and speak thus to him." So Joab put the words in her mouth.
102Sm 14:4 When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, "Save me, O king."
102Sm 14:5 And the king said to her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
102Sm 14:6 And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
102Sm 14:7 And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth."
102Sm 14:8 Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."
102Sm 14:9 And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, "On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless."
102Sm 14:10 The king said, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again."
102Sm 14:11 Then she said, "Please let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed." He said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."
102Sm 14:12 Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." He said, "Speak."
102Sm 14:13 And the woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.
102Sm 14:14 We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast.
102Sm 14:15 Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
102Sm 14:16 For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.'
102Sm 14:17 And your servant thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,' for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!"
102Sm 14:18 Then the king answered the woman, "Do not hide from me anything I ask you." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."
102Sm 14:19 The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.
102Sm 14:20 In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth."
102Sm 14:21 Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom."
102Sm 14:22 And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant."
102Sm 14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
102Sm 14:24 And the king said, "Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king's presence.
102Sm 14:25 Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
102Sm 14:26 And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
102Sm 14:27 There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.
102Sm 14:28 So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence.
102Sm 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.
102Sm 14:30 Then he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
102Sm 14:31 Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
102Sm 14:32 Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent word to you, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still." Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.'"
102Sm 14:33 Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
102Sm 15:1 After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
102Sm 15:2 And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, "From what city are you?" And when he said, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,"
102Sm 15:3 Absalom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you."
102Sm 15:4 Then Absalom would say, "Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice."
102Sm 15:5 And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
102Sm 15:6 Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
102Sm 15:7 And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
102Sm 15:8 For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.'"
102Sm 15:9 The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron.
102Sm 15:10 But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, 'Absalom is king at Hebron!'"
102Sm 15:11 With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing.
102Sm 15:12 And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.
102Sm 15:13 And a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom."
102Sm 15:14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
102Sm 15:15 And the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides."
102Sm 15:16 So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house.
102Sm 15:17 And the king went out, and all the people after him. And they halted at the last house.
102Sm 15:18 And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.
102Sm 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home.
102Sm 15:20 You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you."
102Sm 15:21 But Ittai answered the king, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be."
102Sm 15:22 And David said to Ittai, "Go then, pass on." So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
102Sm 15:23 And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.
102Sm 15:24 And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city.
102Sm 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place.
102Sm 15:26 But if he says, 'I have no pleasure in you,' behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him."
102Sm 15:27 The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
102Sm 15:28 See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
102Sm 15:30 But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.
102Sm 15:31 And it was told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
102Sm 15:32 While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head.
102Sm 15:33 David said to him, "If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
102Sm 15:34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
102Sm 15:35 Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
102Sm 15:36 Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear."
102Sm 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
102Sm 16:1 When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
102Sm 16:2 And the king said to Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink."
102Sm 16:3 And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'"
102Sm 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." And Ziba said, "I pay homage; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king."
102Sm 16:5 When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, and as he came he cursed continually.
102Sm 16:6 And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
102Sm 16:7 And Shimei said as he cursed, "Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!
102Sm 16:8 The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood."
102Sm 16:9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."
102Sm 16:10 But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David,' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
102Sm 16:11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
102Sm 16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today."
102Sm 16:13 So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust.
102Sm 16:14 And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan. And there he refreshed himself.
102Sm 16:15 Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
102Sm 16:16 And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
102Sm 16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
102Sm 16:18 And Hushai said to Absalom, "No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.
102Sm 16:19 And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you."
102Sm 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your counsel. What shall we do?"
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."
102Sm 16:22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
102Sm 16:23 Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.
102Sm 17:1 Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.
102Sm 17:2 I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king,
102Sm 17:3 and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace."
102Sm 17:4 And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
102Sm 17:5 Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say."
102Sm 17:6 And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, "Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak."
102Sm 17:7 Then Hushai said to Absalom, "This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good."
102Sm 17:8 Hushai said, "You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people.
102Sm 17:9 Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'
102Sm 17:10 Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men.
102Sm 17:11 But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.
102Sm 17:12 So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left.
102Sm 17:13 If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there."
102Sm 17:14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.
102Sm 17:15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled.
102Sm 17:16 Now therefore send quickly and tell David, 'Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.'"
102Sm 17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city.
102Sm 17:18 But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it.
102Sm 17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it.
102Sm 17:20 When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman said to them, "They have gone over the brook of water." And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 17:21 After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, "Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you."
102Sm 17:22 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
102Sm 17:23 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.
102Sm 17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
102Sm 17:25 Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
102Sm 17:26 And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
102Sm 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
102Sm 17:28 brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils,
102Sm 17:29 honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness."
102Sm 18:1 Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
102Sm 18:2 And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, "I myself will also go out with you."
102Sm 18:3 But the men said, "You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city."
102Sm 18:4 The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
102Sm 18:5 And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
102Sm 18:6 So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
102Sm 18:7 And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.
102Sm 18:8 The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.
102Sm 18:9 And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.
102Sm 18:10 And a certain man saw it and told Joab, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
102Sm 18:11 Joab said to the man who told him, "What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt."
102Sm 18:12 But the man said to Joab, "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake protect the young man Absalom.'
102Sm 18:13 On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof."
102Sm 18:14 Joab said, "I will not waste time like this with you." And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak.
102Sm 18:15 And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.
102Sm 18:16 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them.
102Sm 18:17 And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home.
102Sm 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance." He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.
102Sm 18:19 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."
102Sm 18:20 And Joab said to him, "You are not to carry news today. You may carry news another day, but today you shall carry no news, because the king's son is dead."
102Sm 18:21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran.
102Sm 18:22 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, "Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?"
102Sm 18:23 "Come what may," he said, "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.
102Sm 18:24 Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone.
102Sm 18:25 The watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, "If he is alone, there is news in his mouth." And he drew nearer and nearer.
102Sm 18:26 The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, "See, another man running alone!" The king said, "He also brings news."
102Sm 18:27 The watchman said, "I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok." And the king said, "He is a good man and comes with good news."
102Sm 18:28 Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, "All is well." And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king."
102Sm 18:29 And the king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was."
102Sm 18:30 And the king said, "Turn aside and stand here." So he turned aside and stood still.
102Sm 18:31 And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, "Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you."
102Sm 18:32 The king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And the Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man."
102Sm 18:33  And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:1 It was told Joab, "Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."
102Sm 19:2 So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard that day, "The king is grieving for his son."
102Sm 19:3 And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle.
102Sm 19:4 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:5 Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, "You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines,
102Sm 19:6 because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you, for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.
102Sm 19:7 Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now."
102Sm 19:8 Then the king arose and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate." And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his own home.
102Sm 19:9 And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
102Sm 19:10 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
102Sm 19:11 And King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: "Say to the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king?
102Sm 19:12 You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?'
102Sm 19:13 And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if you are not commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.'"
102Sm 19:14 And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, "Return, both you and all your servants."
102Sm 19:15 So the king came back to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.
102Sm 19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
102Sm 19:17 And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king,
102Sm 19:18 and they crossed the ford to bring over the king's household and to do his pleasure. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan,
102Sm 19:19 and said to the king, "Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Do not let the king take it to heart.
102Sm 19:20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."
102Sm 19:21 Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
102Sm 19:22 But David said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be as an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?"
102Sm 19:23 And the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king gave him his oath.
102Sm 19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety.
102Sm 19:25 And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
102Sm 19:26 He answered, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said to him, 'I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go with the king.' For your servant is lame.
102Sm 19:27 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.
102Sm 19:28 For all my father's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?"
102Sm 19:29 And the king said to him, "Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land."
102Sm 19:30 And Mephibosheth said to the king, "Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home."
102Sm 19:31 Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.
102Sm 19:32 Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
102Sm 19:33 And the king said to Barzillai, "Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem."
102Sm 19:34 But Barzillai said to the king, "How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
102Sm 19:35 I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
102Sm 19:36 Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
102Sm 19:37 Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you."
102Sm 19:38 And the king answered, "Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you."
102Sm 19:39 Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.
102Sm 19:40 The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
102Sm 19:41 Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, "Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"
102Sm 19:42 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king is our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?"
102Sm 19:43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
102Sm 20:1 Now there happened to be there a worthless man, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. And he blew the trumpet and said, "We have no portion in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel!"
102Sm 20:2 So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.
102Sm 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself."
102Sm 20:5 So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him.
102Sm 20:6 And David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us."
102Sm 20:7 And there went out after him Joab's men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:8 When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh, and as he went forward it fell out.
102Sm 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
102Sm 20:10 But Amasa did not observe the sword that was in Joab's hand. So Joab struck him with it in the stomach and spilled his entrails to the ground without striking a second blow, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:11 And one of Joab's young men took his stand by Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab."
102Sm 20:12 And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And anyone who came by, seeing him, stopped. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him.
102Sm 20:13 When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:14 And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah, and all the Bichrites assembled and followed him in.
102Sm 20:15 And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah. They cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart, and they were battering the wall to throw it down.
102Sm 20:16 Then a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, 'Come here, that I may speak to you.'"
102Sm 20:17 And he came near her, and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" He answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." And he answered, "I am listening."
102Sm 20:18 Then she said, "They used to say in former times, 'Let them but ask counsel at Abel,' and so they settled a matter.
102Sm 20:19 I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?"
102Sm 20:20 Joab answered, "Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy!
102Sm 20:21 That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab, "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
102Sm 20:22 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
102Sm 20:23 Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
102Sm 20:24 and Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
102Sm 20:25 and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
102Sm 20:26 and Ira the Jairite was also David's priest.
102Sm 21:1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, "There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death."
102Sm 21:2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the people of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites. Although the people of Israel had sworn to spare them, Saul had sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.
102Sm 21:3 And David said to the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? And how shall I make atonement, that you may bless the heritage of the LORD?"
102Sm 21:4 The Gibeonites said to him, "It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." And he said, "What do you say that I shall do for you?"
102Sm 21:5 They said to the king, "The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel,
102Sm 21:6 let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD." And the king said, "I will give them."
102Sm 21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
102Sm 21:8 The king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
102Sm 21:9 and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD, and the seven of them perished together. They were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest.
102Sm 21:10 Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day, or the beasts of the field by night.
102Sm 21:11 When David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
102Sm 21:12 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.
102Sm 21:13 And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
102Sm 21:14 And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they did all that the king commanded. And after that God responded to the plea for the land.
102Sm 21:15 There was war again between the Philistines and Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary.
102Sm 21:16 And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze, and who was armed with a new sword, thought to kill David.
102Sm 21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, "You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel."
102Sm 21:18 After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants.
102Sm 21:19 And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
102Sm 21:20 And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
102Sm 21:21 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
102Sm 21:22 These four were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
102Sm 22:1 And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
102Sm 22:2 He said, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
102Sm 22:3 my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
102Sm 22:4 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
102Sm 22:5 "For the waves of death encompassed me, the torrents of destruction assailed me;
102Sm 22:6 the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
102Sm 22:7 "In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I called. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry came to his ears.
102Sm 22:8 "Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
102Sm 22:9 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
102Sm 22:10 He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
102Sm 22:11 He rode on a cherub and flew; he was seen on the wings of the wind.
102Sm 22:12 He made darkness around him his canopy, thick clouds, a gathering of water.
102Sm 22:13 Out of the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth.
102Sm 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
102Sm 22:15 And he sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning, and routed them.
102Sm 22:16 Then the channels of the sea were seen; the foundations of the world were laid bare, at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
102Sm 22:17 "He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
102Sm 22:19 They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.
102Sm 22:20 He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.
102Sm 22:21 "The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.
102Sm 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.
102Sm 22:23 For all his rules were before me, and from his statutes I did not turn aside.
102Sm 22:24 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
102Sm 22:25 And the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.
102Sm 22:26 "With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;
102Sm 22:27 with the purified you deal purely, and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.
102Sm 22:28 You save a humble people, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down.
102Sm 22:29 For you are my lamp, O LORD, and my God lightens my darkness.
102Sm 22:30 For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
102Sm 22:31 This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
102Sm 22:32 "For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?
102Sm 22:33 This God is my strong refuge and has made my way blameless.
102Sm 22:34 He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
102Sm 22:35 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
102Sm 22:36 You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your gentleness made me great.
102Sm 22:37 You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip;
102Sm 22:38 I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.
102Sm 22:39 I consumed them; I thrust them through, so that they did not rise; they fell under my feet.
102Sm 22:40 For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
102Sm 22:41 You made my enemies turn their backs to me, those who hated me, and I destroyed them.
102Sm 22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
102Sm 22:43 I beat them fine as the dust of the earth; I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.
102Sm 22:44 "You delivered me from strife with my people; you kept me as the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
102Sm 22:45 Foreigners came cringing to me; as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.
102Sm 22:46 Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.
102Sm 22:47 "The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation,
102Sm 22:48 the God who gave me vengeance and brought down peoples under me,
102Sm 22:49 who brought me out from my enemies; you exalted me above those who rose against me; you delivered me from men of violence.
102Sm 22:50 "For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.
102Sm 22:51 Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever."
102Sm 23:1 Now these are the last words of David: The oracle of David, the son of Jesse, the oracle of the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
102Sm 23:2 "The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me; his word is on my tongue.
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel has spoken; the Rock of Israel has said to me: When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of God,
102Sm 23:4 he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth.
102Sm 23:5 "For does not my house stand so with God? For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?
102Sm 23:6 But worthless men are all like thorns that are thrown away, for they cannot be taken with the hand;
102Sm 23:7 but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire."
102Sm 23:8 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
102Sm 23:9 And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew.
102Sm 23:10 He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.
102Sm 23:11 And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines.
102Sm 23:12 But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory.
102Sm 23:13 And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 23:14 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
102Sm 23:15 And David said longingly, "Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
102Sm 23:16 Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the LORD
102Sm 23:17 and said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
102Sm 23:18 Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
102Sm 23:19 He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
102Sm 23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
102Sm 23:21 And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
102Sm 23:22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.
102Sm 23:23 He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
102Sm 23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
102Sm 23:25 Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod,
102Sm 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa,
102Sm 23:27 Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
102Sm 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah,
102Sm 23:29 Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the people of Benjamin,
102Sm 23:30 Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
102Sm 23:31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim,
102Sm 23:32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
102Sm 23:33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
102Sm 23:34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel of Gilo,
102Sm 23:35 Hezro of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite,
102Sm 23:36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
102Sm 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
102Sm 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
102Sm 23:39 Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
102Sm 24:1 Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah."
102Sm 24:2 So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army, who was with him, "Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people."
102Sm 24:3 But Joab said to the king, "May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"
102Sm 24:4 But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.
102Sm 24:5 They crossed the Jordan and began from Aroer, and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.
102Sm 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they went around to Sidon,
102Sm 24:7 and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba.
102Sm 24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
102Sm 24:9 And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.
102Sm 24:10 But David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly."
102Sm 24:11 And when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
102Sm 24:12 "Go and say to David, 'Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"
102Sm 24:13 So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, "Shall three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
102Sm 24:14 Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man."
102Sm 24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men.
102Sm 24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
102Sm 24:17 Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, "Behold, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me and against my father's house."
102Sm 24:18 And Gad came that day to David and said to him, "Go up, raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
102Sm 24:19 So David went up at Gad's word, as the LORD commanded.
102Sm 24:20 And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground.
102Sm 24:21 And Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be averted from the people."
102Sm 24:22 Then Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
102Sm 24:23 All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you."
102Sm 24:24 But the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
102Sm 24:25 And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.
