18
18Jb 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
18Jb 1:2 There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 1:3 He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
18Jb 1:4 His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18Jb 1:5 And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.
18Jb 1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
18Jb 1:7 The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
18Jb 1:8 And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"
18Jb 1:9 Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for no reason?
18Jb 1:10 Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18Jb 1:11 But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."
18Jb 1:12 And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
18Jb 1:13 Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:14 and there came a messenger to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
18Jb 1:15 and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:19 and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:20 Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.
18Jb 1:21 And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
18Jb 1:22 In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
18Jb 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
18Jb 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
18Jb 2:3 And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."
18Jb 2:4 Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
18Jb 2:5 But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."
18Jb 2:6 And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."
18Jb 2:7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
18Jb 2:8 And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
18Jb 2:9 Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."
18Jb 2:10 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
18Jb 2:11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.
18Jb 2:12 And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.
18Jb 2:13 And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
18Jb 3:1 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18Jb 3:2 And Job said:
18Jb 3:3 "Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'
18Jb 3:4 Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.
18Jb 3:5 Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
18Jb 3:6 That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
18Jb 3:7 Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.
18Jb 3:8 Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.
18Jb 3:9 Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,
18Jb 3:10 because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
18Jb 3:11 "Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?
18Jb 3:12 Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?
18Jb 3:13 For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,
18Jb 3:14 with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,
18Jb 3:15 or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18Jb 3:16 Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?
18Jb 3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
18Jb 3:18 There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
18Jb 3:19 The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
18Jb 3:20 "Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
18Jb 3:21 who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
18Jb 3:22 who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?
18Jb 3:23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18Jb 3:24 For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.
18Jb 3:25 For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.
18Jb 3:26 I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."
18Jb 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
18Jb 4:2 "If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking?
18Jb 4:3 Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.
18Jb 4:4 Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.
18Jb 4:5 But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
18Jb 4:6 Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?
18Jb 4:7 "Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?
18Jb 4:8 As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
18Jb 4:9 By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
18Jb 4:10 The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken.
18Jb 4:11 The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18Jb 4:12 "Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it.
18Jb 4:13 Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
18Jb 4:14 dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
18Jb 4:15 A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
18Jb 4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:
18Jb 4:17 'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
18Jb 4:18 Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;
18Jb 4:19 how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.
18Jb 4:20 Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
18Jb 4:21 Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'
18Jb 5:1 "Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
18Jb 5:2 Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.
18Jb 5:3 I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
18Jb 5:4 His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.
18Jb 5:5 The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
18Jb 5:6 For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
18Jb 5:7 but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
18Jb 5:8 "As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,
18Jb 5:9 who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:
18Jb 5:10 he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
18Jb 5:11 he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
18Jb 5:12 He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
18Jb 5:13 He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
18Jb 5:14 They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.
18Jb 5:15 But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.
18Jb 5:16 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
18Jb 5:17 "Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty.
18Jb 5:18 For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.
18Jb 5:19 He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.
18Jb 5:20 In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
18Jb 5:21 You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
18Jb 5:22 At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.
18Jb 5:23 For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
18Jb 5:24 You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
18Jb 5:25 You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth.
18Jb 5:26 You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season.
18Jb 5:27 Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."
18Jb 6:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 6:2 "Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!
18Jb 6:3 For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
18Jb 6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
18Jb 6:5 Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?
18Jb 6:6 Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?
18Jb 6:7 My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.
18Jb 6:8 "Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,
18Jb 6:9 that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
18Jb 6:10 This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18Jb 6:11 What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?
18Jb 6:12 Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
18Jb 6:13 Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?
18Jb 6:14 "He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
18Jb 6:15 My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,
18Jb 6:16 which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.
18Jb 6:17 When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
18Jb 6:18 The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.
18Jb 6:19 The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.
18Jb 6:20 They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed.
18Jb 6:21 For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.
18Jb 6:22 Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?
18Jb 6:23 Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?
18Jb 6:24 "Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.
18Jb 6:25 How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?
18Jb 6:26 Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?
18Jb 6:27 You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.
18Jb 6:28 "But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face.
18Jb 6:29 Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.
18Jb 6:30 Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?
18Jb 7:1 "Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?
18Jb 7:2 Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,
18Jb 7:3 so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
18Jb 7:4 When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn.
18Jb 7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.
18Jb 7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.
18Jb 7:7 "Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good.
18Jb 7:8 The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone.
18Jb 7:9 As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;
18Jb 7:10 he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore.
18Jb 7:11 "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 7:12 Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?
18Jb 7:13 When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'
18Jb 7:14 then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18Jb 7:15 so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.
18Jb 7:16 I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.
18Jb 7:17 What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,
18Jb 7:18 visit him every morning and test him every moment?
18Jb 7:19 How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?
18Jb 7:20 If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?
18Jb 7:21 Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."
18Jb 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
18Jb 8:2 "How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
18Jb 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
18Jb 8:4 If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.
18Jb 8:5 If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,
18Jb 8:6 if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.
18Jb 8:7 And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.
18Jb 8:8 "For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out.
18Jb 8:9 For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow.
18Jb 8:10 Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?
18Jb 8:11 "Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?
18Jb 8:12 While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.
18Jb 8:13 Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.
18Jb 8:14 His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web.
18Jb 8:15 He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.
18Jb 8:16 He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden.
18Jb 8:17 His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.
18Jb 8:18 If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'
18Jb 8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring.
18Jb 8:20 "Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers.
18Jb 8:21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting.
18Jb 8:22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."
18Jb 9:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 9:2 "Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God?
18Jb 9:3 If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times.
18Jb 9:4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength--who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?--
18Jb 9:5 he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger,
18Jb 9:6 who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
18Jb 9:7 who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;
18Jb 9:8 who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea;
18Jb 9:9 who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
18Jb 9:10 who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number.
18Jb 9:11 Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
18Jb 9:12 Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'
18Jb 9:13 "God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab.
18Jb 9:14 How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?
18Jb 9:15 Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
18Jb 9:16 If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.
18Jb 9:17 For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause;
18Jb 9:18 he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
18Jb 9:19 If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
18Jb 9:20 Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
18Jb 9:21 I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life.
18Jb 9:22 It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
18Jb 9:23 When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.
18Jb 9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges-- if it is not he, who then is it?
18Jb 9:25 "My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good.
18Jb 9:26 They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey.
18Jb 9:27 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,'
18Jb 9:28 I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
18Jb 9:29 I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
18Jb 9:30 If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,
18Jb 9:31 yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me.
18Jb 9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together.
18Jb 9:33 There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.
18Jb 9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me.
18Jb 9:35 Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself.
18Jb 10:1 "I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 10:2 I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me.
18Jb 10:3 Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked?
18Jb 10:4 Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees?
18Jb 10:5 Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years,
18Jb 10:6 that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,
18Jb 10:7 although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand?
18Jb 10:8 Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether.
18Jb 10:9 Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?
18Jb 10:10 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
18Jb 10:11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
18Jb 10:12 You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.
18Jb 10:13 Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.
18Jb 10:14 If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity.
18Jb 10:15 If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction.
18Jb 10:16 And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me.
18Jb 10:17 You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.
18Jb 10:18 "Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me
18Jb 10:19 and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.
18Jb 10:20 Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer
18Jb 10:21 before I go--and I shall not return-- to the land of darkness and deep shadow,
18Jb 10:22 the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness."
18Jb 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
18Jb 11:2 "Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?
18Jb 11:3 Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
18Jb 11:4 For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.'
18Jb 11:5 But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you,
18Jb 11:6 and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
18Jb 11:7 "Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
18Jb 11:8 It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know?
18Jb 11:9 Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
18Jb 11:10 If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back?
18Jb 11:11 For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
18Jb 11:12 But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man!
18Jb 11:13 "If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him.
18Jb 11:14 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents.
18Jb 11:15 Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear.
18Jb 11:16 You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
18Jb 11:17 And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
18Jb 11:18 And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security.
18Jb 11:19 You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor.
18Jb 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
18Jb 12:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 12:2 "No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you.
18Jb 12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?
18Jb 12:4 I am a laughingstock to my friends; I, who called to God and he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock.
18Jb 12:5 In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip.
18Jb 12:6 The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hand.
18Jb 12:7 "But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you;
18Jb 12:8 or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you.
18Jb 12:9 Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18Jb 12:10 In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind.
18Jb 12:11 Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
18Jb 12:12 Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding in length of days.
18Jb 12:13 "With God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding.
18Jb 12:14 If he tears down, none can rebuild; if he shuts a man in, none can open.
18Jb 12:15 If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land.
18Jb 12:16 With him are strength and sound wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his.
18Jb 12:17 He leads counselors away stripped, and judges he makes fools.
18Jb 12:18 He looses the bonds of kings and binds a waistcloth on their hips.
18Jb 12:19 He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty.
18Jb 12:20 He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment of the elders.
18Jb 12:21 He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong.
18Jb 12:22 He uncovers the deeps out of darkness and brings deep darkness to light.
18Jb 12:23 He makes nations great, and he destroys them; he enlarges nations, and leads them away.
18Jb 12:24 He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
18Jb 12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunken man.
18Jb 13:1 "Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
18Jb 13:2 What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18Jb 13:3 But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God.
18Jb 13:4 As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all.
18Jb 13:5 Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom!
18Jb 13:6 Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
18Jb 13:7 Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him?
18Jb 13:8 Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God?
18Jb 13:9 Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man?
18Jb 13:10 He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality.
18Jb 13:11 Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you?
18Jb 13:12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
18Jb 13:13 "Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may.
18Jb 13:14 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand?
18Jb 13:15 Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face.
18Jb 13:16 This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him.
18Jb 13:17 Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears.
18Jb 13:18 Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right.
18Jb 13:19 Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
18Jb 13:20 Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face:
18Jb 13:21 withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me.
18Jb 13:22 Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me.
18Jb 13:23 How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
18Jb 13:24 Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff?
18Jb 13:26 For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet.
18Jb 13:28 Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
18Jb 14:1 "Man who is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble.
18Jb 14:2 He comes out like a flower and withers; he flees like a shadow and continues not.
18Jb 14:3 And do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you?
18Jb 14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? There is not one.
18Jb 14:5 Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass,
18Jb 14:6 look away from him and leave him alone, that he may enjoy, like a hired hand, his day.
18Jb 14:7 "For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.
18Jb 14:8 Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the soil,
18Jb 14:9 yet at the scent of water it will bud and put out branches like a young plant.
18Jb 14:10 But a man dies and is laid low; man breathes his last, and where is he?
18Jb 14:11 As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up,
18Jb 14:12 so a man lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake or be roused out of his sleep.
18Jb 14:13 Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!
18Jb 14:14 If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal should come.
18Jb 14:15 You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands.
18Jb 14:16 For then you would number my steps; you would not keep watch over my sin;
18Jb 14:17 my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity.
18Jb 14:18 "But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place;
18Jb 14:19 the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of man.
18Jb 14:20 You prevail forever against him, and he passes; you change his countenance, and send him away.
18Jb 14:21 His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he perceives it not.
18Jb 14:22 He feels only the pain of his own body, and he mourns only for himself."
18Jb 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
18Jb 15:2 "Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
18Jb 15:3 Should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good?
18Jb 15:4 But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God.
18Jb 15:5 For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
18Jb 15:6 Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you.
18Jb 15:7 "Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?
18Jb 15:8 Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
18Jb 15:9 What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
18Jb 15:10 Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older than your father.
18Jb 15:11 Are the comforts of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?
18Jb 15:12 Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18Jb 15:13 that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth?
18Jb 15:14 What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
18Jb 15:15 Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight;
18Jb 15:16 how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water!
18Jb 15:17 "I will show you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare
18Jb 15:18 (what wise men have told, without hiding it from their fathers,
18Jb 15:19 to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them).
18Jb 15:20 The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.
18Jb 15:21 Dreadful sounds are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.
18Jb 15:22 He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, and he is marked for the sword.
18Jb 15:23 He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand;
18Jb 15:24 distress and anguish terrify him; they prevail against him, like a king ready for battle.
18Jb 15:25 Because he has stretched out his hand against God and defies the Almighty,
18Jb 15:26 running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield;
18Jb 15:27 because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist
18Jb 15:28 and has lived in desolate cities, in houses that none should inhabit, which were ready to become heaps of ruins;
18Jb 15:29 he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the earth;
18Jb 15:30 he will not depart from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and by the breath of his mouth he will depart.
18Jb 15:31 Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his payment.
18Jb 15:32 It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not be green.
18Jb 15:33 He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive tree.
18Jb 15:34 For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery.
18Jb 15:35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil, and their womb prepares deceit."
18Jb 16:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 16:2 "I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.
18Jb 16:3 Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
18Jb 16:4 I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you.
18Jb 16:5 I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.
18Jb 16:6 "If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?
18Jb 16:7 Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.
18Jb 16:8 And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face.
18Jb 16:9 He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
18Jb 16:10 Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me.
18Jb 16:11 God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
18Jb 16:12 I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;
18Jb 16:13 his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.
18Jb 16:14 He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior.
18Jb 16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust.
18Jb 16:16 My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness,
18Jb 16:17 although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
18Jb 16:18 "O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place.
18Jb 16:19 Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high.
18Jb 16:20 My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,
18Jb 16:21 that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor.
18Jb 16:22 For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
18Jb 17:1 "My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me.
18Jb 17:2 Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation.
18Jb 17:3 "Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there who will put up security for me?
18Jb 17:4 Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph.
18Jb 17:5 He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property-- the eyes of his children will fail.
18Jb 17:6 "He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit.
18Jb 17:7 My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow.
18Jb 17:8 The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless.
18Jb 17:9 Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.
18Jb 17:10 But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you.
18Jb 17:11 My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart.
18Jb 17:12 They make night into day: 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.'
18Jb 17:13 If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness,
18Jb 17:14 if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'
18Jb 17:15 where then is my hope? Who will see my hope?
18Jb 17:16 Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"
18Jb 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
18Jb 18:2 "How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak.
18Jb 18:3 Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?
18Jb 18:4 You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place?
18Jb 18:5 "Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine.
18Jb 18:6 The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out.
18Jb 18:7 His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down.
18Jb 18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh.
18Jb 18:9 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him.
18Jb 18:10 A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path.
18Jb 18:11 Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels.
18Jb 18:12 His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling.
18Jb 18:13 It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.
18Jb 18:14 He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors.
18Jb 18:15 In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation.
18Jb 18:16 His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above.
18Jb 18:17 His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street.
18Jb 18:18 He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world.
18Jb 18:19 He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live.
18Jb 18:20 They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east.
18Jb 18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God."
18Jb 19:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 19:2 "How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words?
18Jb 19:3 These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?
18Jb 19:4 And even if it be true that I have erred, my error remains with myself.
18Jb 19:5 If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me,
18Jb 19:6 know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me.
18Jb 19:7 Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice.
18Jb 19:8 He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths.
18Jb 19:9 He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head.
18Jb 19:10 He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, and my hope has he pulled up like a tree.
18Jb 19:11 He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary.
18Jb 19:12 His troops come on together; they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
18Jb 19:13 "He has put my brothers far from me, and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me.
18Jb 19:14 My relatives have failed me, my close friends have forgotten me.
18Jb 19:15 The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes.
18Jb 19:16 I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy.
18Jb 19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, and I am a stench to the children of my own mother.
18Jb 19:18 Even young children despise me; when I rise they talk against me.
18Jb 19:19 All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me.
18Jb 19:20 My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
18Jb 19:21 Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!
18Jb 19:22 Why do you, like God, pursue me? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh?
18Jb 19:23 "Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
18Jb 19:24 Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!
18Jb 19:25 For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth.
18Jb 19:26 And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God,
18Jb 19:27 whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!
18Jb 19:28 If you say, 'How we will pursue him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him,'
18Jb 19:29 be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
18Jb 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
18Jb 20:2 "Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me.
18Jb 20:3 I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me.
18Jb 20:4 Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth,
18Jb 20:5 that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?
18Jb 20:6 Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,
18Jb 20:7 he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'
18Jb 20:8 He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
18Jb 20:9 The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him.
18Jb 20:10 His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth.
18Jb 20:11 His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust.
18Jb 20:12 "Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,
18Jb 20:13 though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth,
18Jb 20:14 yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him.
18Jb 20:15 He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.
18Jb 20:16 He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him.
18Jb 20:17 He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.
18Jb 20:18 He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment.
18Jb 20:19 For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build.
18Jb 20:20 "Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him.
18Jb 20:21 There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure.
18Jb 20:22 In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him.
18Jb 20:23 To fill his belly to the full, God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body.
18Jb 20:24 He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through.
18Jb 20:25 It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him.
18Jb 20:26 Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed.
18Jb 20:27 The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.
18Jb 20:28 The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath.
18Jb 20:29 This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God."
18Jb 21:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 21:2 "Keep listening to my words, and let this be your comfort.
18Jb 21:3 Bear with me, and I will speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.
18Jb 21:4 As for me, is my complaint against man? Why should I not be impatient?
18Jb 21:5 Look at me and be appalled, and lay your hand over your mouth.
18Jb 21:6 When I remember, I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh.
18Jb 21:7 Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?
18Jb 21:8 Their offspring are established in their presence, and their descendants before their eyes.
18Jb 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them.
18Jb 21:10 Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry.
18Jb 21:11 They send out their little boys like a flock, and their children dance.
18Jb 21:12 They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
18Jb 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol.
18Jb 21:14 They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways.
18Jb 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?'
18Jb 21:16 Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand? The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18Jb 21:17 "How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains in his anger?
18Jb 21:18 That they are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away?
18Jb 21:19 You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let him pay it out to them, that they may know it.
18Jb 21:20 Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
18Jb 21:21 For what do they care for their houses after them, when the number of their months is cut off?
18Jb 21:22 Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those who are on high?
18Jb 21:23 One dies in his full vigor, being wholly at ease and secure,
18Jb 21:24 his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist.
18Jb 21:25 Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of prosperity.
18Jb 21:26 They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them.
18Jb 21:27 "Behold, I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me.
18Jb 21:28 For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'
18Jb 21:29 Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony
18Jb 21:30 that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity, that he is rescued in the day of wrath?
18Jb 21:31 Who declares his way to his face, and who repays him for what he has done?
18Jb 21:32 When he is carried to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb.
18Jb 21:33 The clods of the valley are sweet to him; all mankind follows after him, and those who go before him are innumerable.
18Jb 21:34 How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood."
18Jb 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
18Jb 22:2 "Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
18Jb 22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?
18Jb 22:4 Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you?
18Jb 22:5 Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities.
18Jb 22:6 For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing.
18Jb 22:7 You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
18Jb 22:8 The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it.
18Jb 22:9 You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed.
18Jb 22:10 Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,
18Jb 22:11 or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.
18Jb 22:12 "Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!
18Jb 22:13 But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?
18Jb 22:14 Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.'
18Jb 22:15 Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod?
18Jb 22:16 They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away.
18Jb 22:17 They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'
18Jb 22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18Jb 22:19 The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them,
18Jb 22:20 saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.'
18Jb 22:21 "Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you.
18Jb 22:22 Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.
18Jb 22:23 If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,
18Jb 22:24 if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed,
18Jb 22:25 then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.
18Jb 22:26 For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
18Jb 22:27 You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.
18Jb 22:28 You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.
18Jb 22:29 For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly.
18Jb 22:30 He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
18Jb 23:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 23:2 "Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.
18Jb 23:3 Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!
18Jb 23:4 I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18Jb 23:5 I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.
18Jb 23:6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me.
18Jb 23:7 There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.
18Jb 23:8 "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him;
18Jb 23:9 on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.
18Jb 23:10 But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold.
18Jb 23:11 My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
18Jb 23:12 I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.
18Jb 23:13 But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does.
18Jb 23:14 For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind.
18Jb 23:15 Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.
18Jb 23:16 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
18Jb 23:17 yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.
18Jb 24:1 "Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days?
18Jb 24:2 Some move landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them.
18Jb 24:3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
18Jb 24:4 They thrust the poor off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
18Jb 24:5 Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil, seeking game; the wasteland yields food for their children.
18Jb 24:6 They gather their fodder in the field, and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man.
18Jb 24:7 They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.
18Jb 24:8 They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter.
18Jb 24:9 (There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast, and they take a pledge against the poor.)
18Jb 24:10 They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves;
18Jb 24:11 among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst.
18Jb 24:12 From out of the city the dying groan, and the soul of the wounded cries for help; yet God charges no one with wrong.
18Jb 24:13 "There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths.
18Jb 24:14 The murderer rises before it is light, that he may kill the poor and needy, and in the night he is like a thief.
18Jb 24:15 The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he veils his face.
18Jb 24:16 In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light.
18Jb 24:17 For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
18Jb 24:18 "You say, 'Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the land; no treader turns toward their vineyards.
18Jb 24:19 Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
18Jb 24:20 The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered, so wickedness is broken like a tree.'
18Jb 24:21 "They wrong the barren, childless woman, and do no good to the widow.
18Jb 24:22 Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life.
18Jb 24:23 He gives them security, and they are supported, and his eyes are upon their ways.
18Jb 24:24 They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like the heads of grain.
18Jb 24:25 If it is not so, who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say?"
18Jb 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
18Jb 25:2 "Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven.
18Jb 25:3 Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
18Jb 25:4 How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure?
18Jb 25:5 Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes;
18Jb 25:6 how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"
18Jb 26:1 Then Job answered and said:
18Jb 26:2 "How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!
18Jb 26:3 How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
18Jb 26:4 With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you?
18Jb 26:5 The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants.
18Jb 26:6 Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
18Jb 26:7 He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.
18Jb 26:8 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them.
18Jb 26:9 He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud.
18Jb 26:10 He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
18Jb 26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.
18Jb 26:12 By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.
18Jb 26:13 By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
18Jb 26:14 Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18Jb 27:1 And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
18Jb 27:2 "As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
18Jb 27:3 as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
18Jb 27:4 my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
18Jb 27:5 Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
18Jb 27:6 I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
18Jb 27:7 "Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
18Jb 27:8 For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life?
18Jb 27:9 Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
18Jb 27:10 Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
18Jb 27:11 I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
18Jb 27:12 Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?
18Jb 27:13 "This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:
18Jb 27:14 If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread.
18Jb 27:15 Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep.
18Jb 27:16 Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay,
18Jb 27:17 he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.
18Jb 27:18 He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes.
18Jb 27:19 He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone.
18Jb 27:20 Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off.
18Jb 27:21 The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
18Jb 27:22 It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight.
18Jb 27:23 It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place.
18Jb 28:1 "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine.
18Jb 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore.
18Jb 28:3 Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
18Jb 28:4 He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro.
18Jb 28:5 As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire.
18Jb 28:6 Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.
18Jb 28:7 "That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
18Jb 28:8 The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.
18Jb 28:9 "Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots.
18Jb 28:10 He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.
18Jb 28:11 He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light.
18Jb 28:12 "But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
18Jb 28:13 Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.
18Jb 28:14 The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
18Jb 28:15 It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price.
18Jb 28:16 It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
18Jb 28:17 Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
18Jb 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.
18Jb 28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
18Jb 28:20 "From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?
18Jb 28:21 It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.
18Jb 28:22 Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'
18Jb 28:23 "God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.
18Jb 28:24 For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18Jb 28:25 When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,
18Jb 28:26 when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,
18Jb 28:27 then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.
18Jb 28:28 And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"
18Jb 29:1 And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
18Jb 29:2 "Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,
18Jb 29:3 when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,
18Jb 29:4 as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent,
18Jb 29:5 when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me,
18Jb 29:6 when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
18Jb 29:7 When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,
18Jb 29:8 the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;
18Jb 29:9 the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;
18Jb 29:10 the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
18Jb 29:11 When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,
18Jb 29:12 because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him.
18Jb 29:13 The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
18Jb 29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
18Jb 29:15 I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
18Jb 29:16 I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.
18Jb 29:17 I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
18Jb 29:18 Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,
18Jb 29:19 my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,
18Jb 29:20 my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'
18Jb 29:21 "Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.
18Jb 29:22 After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them.
18Jb 29:23 They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
18Jb 29:24 I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down.
18Jb 29:25 I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.
18Jb 30:1 "But now they laugh at me, men who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
18Jb 30:2 What could I gain from the strength of their hands, men whose vigor is gone?
18Jb 30:3 Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation;
18Jb 30:4 they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes, and the roots of the broom tree for their food.
18Jb 30:5 They are driven out from human company; they shout after them as after a thief.
18Jb 30:6 In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
18Jb 30:7 Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together.
18Jb 30:8 A senseless, a nameless brood, they have been whipped out of the land.
18Jb 30:9 "And now I have become their song; I am a byword to them.
18Jb 30:10 They abhor me; they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me.
18Jb 30:11 Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
18Jb 30:12 On my right hand the rabble rise; they push away my feet; they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
18Jb 30:13 They break up my path; they promote my calamity; they need no one to help them.
18Jb 30:14 As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on.
18Jb 30:15 Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
18Jb 30:16 "And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold of me.
18Jb 30:17 The night racks my bones, and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest.
18Jb 30:18 With great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my tunic.
18Jb 30:19 God has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
18Jb 30:20 I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me.
18Jb 30:21 You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me.
18Jb 30:22 You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm.
18Jb 30:23 For I know that you will bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living.
18Jb 30:24 "Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, and in his disaster cry for help?
18Jb 30:25 Did not I weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
18Jb 30:26 But when I hoped for good, evil came, and when I waited for light, darkness came.
18Jb 30:27 My inward parts are in turmoil and never still; days of affliction come to meet me.
18Jb 30:28 I go about darkened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
18Jb 30:29 I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches.
18Jb 30:30 My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat.
18Jb 30:31 My lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe to the voice of those who weep.
18Jb 31:1 "I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?
18Jb 31:2 What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high?
18Jb 31:3 Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity?
18Jb 31:4 Does not he see my ways and number all my steps?
18Jb 31:5 "If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit;
18Jb 31:6 (Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!)
18Jb 31:7 if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands,
18Jb 31:8 then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out.
18Jb 31:9 "If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,
18Jb 31:10 then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her.
18Jb 31:11 For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
18Jb 31:12 for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase.
18Jb 31:13 "If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me,
18Jb 31:14 what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?
18Jb 31:15 Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
18Jb 31:16 "If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
18Jb 31:17 or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it
18Jb 31:18 (for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow),
18Jb 31:19 if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering,
18Jb 31:20 if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
18Jb 31:21 if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,
18Jb 31:22 then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket.
18Jb 31:23 For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty.
18Jb 31:24 "If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence,
18Jb 31:25 if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much,
18Jb 31:26 if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,
18Jb 31:27 and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand,
18Jb 31:28 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above.
18Jb 31:29 "If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook him
18Jb 31:30 (I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse),
18Jb 31:31 if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?'
18Jb 31:32 (the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler),
18Jb 31:33 if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
18Jb 31:34 because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors--
18Jb 31:35 Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!
18Jb 31:36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown;
18Jb 31:37 I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him.
18Jb 31:38 "If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together,
18Jb 31:39 if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last,
18Jb 31:40 let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
18Jb 32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18Jb 32:2 Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God.
18Jb 32:3 He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
18Jb 32:4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
18Jb 32:5 And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.
18Jb 32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
18Jb 32:7 I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'
18Jb 32:8 But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
18Jb 32:9 It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right.
18Jb 32:10 Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
18Jb 32:11 "Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
18Jb 32:12 I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words.
18Jb 32:13 Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.'
18Jb 32:14 He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.
18Jb 32:15 "They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say.
18Jb 32:16 And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
18Jb 32:17 I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.
18Jb 32:18 For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
18Jb 32:19 Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst.
18Jb 32:20 I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
18Jb 32:21 I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person.
18Jb 32:22 For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.
18Jb 33:1 "But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.
18Jb 33:2 Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.
18Jb 33:3 My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.
18Jb 33:4 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18Jb 33:5 Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.
18Jb 33:6 Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay.
18Jb 33:7 Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you.
18Jb 33:8 "Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words.
18Jb 33:9 You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me.
18Jb 33:10 Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy,
18Jb 33:11 he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'
18Jb 33:12 "Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
18Jb 33:13 Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?
18Jb 33:14 For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it.
18Jb 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,
18Jb 33:16 then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,
18Jb 33:17 that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;
18Jb 33:18 he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.
18Jb 33:19 "Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones,
18Jb 33:20 so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food.
18Jb 33:21 His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.
18Jb 33:22 His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death.
18Jb 33:23 If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him,
18Jb 33:24 and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom;
18Jb 33:25 let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor';
18Jb 33:26 then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.
18Jb 33:27 He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me.
18Jb 33:28 He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'
18Jb 33:29 "Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,
18Jb 33:30 to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life.
18Jb 33:31 Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
18Jb 33:32 If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.
18Jb 33:33 If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
18Jb 34:1 Then Elihu answered and said:
18Jb 34:2 "Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;
18Jb 34:3 for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
18Jb 34:4 Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.
18Jb 34:5 For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right;
18Jb 34:6 in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
18Jb 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,
18Jb 34:8 who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men?
18Jb 34:9 For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.'
18Jb 34:10 "Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
18Jb 34:11 For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him.
18Jb 34:12 Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
18Jb 34:13 Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world?
18Jb 34:14 If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath,
18Jb 34:15 all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.
18Jb 34:16 "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
18Jb 34:17 Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
18Jb 34:18 who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,'
18Jb 34:19 who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
18Jb 34:20 In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
18Jb 34:21 "For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
18Jb 34:22 There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
18Jb 34:23 For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.
18Jb 34:24 He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place.
18Jb 34:25 Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
18Jb 34:26 He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see,
18Jb 34:27 because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways,
18Jb 34:28 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted--
18Jb 34:29 When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?--
18Jb 34:30 that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people.
18Jb 34:31 "For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more;
18Jb 34:32 teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
18Jb 34:33 Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know.
18Jb 34:34 Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say:
18Jb 34:35 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.'
18Jb 34:36 Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men.
18Jb 34:37 For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
18Jb 35:1 And Elihu answered and said:
18Jb 35:2 "Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,'
18Jb 35:3 that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'
18Jb 35:4 I will answer you and your friends with you.
18Jb 35:5 Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you.
18Jb 35:6 If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
18Jb 35:7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand?
18Jb 35:8 Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.
18Jb 35:9 "Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
18Jb 35:10 But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
18Jb 35:11 who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'
18Jb 35:12 There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
18Jb 35:13 Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.
18Jb 35:14 How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
18Jb 35:15 And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression,
18Jb 35:16 Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."
18Jb 36:1 And Elihu continued, and said:
18Jb 36:2 "Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.
18Jb 36:3 I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
18Jb 36:4 For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
18Jb 36:5 "Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.
18Jb 36:6 He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.
18Jb 36:7 He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
18Jb 36:8 And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction,
18Jb 36:9 then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
18Jb 36:10 He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity.
18Jb 36:11 If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.
18Jb 36:12 But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
18Jb 36:13 "The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them.
18Jb 36:14 They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes.
18Jb 36:15 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity.
18Jb 36:16 He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness.
18Jb 36:17 "But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you.
18Jb 36:18 Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
18Jb 36:19 Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength?
18Jb 36:20 Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place.
18Jb 36:21 Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction.
18Jb 36:22 Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?
18Jb 36:23 Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?
18Jb 36:24 "Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung.
18Jb 36:25 All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar.
18Jb 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable.
18Jb 36:27 For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain,
18Jb 36:28 which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly.
18Jb 36:29 Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?
18Jb 36:30 Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea.
18Jb 36:31 For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance.
18Jb 36:32 He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.
18Jb 36:33 Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises.
18Jb 37:1 "At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place.
18Jb 37:2 Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
18Jb 37:3 Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth.
18Jb 37:4 After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard.
18Jb 37:5 God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend.
18Jb 37:6 For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour.
18Jb 37:7 He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it.
18Jb 37:8 Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens.
18Jb 37:9 From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds.
18Jb 37:10 By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast.
18Jb 37:11 He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning.
18Jb 37:12 They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world.
18Jb 37:13 Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen.
18Jb 37:14 "Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God.
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
18Jb 37:16 Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,
18Jb 37:17 you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?
18Jb 37:18 Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror?
18Jb 37:19 Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.
18Jb 37:20 Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up?
18Jb 37:21 "And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them.
18Jb 37:22 Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty.
18Jb 37:23 The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate.
18Jb 37:24 Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."
18Jb 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
18Jb 38:2 "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
18Jb 38:3 Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me.
18Jb 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.
18Jb 38:5 Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
18Jb 38:6 On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,
18Jb 38:7 when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
18Jb 38:8 "Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb,
18Jb 38:9 when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,
18Jb 38:10 and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,
18Jb 38:11 and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'?
18Jb 38:12 "Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
18Jb 38:13 that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
18Jb 38:14 It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment.
18Jb 38:15 From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.
18Jb 38:16 "Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18Jb 38:17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
18Jb 38:18 Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.
18Jb 38:19 "Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,
18Jb 38:20 that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?
18Jb 38:21 You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
18Jb 38:22 "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
18Jb 38:23 which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
18Jb 38:24 What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?
18Jb 38:25 "Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt,
18Jb 38:26 to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,
18Jb 38:27 to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass?
18Jb 38:28 "Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?
18Jb 38:29 From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?
18Jb 38:30 The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
18Jb 38:31 "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?
18Jb 38:32 Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?
18Jb 38:34 "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that a flood of waters may cover you?
18Jb 38:35 Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?
18Jb 38:36 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?
18Jb 38:37 Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,
18Jb 38:38 when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together?
18Jb 38:39 "Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
18Jb 38:40 when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket?
18Jb 38:41 Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and wander about for lack of food?
18Jb 39:1 "Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does?
18Jb 39:2 Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,
18Jb 39:3 when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young?
18Jb 39:4 Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them.
18Jb 39:5 "Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
18Jb 39:6 to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place?
18Jb 39:7 He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver.
18Jb 39:8 He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.
18Jb 39:9 "Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger?
18Jb 39:10 Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you?
18Jb 39:11 Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor?
18Jb 39:12 Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
18Jb 39:13 "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love?
18Jb 39:14 For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground,
18Jb 39:15 forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them.
18Jb 39:16 She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear,
18Jb 39:17 because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding.
18Jb 39:18 When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider.
18Jb 39:19 "Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?
18Jb 39:20 Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying.
18Jb 39:21 He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons.
18Jb 39:22 He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword.
18Jb 39:23 Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin.
18Jb 39:24 With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
18Jb 39:25 When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
18Jb 39:26 "Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south?
18Jb 39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high?
18Jb 39:28 On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold.
18Jb 39:29 From there he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it from far away.
18Jb 39:30 His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he."
18Jb 40:1 And the LORD said to Job:
18Jb 40:2 "Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it."
18Jb 40:3 Then Job answered the LORD and said:
18Jb 40:4 "Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.
18Jb 40:5 I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further."
18Jb 40:6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
18Jb 40:7 "Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me.
18Jb 40:8 Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right?
18Jb 40:9 Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?
18Jb 40:10 "Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor.
18Jb 40:11 Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him.
18Jb 40:12 Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand.
18Jb 40:13 Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below.
18Jb 40:14 Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you.
18Jb 40:15 "Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox.
18Jb 40:16 Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly.
18Jb 40:17 He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
18Jb 40:18 His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron.
18Jb 40:19 "He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword!
18Jb 40:20 For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play.
18Jb 40:21 Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh.
18Jb 40:22 For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him.
18Jb 40:23 Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth.
18Jb 40:24 Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?
18Jb 41:1  "Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord?
18Jb 41:2 Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
18Jb 41:3 Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak to you soft words?
18Jb 41:4 Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?
18Jb 41:5 Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on a leash for your girls?
18Jb 41:6 Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
18Jb 41:7 Can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
18Jb 41:8 Lay your hands on him; remember the battle--you will not do it again!
18Jb 41:9  Behold, the hope of a man is false; he is laid low even at the sight of him.
18Jb 41:10 No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?
18Jb 41:11 Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
18Jb 41:12 "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame.
18Jb 41:13 Who can strip off his outer garment? Who would come near him with a bridle?
18Jb 41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.
18Jb 41:15 His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal.
18Jb 41:16 One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
18Jb 41:17 They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
18Jb 41:18 His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
18Jb 41:19 Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth.
18Jb 41:20 Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
18Jb 41:21 His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth.
18Jb 41:22 In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.
18Jb 41:23 The folds of his flesh stick together, firmly cast on him and immovable.
18Jb 41:24 His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone.
18Jb 41:25 When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.
18Jb 41:26 Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
18Jb 41:27 He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
18Jb 41:28 The arrow cannot make him flee; for him sling stones are turned to stubble.
18Jb 41:29 Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins.
18Jb 41:30 His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
18Jb 41:31 He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
18Jb 41:32 Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired.
18Jb 41:33 On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear.
18Jb 41:34 He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride."
18Jb 42:1 Then Job answered the LORD and said:
18Jb 42:2 "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
18Jb 42:3 'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
18Jb 42:4 'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you make it known to me.'
18Jb 42:5 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;
18Jb 42:6 therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
18Jb 42:7 After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
18Jb 42:8 Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
18Jb 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
18Jb 42:10 And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
18Jb 42:11 Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold.
18Jb 42:12 And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
18Jb 42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 42:14 And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.
18Jb 42:15 And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
18Jb 42:16 And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.
18Jb 42:17 And Job died, an old man, and full of days.

19Ps 1:1 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
19Ps 1:2 but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.
19Ps 1:3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.
19Ps 1:4 The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
19Ps 1:5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
19Ps 1:6 for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
19Ps 2:1 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
19Ps 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying,
19Ps 2:3 "Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us."
19Ps 2:4 He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.
19Ps 2:5 Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
19Ps 2:6 "As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."
19Ps 2:7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
19Ps 2:8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
19Ps 2:9 You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
19Ps 2:10 Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
19Ps 2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
19Ps 2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
19Ps 3:1 [A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.] O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
19Ps 3:2 many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah
19Ps 3:3 But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
19Ps 3:4 I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah

19Ps 4:4 Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah
19Ps 4:5 Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.
19Ps 4:6 There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!"
19Ps 4:7 You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.
19Ps 4:8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
19Ps 5:1 [To the choirmaster: for the flutes. A Psalm of David.] Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.
19Ps 5:2 Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray.
19Ps 5:3 O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.
19Ps 5:4 For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.
19Ps 5:5 The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.
19Ps 5:6 You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
19Ps 5:7 But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you.
19Ps 5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
19Ps 5:9 For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
19Ps 5:10 Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
19Ps 5:11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.
19Ps 5:12 For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover him with favor as with a shield.
19Ps 6:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments; according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.] O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.
19Ps 6:2 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled.
19Ps 6:3 My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O LORD--how long?
19Ps 6:4 Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
19Ps 6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?
19Ps 6:6 I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.
19Ps 6:7 My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.
19Ps 6:8 Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
19Ps 6:9 The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD accepts my prayer.
19Ps 6:10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
19Ps 7:1 [A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite.] O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,
19Ps 7:2 lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.
19Ps 7:3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
19Ps 7:4 if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,
19Ps 7:5 let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah
19Ps 7:6 Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.

19Ps 7:9 Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous-- you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!
19Ps 7:10 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
19Ps 7:11 God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day.
19Ps 7:12 If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;
19Ps 7:13 he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.
19Ps 7:14 Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.
19Ps 7:15 He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.
19Ps 7:16 His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.
19Ps 7:17 I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
19Ps 8:1 [To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David.] O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.
19Ps 8:2 Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.
19Ps 8:3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
19Ps 8:4 what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?
19Ps 8:5 Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.
19Ps 8:6 You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,
19Ps 8:7 all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,
19Ps 8:8 the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
19Ps 8:9 O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
19Ps 9:1 [ To the choirmaster: according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.] I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.
19Ps 9:2 I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
19Ps 9:3 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before your presence.
19Ps 9:4 For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.
19Ps 9:5 You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.
19Ps 9:6 The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities you rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.
19Ps 9:7 But the LORD sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice,
19Ps 9:8 and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness.
19Ps 9:9 The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
19Ps 9:10 And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.
19Ps 9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, who sits enthroned in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds!
19Ps 9:12 For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
19Ps 9:13 Be gracious to me, O LORD! See my affliction from those who hate me, O you who lift me up from the gates of death,
19Ps 9:14 that I may recount all your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in your salvation.
19Ps 9:15 The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.
19Ps 9:16 The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah
19Ps 9:17 The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
19Ps 9:18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.
19Ps 9:19 Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before you!
19Ps 9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah
19Ps 10:1 Why, O LORD, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
19Ps 10:2 In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.
19Ps 10:3 For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the LORD.
19Ps 10:4 In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, "There is no God."
19Ps 10:5 His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them.
19Ps 10:6 He says in his heart, "I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity."
19Ps 10:7 His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
19Ps 10:8 He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;
19Ps 10:9 he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.
19Ps 10:10 The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might.
19Ps 10:11 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it."
19Ps 10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted.
19Ps 10:13 Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, "You will not call to account"?
19Ps 10:14 But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless.
19Ps 10:15 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none.
19Ps 10:16 The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land.
19Ps 10:17 O LORD, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear
19Ps 10:18 to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.
19Ps 11:1 [To the choirmaster. Of David.] In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain,
19Ps 11:2 for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;
19Ps 11:3 if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"
19Ps 11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man.
19Ps 11:5 The LORD tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.
19Ps 11:6 Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
19Ps 11:7 For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
19Ps 12:1 [To the choirmaster: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.] Save, O LORD, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.
19Ps 12:2 Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
19Ps 12:3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
19Ps 12:4 those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?"
19Ps 12:5 "Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs."
19Ps 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.
19Ps 12:7 You, O LORD, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.
19Ps 12:8 On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.
19Ps 13:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
19Ps 13:2 How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
19Ps 13:3 Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
19Ps 13:4 lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
19Ps 13:5 But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
19Ps 13:6 I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
19Ps 14:1 [To the choirmaster. Of David.] The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good.
19Ps 14:2 The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
19Ps 14:3 They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
19Ps 14:4 Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD?
19Ps 14:5 There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.
19Ps 14:6 You would shame the plans of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.
19Ps 14:7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
19Ps 15:1 [A Psalm of David.] O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill?
19Ps 15:2 He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;
19Ps 15:3 who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
19Ps 15:4 in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
19Ps 15:5 who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
19Ps 16:1 [A Miktam of David.] Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
19Ps 16:2 I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you."
19Ps 16:3 As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
19Ps 16:4 The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.
19Ps 16:5 The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
19Ps 16:6 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
19Ps 16:7 I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
19Ps 16:8 I have set the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
19Ps 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.
19Ps 16:10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.
19Ps 16:11 You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
19Ps 17:1 [A Prayer of David.] Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!
19Ps 17:2 From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right!
19Ps 17:3 You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
19Ps 17:4 With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
19Ps 17:5 My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.
19Ps 17:6 I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words.
19Ps 17:7 Wondrously show your steadfast love, O Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.
19Ps 17:8 Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,
19Ps 17:9 from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies who surround me.
19Ps 17:10 They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
19Ps 17:11 They have now surrounded our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.
19Ps 17:12 He is like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush.
19Ps 17:13 Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him! Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,
19Ps 17:14 from men by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants.
19Ps 17:15 As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.
19Ps 18:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD rescued him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said:] I love you, O LORD, my strength.
19Ps 18:2 The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
19Ps 18:3 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
19Ps 18:4 The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;
19Ps 18:5 the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
19Ps 18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.
19Ps 18:7 Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
19Ps 18:8 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
19Ps 18:9 He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
19Ps 18:10 He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.
19Ps 18:11 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.
19Ps 18:12 Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.
19Ps 18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.
19Ps 18:14 And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.
19Ps 18:15 Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
19Ps 18:16 He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.
19Ps 18:17 He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
19Ps 18:18 They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.
19Ps 18:19 He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.
19Ps 18:20 The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.
19Ps 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
19Ps 18:22 For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
19Ps 18:23 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.
19Ps 18:24 So the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
19Ps 18:25 With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;
19Ps 18:26 with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.
19Ps 18:27 For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.
19Ps 18:28 For it is you who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.
19Ps 18:29 For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
19Ps 18:30 This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
19Ps 18:31 For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--
19Ps 18:32 the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.
19Ps 18:33 He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
19Ps 18:34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19Ps 18:35 You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.
19Ps 18:36 You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
19Ps 18:37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.
19Ps 18:38 I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
19Ps 18:39 For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
19Ps 18:40 You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
19Ps 18:41 They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
19Ps 18:42 I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.

19Ps 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.
19Ps 34:20 He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
19Ps 34:21 Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
19Ps 34:22 The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
19Ps 35:1 [Of David.] Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!
19Ps 35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler and rise for my help!
19Ps 35:3 Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, "I am your salvation!"
19Ps 35:4 Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and disappointed who devise evil against me!
19Ps 35:5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away!
19Ps 35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them!
19Ps 35:7 For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.
19Ps 35:8 Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it! And let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it--to his destruction!
19Ps 35:9 Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD, exulting in his salvation.
19Ps 35:10 All my bones shall say, "O LORD, who is like you, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him?"
19Ps 35:11 Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I do not know.
19Ps 35:12 They repay me evil for good; my soul is bereft.
19Ps 35:13 But I, when they were sick-- I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting; I prayed with head bowed on my chest.
19Ps 35:14 I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; as one who laments his mother, I bowed down in mourning.
19Ps 35:15 But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered; they gathered together against me; wretches whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing;
19Ps 35:16 like profane mockers at a feast, they gnash at me with their teeth.
19Ps 35:17 How long, O Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their destruction, my precious life from the lions!
19Ps 35:18 I will thank you in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise you.
19Ps 35:19 Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.
19Ps 35:20 For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they devise words of deceit.
19Ps 35:21 They open wide their mouths against me; they say, "Aha, Aha! Our eyes have seen it!"
19Ps 35:22 You have seen, O LORD; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!
19Ps 35:23 Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication, for my cause, my God and my Lord!
19Ps 35:24 Vindicate me, O LORD, my God, according to your righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me!
19Ps 35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha, our heart's desire!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."
19Ps 35:26 Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!
19Ps 35:27 Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad and say evermore, "Great is the LORD, who delights in the welfare of his servant!"
19Ps 35:28 Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness and of your praise all the day long.
19Ps 36:1 [To the choirmaster. Of David, the servant of the LORD.] Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.
19Ps 36:2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
19Ps 36:3 The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.
19Ps 36:4 He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil.
19Ps 36:5 Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
19Ps 36:6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O LORD.
19Ps 36:7 How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
19Ps 36:8 They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
19Ps 36:9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light.
19Ps 36:10 Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart!
19Ps 36:11 Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19Ps 36:12 There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
19Ps 37:1 [ Of David.] Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers!
19Ps 37:2 For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb.
19Ps 37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.
19Ps 37:4 Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
19Ps 37:5 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.
19Ps 37:6 He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday.
19Ps 37:7 Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!
19Ps 37:8 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
19Ps 37:9 For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land.
19Ps 37:10 In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.
19Ps 37:11 But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.
19Ps 37:12 The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him,
19Ps 37:13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.
19Ps 37:14 The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright;
19Ps 37:15 their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
19Ps 37:16 Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.
19Ps 37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
19Ps 37:18 The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever;
19Ps 37:19 they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance.
19Ps 37:20 But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish--like smoke they vanish away.
19Ps 37:21 The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;
19Ps 37:22 for those blessed by the LORD shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
19Ps 37:23 The steps of a man are established by the LORD, when he delights in his way;
19Ps 37:24 though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD upholds his hand.
19Ps 37:25 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.
19Ps 37:26 He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing.
19Ps 37:27 Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever.
19Ps 37:28 For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
19Ps 37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever.
19Ps 37:30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.
19Ps 37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.
19Ps 37:32 The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death.
19Ps 37:33 The LORD will not abandon him to his power or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.
19Ps 37:34 Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off.
19Ps 37:35 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree.
19Ps 37:36 But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.
19Ps 37:37 Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.
19Ps 37:38 But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.
19Ps 37:39 The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
19Ps 37:40 The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
19Ps 38:1 [A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering.] O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath!
19Ps 38:2 For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.
19Ps 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
19Ps 38:4 For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
19Ps 38:5 My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness,
19Ps 38:6 I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning.
19Ps 38:7 For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
19Ps 38:8 I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
19Ps 38:9 O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19Ps 38:10 My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes--it also has gone from me.
19Ps 38:11 My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off.
19Ps 38:12 Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.
19Ps 38:13 But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth.
19Ps 38:14 I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.
19Ps 38:15 But for you, O LORD, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.
19Ps 38:16 For I said, "Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!"
19Ps 38:17 For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me.
19Ps 38:18 I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.
19Ps 38:19 But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
19Ps 38:20 Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good.
19Ps 38:21 Do not forsake me, O LORD! O my God, be not far from me!
19Ps 38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
19Ps 39:1 [To the choirmaster: to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.] I said, "I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence."
19Ps 39:2 I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse.
19Ps 39:3 My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
19Ps 39:4 "O LORD, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!
19Ps 39:5 Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah
19Ps 39:6 Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather!
19Ps 39:7 "And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you.
19Ps 39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool!
19Ps 39:9 I am mute; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it.
19Ps 39:10 Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand.
19Ps 39:11 When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah
19Ps 39:12 "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers.
19Ps 39:13 Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!"
19Ps 40:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
19Ps 40:2 He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
19Ps 40:3 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.
19Ps 40:4 Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie!
19Ps 40:5 You have multiplied, O LORD my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
19Ps 40:6 In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
19Ps 40:7 Then I said, "Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me:
19Ps 40:8 I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."
19Ps 40:9 I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O LORD.
19Ps 40:10 I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
19Ps 40:11 As for you, O LORD, you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!
19Ps 40:12 For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
19Ps 40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!
19Ps 40:14 Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
19Ps 40:15 Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"
19Ps 40:16 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, "Great is the LORD!"
19Ps 40:17 As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!
19Ps 41:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him;
19Ps 41:2 the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.
19Ps 41:3 The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health.
19Ps 41:4 As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!"
19Ps 41:5 My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die, and his name perish?"
19Ps 41:6 And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
19Ps 41:7 All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
19Ps 41:8 They say, "A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies."
19Ps 41:9 Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
19Ps 41:10 But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them!
19Ps 41:11 By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.
19Ps 41:12 But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
19Ps 41:13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
19Ps 42:1 [To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.] As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.
19Ps 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
19Ps 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:4 These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.
19Ps 42:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation
19Ps 42:6 and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
19Ps 42:7 Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me.
19Ps 42:8 By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
19Ps 42:9 I say to God, my rock: "Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
19Ps 42:10 As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:11 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.
19Ps 43:1 Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people, from the deceitful and unjust man deliver me!
19Ps 43:2 For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you rejected me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
19Ps 43:3 Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling!
19Ps 43:4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.
19Ps 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.
19Ps 44:1 [To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.] O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old:
19Ps 44:2 you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
19Ps 44:3 for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them.
19Ps 44:4 You are my King, O God; ordain salvation for Jacob!
19Ps 44:5 Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us.
19Ps 44:6 For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
19Ps 44:7 But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us.
19Ps 44:8 In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah
19Ps 44:9 But you have rejected us and disgraced us and have not gone out with our armies.
19Ps 44:10 You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil.
19Ps 44:11 You have made us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations.
19Ps 44:12 You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.
19Ps 44:13 You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.
19Ps 44:14 You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
19Ps 44:15 All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
19Ps 44:16 at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
19Ps 44:17 All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant.
19Ps 44:18 Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way;
19Ps 44:19 yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.
19Ps 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19Ps 44:21 would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
19Ps 44:22 Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
19Ps 44:23 Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!
19Ps 44:24 Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
19Ps 44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground.
19Ps 44:26 Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love!
19Ps 45:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah; a love song.] My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
19Ps 45:2 You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.
19Ps 45:3 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty!
19Ps 45:4 In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!
19Ps 45:5 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.
19Ps 45:6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness;
19Ps 45:7 you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
19Ps 45:8 your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
19Ps 45:9 daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
19Ps 45:10 Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house,
19Ps 45:11 and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him.
19Ps 45:12 The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people.
19Ps 45:13 All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold.
19Ps 45:14 In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her.
19Ps 45:15 With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
19Ps 45:16 In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.
19Ps 45:17 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.
19Ps 46:1 [To the choirmaster. Of the Sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A Song.] God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
19Ps 46:2 Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
19Ps 46:3 though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah
19Ps 46:4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.
19Ps 46:5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.
19Ps 46:6 The nations rage, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts.
19Ps 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
19Ps 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, how he has brought desolations on the earth.
19Ps 46:9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots with fire.
19Ps 46:10 "Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!"
19Ps 46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
19Ps 47:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy!
19Ps 47:2 For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth.
19Ps 47:3 He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
19Ps 47:4 He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah
19Ps 47:5 God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
19Ps 47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!
19Ps 47:7 For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!
19Ps 47:8 God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.
19Ps 47:9 The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!
19Ps 48:1 [A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,
19Ps 48:2 beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.
19Ps 48:3 Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.
19Ps 48:4 For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.
19Ps 48:5 As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight.
19Ps 48:6 Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.
19Ps 48:7 By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.
19Ps 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah
19Ps 48:9 We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.
19Ps 48:10 As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
19Ps 48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!
19Ps 48:12 Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers,
19Ps 48:13 consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation
19Ps 48:14 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.
19Ps 49:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
19Ps 49:2 both low and high, rich and poor together!
19Ps 49:3 My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
19Ps 49:4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.
19Ps 49:5 Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,
19Ps 49:6 those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
19Ps 49:7 Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,
19Ps 49:8 for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,
19Ps 49:9 that he should live on forever and never see the pit.
19Ps 49:10 For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.
19Ps 49:11 Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names.
19Ps 49:12 Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.
19Ps 49:13 This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah
19Ps 49:14 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell.
19Ps 49:15 But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah
19Ps 49:16 Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.
19Ps 49:17 For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.
19Ps 49:18 For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed--and though you get praise when you do well for yourself--
19Ps 49:19 his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light.
19Ps 49:20 Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
19Ps 50:1 [A Psalm of Asaph.] The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
19Ps 50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
19Ps 50:3 Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest.
19Ps 50:4 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:
19Ps 50:5 "Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"
19Ps 50:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah
19Ps 50:7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
19Ps 50:8 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.
19Ps 50:9 I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds.
19Ps 50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
19Ps 50:11 I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine.
19Ps 50:12 "If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.
19Ps 50:13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19Ps 50:14 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High,
19Ps 50:15 and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."
19Ps 50:16 But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips?
19Ps 50:17 For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.
19Ps 50:18 If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.
19Ps 50:19 "You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
19Ps 50:20 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.
19Ps 50:21 These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.
19Ps 50:22 "Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver!
19Ps 50:23 The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!"
19Ps 51:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.] Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
19Ps 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!
19Ps 51:3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
19Ps 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.
19Ps 51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
19Ps 51:6 Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
19Ps 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
19Ps 51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
19Ps 51:9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
19Ps 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
19Ps 51:11 Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
19Ps 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
19Ps 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
19Ps 51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
19Ps 51:15 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
19Ps 51:16 For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
19Ps 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
19Ps 51:18 Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;
19Ps 51:19 then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19Ps 52:1 [To the choirmaster. A Maskil of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech."] Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day.
19Ps 52:2 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.
19Ps 52:3 You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah
19Ps 52:4 You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
19Ps 52:5 But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
19Ps 52:6 The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
19Ps 52:7 "See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!"
19Ps 52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.
19Ps 52:9 I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.
19Ps 53:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David.] The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good.
19Ps 53:2 God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
19Ps 53:3 They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
19Ps 53:4 Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
19Ps 53:5 There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
19Ps 53:6 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
19Ps 54:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, "Is not David hiding among us?"] O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might.
19Ps 54:2 O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
19Ps 54:3 For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah
19Ps 54:4 Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
19Ps 54:5 He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.
19Ps 54:6 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good.
19Ps 54:7 For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
19Ps 55:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David.] Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!
19Ps 55:2 Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan,
19Ps 55:3 because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me.
19Ps 55:4 My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
19Ps 55:5 Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
19Ps 55:6 And I say, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
19Ps 55:7 yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah
19Ps 55:8 I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest."
19Ps 55:9 Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.
19Ps 55:10 Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;
19Ps 55:11 ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.
19Ps 55:12 For it is not an enemy who taunts me-- then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me-- then I could hide from him.
19Ps 55:13 But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.
19Ps 55:14 We used to take sweet counsel together; within God's house we walked in the throng.
19Ps 55:15 Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.
19Ps 55:16 But I call to God, and the LORD will save me.
19Ps 55:17 Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice.
19Ps 55:18 He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
19Ps 55:19 God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah because they do not change and do not fear God.
19Ps 55:20 My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant.
19Ps 55:21 His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
19Ps 55:22 Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
19Ps 55:23 But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.
19Ps 56:1 [To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.] Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me;
19Ps 56:2 my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly.
19Ps 56:3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
19Ps 56:4 In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?
19Ps 56:5 All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
19Ps 56:6 They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.
19Ps 56:7 For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!
19Ps 56:8 You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?
19Ps 56:9 Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.
19Ps 56:10 In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
19Ps 56:11 in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?
19Ps 56:12 I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.
19Ps 56:13 For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
19Ps 57:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.] Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.
19Ps 57:2 I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
19Ps 57:3 He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!
19Ps 57:4 My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts-- the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
19Ps 57:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
19Ps 57:6 They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
19Ps 57:7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!
19Ps 57:8 Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!
19Ps 57:9 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.
19Ps 57:10 For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
19Ps 57:11 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
19Ps 58:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David.] Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?
19Ps 58:2 No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.
19Ps 58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
19Ps 58:4 They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
19Ps 58:5 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.
19Ps 58:6 O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!
19Ps 58:7 Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.
19Ps 58:8 Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.
19Ps 58:9 Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!
19Ps 58:10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.
19Ps 58:11 Mankind will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."
19Ps 59:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.] Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me;
19Ps 59:2 deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men.
19Ps 59:3 For behold, they lie in wait for my life; fierce men stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD,
19Ps 59:4 for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake, come to meet me, and see!
19Ps 59:5 You, LORD God of hosts, are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah
19Ps 59:6 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
19Ps 59:7 There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips-- for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"
19Ps 59:8 But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision.
19Ps 59:9 O my Strength, I will watch for you, for you, O God, are my fortress.
19Ps 59:10 My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
19Ps 59:11 Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord, our shield!
19Ps 59:12 For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
19Ps 59:13 consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah
19Ps 59:14 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
19Ps 59:15 They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill.
19Ps 59:16 But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.
19Ps 59:17 O my Strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.
19Ps 60:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Shushan Eduth. A Miktam of David; for instruction; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and when Joab on his return struck down twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.] O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us.
19Ps 60:2 You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters.
19Ps 60:3 You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.
19Ps 60:4 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah
19Ps 60:5 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us!
19Ps 60:6 God has spoken in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
19Ps 60:7 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
19Ps 60:8 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19Ps 60:9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19Ps 60:10 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies.
19Ps 60:11 Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!
19Ps 60:12 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
19Ps 61:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. Of David.] Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer;
19Ps 61:2 from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,
19Ps 61:3 for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.
19Ps 61:4 Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah
19Ps 61:5 For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
19Ps 61:6 Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!
19Ps 61:7 May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!
19Ps 61:8 So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day.
19Ps 62:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.] For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.
19Ps 62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.
19Ps 62:3 How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
19Ps 62:4 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah
19Ps 62:5 For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him.
19Ps 62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
19Ps 62:7 On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
19Ps 62:8 Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah
19Ps 62:9 Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.
19Ps 62:10 Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them.
19Ps 62:11 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,
19Ps 62:12 and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.
19Ps 63:1 [A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.] O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
19Ps 63:2 So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.
19Ps 63:3 Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
19Ps 63:4 So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands.
19Ps 63:5 My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,
19Ps 63:6 when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;
19Ps 63:7 for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
19Ps 63:8 My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
19Ps 63:9 But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;
19Ps 63:10 they shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for jackals.
19Ps 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.
19Ps 64:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
19Ps 64:2 Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers,
19Ps 64:3 who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,
19Ps 64:4 shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear.
19Ps 64:5 They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see them?"
19Ps 64:6 They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!
19Ps 64:7 But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly.
19Ps 64:8 They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads.
19Ps 64:9 Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done.
19Ps 64:10 Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!
19Ps 65:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A Song.] Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion, and to you shall vows be performed.
19Ps 65:2 O you who hear prayer, to you shall all flesh come.
19Ps 65:3 When iniquities prevail against me, you atone for our transgressions.
19Ps 65:4 Blessed is the one you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple!
19Ps 65:5 By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas;
19Ps 65:6 the one who by his strength established the mountains, being girded with might;
19Ps 65:7 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, the tumult of the peoples,
19Ps 65:8 so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs. You make the going out of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.
19Ps 65:9 You visit the earth and water it; you greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; you provide their grain, for so you have prepared it.
19Ps 65:10 You water its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges, softening it with showers, and blessing its growth.
19Ps 65:11 You crown the year with your bounty; your wagon tracks overflow with abundance.
19Ps 65:12 The pastures of the wilderness overflow, the hills gird themselves with joy,
19Ps 65:13 the meadows clothe themselves with flocks, the valleys deck themselves with grain, they shout and sing together for joy.
19Ps 66:1 [To the choirmaster. A Song. A Psalm.] Shout for joy to God, all the earth;
19Ps 66:2 sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise!
19Ps 66:3 Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.
19Ps 66:4 All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name." Selah
19Ps 66:5 Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.
19Ps 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,
19Ps 66:7 who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations-- let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
19Ps 66:8 Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard,
19Ps 66:9 who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip.
19Ps 66:10 For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried.
19Ps 66:11 You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs;
19Ps 66:12 you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.
19Ps 66:13 I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you,
19Ps 66:14 that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
19Ps 66:15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah
19Ps 66:16 Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul.
19Ps 66:17 I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.
19Ps 66:18 If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
19Ps 66:19 But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
19Ps 66:20 Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!
19Ps 67:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song.] May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face to shine upon us, Selah
19Ps 67:2 that your way may be known on earth, your saving power among all nations.
19Ps 67:3 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you!
19Ps 67:4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you judge the peoples with equity and guide the nations upon earth. Selah
19Ps 67:5 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you!
19Ps 67:6 The earth has yielded its increase; God, our God, shall bless us.
19Ps 67:7 God shall bless us; let all the ends of the earth fear him!
19Ps 68:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A Song.] God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered; and those who hate him shall flee before him!
19Ps 68:2 As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away; as wax melts before fire, so the wicked shall perish before God!
19Ps 68:3 But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy!
19Ps 68:4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts; his name is the LORD; exult before him!
19Ps 68:5 Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.
19Ps 68:6 God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
19Ps 68:7 O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah
19Ps 68:8 the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
19Ps 68:9 Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished;
19Ps 68:10 your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.
19Ps 68:11 The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host:
19Ps 68:12 "The kings of the armies--they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil--
19Ps 68:13 though you men lie among the sheepfolds-- the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold.
19Ps 68:14 When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon.
19Ps 68:15 O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!
19Ps 68:16 Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, yes, where the LORD will dwell forever?
19Ps 68:17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.
19Ps 68:18 You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.
19Ps 68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah
19Ps 68:20 Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.
19Ps 68:21 But God will strike the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.
19Ps 68:22 The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
19Ps 68:23 that you may strike your feet in their blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe."
19Ps 68:24 Your procession is seen, O God, the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary--
19Ps 68:25 the singers in front, the musicians last, between them virgins playing tambourines:
19Ps 68:26 "Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"
19Ps 68:27 There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
19Ps 68:28 Summon your power, O God, the power, O God, by which you have worked for us.
19Ps 68:29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bear gifts to you.
19Ps 68:30 Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.
19Ps 68:31 Nobles shall come from Egypt; Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God.
19Ps 68:32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, Selah
19Ps 68:33 to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.
19Ps 68:34 Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies.
19Ps 68:35 Awesome is God from his sanctuary; the God of Israel--he is the one who gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!
19Ps 69:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. Of David.] Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck.
19Ps 69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
19Ps 69:3 I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.
19Ps 69:4 More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore?
19Ps 69:5 O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.
19Ps 69:6 Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
19Ps 69:7 For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that dishonor has covered my face.
19Ps 69:8 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons.
19Ps 69:9 For zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
19Ps 69:10 When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.
19Ps 69:11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
19Ps 69:12 I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.
19Ps 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.
19Ps 69:14 Deliver me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.
19Ps 69:15 Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.
19Ps 69:16 Answer me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.
19Ps 69:17 Hide not your face from your servant; for I am in distress; make haste to answer me.
19Ps 69:18 Draw near to my soul, redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies!
19Ps 69:19 You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to you.
19Ps 69:20 Reproaches have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none.
19Ps 69:21 They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.
19Ps 69:22 Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace, let it become a trap.
19Ps 69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
19Ps 69:24 Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
19Ps 69:25 May their camp be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents.
19Ps 69:26 For they persecute him whom you have struck down, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.
19Ps 69:27 Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you.
19Ps 69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.
19Ps 69:29 But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high!
19Ps 69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
19Ps 69:31 This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.
19Ps 69:32 When the humble see it they will be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
19Ps 69:33 For the LORD hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.
19Ps 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.
19Ps 69:35 For God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah, and people shall dwell there and possess it;
19Ps 69:36 the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it.
19Ps 70:1 [To the choirmaster. Of David, for the memorial offering.] Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!
19Ps 70:2 Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
19Ps 70:3 Let them turn back because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!"
19Ps 70:4 May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!"
19Ps 70:5 But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!
19Ps 71:1 In you, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame!
19Ps 71:2 In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me, and save me!
19Ps 71:3 Be to me a rock of refuge, to which I may continually come; you have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
19Ps 71:4 Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.
19Ps 71:5 For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth.
19Ps 71:6 Upon you I have leaned from before my birth; you are he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of you.
19Ps 71:7 I have been as a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.
19Ps 71:8 My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all the day.
19Ps 71:9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent.
19Ps 71:10 For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together
19Ps 71:11 and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him."
19Ps 71:12 O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!
19Ps 71:13 May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt.
19Ps 71:14 But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more.
19Ps 71:15 My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge.
19Ps 71:16 With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone.
19Ps 71:17 O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.
19Ps 71:18 So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come.
19Ps 71:19 Your righteousness, O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?
19Ps 71:20 You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
19Ps 71:21 You will increase my greatness and comfort me again.
19Ps 71:22 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 71:23 My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed.
19Ps 71:24 And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt.
19Ps 72:1 [Of Solomon.] Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son!
19Ps 72:2 May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice!
19Ps 72:3 Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness!
19Ps 72:4 May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor!
19Ps 72:5 May they fear you while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations!
19Ps 72:6 May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth!
19Ps 72:7 In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more!
19Ps 72:8 May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!
19Ps 72:9 May desert tribes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust!
19Ps 72:10 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!
19Ps 72:11 May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him!
19Ps 72:12 For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper.
19Ps 72:13 He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy.
19Ps 72:14 From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight.
19Ps 72:15 Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day!
19Ps 72:16 May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field!
19Ps 72:17 May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed!
19Ps 72:18 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
19Ps 72:19 Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen!
19Ps 72:20 The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
19Ps 73:1 [A Psalm of Asaph.] Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
19Ps 73:2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped.
19Ps 73:3 For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19Ps 73:4 For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek.
19Ps 73:5 They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.
19Ps 73:6 Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment.
19Ps 73:7 Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.
19Ps 73:8 They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.
19Ps 73:9 They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.
19Ps 73:10 Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them.
19Ps 73:11 And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
19Ps 73:12 Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.
19Ps 73:13 All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.
19Ps 73:14 For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning.
19Ps 73:15 If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
19Ps 73:16 But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,
19Ps 73:17 until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end.
19Ps 73:18 Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.
19Ps 73:19 How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!
19Ps 73:20 Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms.
19Ps 73:21 When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,
19Ps 73:22 I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you.
19Ps 73:23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
19Ps 73:24 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory.
19Ps 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
19Ps 73:26 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19Ps 73:27 For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.
19Ps 73:28 But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
19Ps 74:1 [A Maskil of Asaph.] O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
19Ps 74:2 Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.
19Ps 74:3 Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!
19Ps 74:4 Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they set up their own signs for signs.
19Ps 74:5 They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees.
19Ps 74:6 And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers.
19Ps 74:7 They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground.
19Ps 74:8 They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
19Ps 74:9 We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long.
19Ps 74:10 How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever?
19Ps 74:11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them!
19Ps 74:12 Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
19Ps 74:13 You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.
19Ps 74:14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
19Ps 74:15 You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.
19Ps 74:16 Yours is the day, yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun.
19Ps 74:17 You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter.
19Ps 74:18 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name.
19Ps 74:19 Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever.
19Ps 74:20 Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
19Ps 74:21 Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.
19Ps 74:22 Arise, O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day!
19Ps 74:23 Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!
19Ps 75:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.] We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds.
19Ps 75:2 "At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity.
19Ps 75:3 When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah
19Ps 75:4 I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn;
19Ps 75:5 do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'"
19Ps 75:6 For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,
19Ps 75:7 but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.
19Ps 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.
19Ps 75:9 But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19Ps 75:10 All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
19Ps 76:1 [To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.] In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.
19Ps 76:2 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
19Ps 76:3 There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah
19Ps 76:4 Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains of prey.
19Ps 76:5 The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands.
19Ps 76:6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned.
19Ps 76:7 But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused?
19Ps 76:8 From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still,
19Ps 76:9 when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah
19Ps 76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt.
19Ps 76:11 Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,
19Ps 76:12 who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
19Ps 77:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.] I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me.
19Ps 77:2 In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.
19Ps 77:3 When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah
19Ps 77:4 You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
19Ps 77:5 I consider the days of old, the years long ago.
19Ps 77:6 I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart." Then my spirit made a diligent search:
19Ps 77:7 "Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?
19Ps 77:8 Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time?
19Ps 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah
19Ps 77:10 Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High."
19Ps 77:11 I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old.
19Ps 77:12 I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds.
19Ps 77:13 Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God?
19Ps 77:14 You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples.
19Ps 77:15 You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
19Ps 77:16 When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled.
19Ps 77:17 The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side.
19Ps 77:18 The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
19Ps 77:19 Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen.
19Ps 77:20 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19Ps 78:1 [A Maskil of Asaph.] Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
19Ps 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,
19Ps 78:3 things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.
19Ps 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.
19Ps 78:5 He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children,
19Ps 78:6 that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children,
19Ps 78:7 so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
19Ps 78:8 and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
19Ps 78:9 The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.
19Ps 78:10 They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.
19Ps 78:11 They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.
19Ps 78:12 In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
19Ps 78:13 He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.
19Ps 78:14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.
19Ps 78:15 He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
19Ps 78:16 He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
19Ps 78:17 Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
19Ps 78:18 They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.
19Ps 78:19 They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
19Ps 78:20 He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?"
19Ps 78:21 Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,
19Ps 78:22 because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.
19Ps 78:23 Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,
19Ps 78:24 and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.
19Ps 78:25 Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.
19Ps 78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;
19Ps 78:27 he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;
19Ps 78:28 he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
19Ps 78:29 And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
19Ps 78:30 But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
19Ps 78:31 the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.
19Ps 78:32 In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe.
19Ps 78:33 So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.
19Ps 78:34 When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.
19Ps 78:35 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.
19Ps 78:36 But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
19Ps 78:37 Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant.
19Ps 78:38 Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath.
19Ps 78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.
19Ps 78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
19Ps 78:41 They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 78:42 They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,
19Ps 78:43 when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.
19Ps 78:44 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
19Ps 78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
19Ps 78:46 He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
19Ps 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.
19Ps 78:48 He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.
19Ps 78:49 He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
19Ps 78:50 He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
19Ps 78:51 He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
19Ps 78:52 Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
19Ps 78:53 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
19Ps 78:54 And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.
19Ps 78:55 He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
19Ps 78:56 Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,
19Ps 78:57 but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.
19Ps 78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
19Ps 78:59 When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
19Ps 78:60 He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,
19Ps 78:61 and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.
19Ps 78:62 He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.
19Ps 78:63 Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.
19Ps 78:64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
19Ps 78:65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.
19Ps 78:66 And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.
19Ps 78:67 He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
19Ps 78:68 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
19Ps 78:69 He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.
19Ps 78:70 He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
19Ps 78:71 from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.
19Ps 78:72 With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.
19Ps 79:1 [A Psalm of Asaph.] O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
19Ps 79:2 They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.
19Ps 79:3 They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
19Ps 79:4 We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.
19Ps 79:5 How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
19Ps 79:6 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name!
19Ps 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.
19Ps 79:8 Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.
19Ps 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name's sake!
19Ps 79:10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes!
19Ps 79:11 Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die!
19Ps 79:12 Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!
19Ps 79:13 But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
19Ps 80:1 [To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Testimony. Of Asaph, a Psalm.] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.
19Ps 80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!
19Ps 80:3 Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!
19Ps 80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?
19Ps 80:5 You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure.
19Ps 80:6 You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
19Ps 80:7 Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved!
19Ps 80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
19Ps 80:9 You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
19Ps 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.
19Ps 80:11 It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.
19Ps 80:12 Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
19Ps 80:13 The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
19Ps 80:14 Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,
19Ps 80:15 the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.
19Ps 80:16 They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!
19Ps 80:17 But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!
19Ps 80:18 Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name!
19Ps 80:19 Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!
19Ps 81:1 [To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. Of Asaph.] Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!
19Ps 81:2 Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.
19Ps 81:3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
19Ps 81:4 For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob.
19Ps 81:5 He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known:
19Ps 81:6 "I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.
19Ps 81:7 In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
19Ps 81:8 Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
19Ps 81:9 There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
19Ps 81:10 I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
19Ps 81:11 "But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.
19Ps 81:12 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.
19Ps 81:13 Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
19Ps 81:14 I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.
19Ps 81:15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever.
19Ps 81:16 But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
19Ps 82:1 [A Psalm of Asaph.] God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:
19Ps 82:2 "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
19Ps 82:3 Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.
19Ps 82:4 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."
19Ps 82:5 They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
19Ps 82:6 I said, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you;
19Ps 82:7 nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince."
19Ps 82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!
19Ps 83:1 [A Song. A Psalm of Asaph.] O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God!
19Ps 83:2 For behold, your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have raised their heads.
19Ps 83:3 They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against your treasured ones.
19Ps 83:4 They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!"
19Ps 83:5 For they conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant--
19Ps 83:6 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
19Ps 83:7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
19Ps 83:8 Asshur also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah
19Ps 83:9 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
19Ps 83:10 who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground.
19Ps 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
19Ps 83:12 who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God."
19Ps 83:13 O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind.
19Ps 83:14 As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
19Ps 83:15 so may you pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane!
19Ps 83:16 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O LORD.
19Ps 83:17 Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace,
19Ps 83:18 that they may know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
19Ps 84:1 [To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts!
19Ps 84:2 My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.
19Ps 84:3 Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.
19Ps 84:4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise! Selah
19Ps 84:5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
19Ps 84:6 As they go through the Valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools.
19Ps 84:7 They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion.
19Ps 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah
19Ps 84:9 Behold our shield, O God; look on the face of your anointed!
19Ps 84:10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
19Ps 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
19Ps 84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!
19Ps 85:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] LORD, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
19Ps 85:2 You forgave the iniquity of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah
19Ps 85:3 You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your hot anger.
19Ps 85:4 Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us!
19Ps 85:5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger to all generations?
19Ps 85:6 Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
19Ps 85:7 Show us your steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.
19Ps 85:8 Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly.
19Ps 85:9 Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
19Ps 85:10 Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other.
19Ps 85:11 Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from the sky.
19Ps 85:12 Yes, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase.
19Ps 85:13 Righteousness will go before him and make his footsteps a way.
19Ps 86:1 [A Prayer of David.] Incline your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
19Ps 86:2 Preserve my life, for I am godly; save your servant, who trusts in you--you are my God.
19Ps 86:3 Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day.
19Ps 86:4 Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
19Ps 86:5 For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you.
19Ps 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace.
19Ps 86:7 In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me.
19Ps 86:8 There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
19Ps 86:9 All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.
19Ps 86:10 For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God.
19Ps 86:11 Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name.
19Ps 86:12 I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever.
19Ps 86:13 For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
19Ps 86:14 O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, and they do not set you before them.
19Ps 86:15 But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
19Ps 86:16 Turn to me and be gracious to me; give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maidservant.
19Ps 86:17 Show me a sign of your favor, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
19Ps 87:1 [A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. A Song.] On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
19Ps 87:2 the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.
19Ps 87:3 Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah
19Ps 87:4 Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush-- "This one was born there," they say.
19Ps 87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her.
19Ps 87:6 The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah
19Ps 87:7 Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you."
19Ps 88:1 [A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.] O LORD, God of my salvation; I cry out day and night before you.
19Ps 88:2 Let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry!
19Ps 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.
19Ps 88:4 I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am a man who has no strength,
19Ps 88:5 like one set loose among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.
19Ps 88:6 You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep.
19Ps 88:7 Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah
19Ps 88:8 You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;
19Ps 88:9 my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you.
19Ps 88:10 Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah
19Ps 88:11 Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?
19Ps 88:12 Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
19Ps 88:13 But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
19Ps 88:14 O LORD, why do you cast my soul away? Why do you hide your face from me?
19Ps 88:15 Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am helpless.
19Ps 88:16 Your wrath has swept over me; your dreadful assaults destroy me.
19Ps 88:17 They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in on me together.
19Ps 88:18 You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me; my companions have become darkness.
19Ps 89:1 [A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.] I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
19Ps 89:2 For I said, "Steadfast love will be built up forever; in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness."
19Ps 89:3 You have said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant:
19Ps 89:4 'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah
19Ps 89:5 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!
19Ps 89:6 For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD,
19Ps 89:7 a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him?
19Ps 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you?
19Ps 89:9 You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.
19Ps 89:10 You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
19Ps 89:11 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.
19Ps 89:12 The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.
19Ps 89:13 You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.
19Ps 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.
19Ps 89:15 Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face,
19Ps 89:16 who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted.
19Ps 89:17 For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted.
19Ps 89:18 For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 89:19 Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: "I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
19Ps 89:20 I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him,
19Ps 89:21 so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him.
19Ps 89:22 The enemy shall not outwit him; the wicked shall not humble him.
19Ps 89:23 I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
19Ps 89:24 My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
19Ps 89:25 I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.
19Ps 89:26 He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.'
19Ps 89:27 And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
19Ps 89:28 My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.
19Ps 89:29 I will establish his offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
19Ps 89:30 If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules,
19Ps 89:31 if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
19Ps 89:32 then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes,
19Ps 89:33 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.
19Ps 89:34 I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
19Ps 89:35 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
19Ps 89:36 His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me.
19Ps 89:37 Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies." Selah
19Ps 89:38 But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed.
19Ps 89:39 You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.
19Ps 89:40 You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.
19Ps 89:41 All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
19Ps 89:42 You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
19Ps 89:43 You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle.
19Ps 89:44 You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground.
19Ps 89:45 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah
19Ps 89:46 How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
19Ps 89:47 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man!
19Ps 89:48 What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
19Ps 89:49 Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?
19Ps 89:50 Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,
19Ps 89:51 with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.
19Ps 89:52 Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.
19Ps 90:1 [A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.] Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
19Ps 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
19Ps 90:3 You return man to dust and say, "Return, O children of man!"
19Ps 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.
19Ps 90:5 You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning:
19Ps 90:6 in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.
19Ps 90:7 For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed.
19Ps 90:8 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
19Ps 90:9 For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
19Ps 90:10 The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.
19Ps 90:11 Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you?
19Ps 90:12 So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.
19Ps 90:13 Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants!
19Ps 90:14 Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
19Ps 90:15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil.
19Ps 90:16 Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children.
19Ps 90:17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!
19Ps 91:1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
19Ps 91:2 I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."
19Ps 91:3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.
19Ps 91:4 He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
19Ps 91:5 You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
19Ps 91:6 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.
19Ps 91:7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
19Ps 91:8 You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.
19Ps 91:9 Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place-- the Most High, who is my refuge--
19Ps 91:10 no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent.
19Ps 91:11 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
19Ps 91:12 On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
19Ps 91:13 You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.
19Ps 91:14 "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.
19Ps 91:15 When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.
19Ps 91:16 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."
19Ps 92:1 [A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath.] It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
19Ps 92:2 to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
19Ps 92:3 to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
19Ps 92:4 For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
19Ps 92:5 How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!
19Ps 92:6 The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:
19Ps 92:7 that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;
19Ps 92:8 but you, O LORD, are on high forever.
19Ps 92:9 For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
19Ps 92:10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
19Ps 92:11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
19Ps 92:12 The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19Ps 92:13 They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.
19Ps 92:14 They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,
19Ps 92:15 to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
19Ps 93:1 The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
19Ps 93:2 Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
19Ps 93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
19Ps 93:4 Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty!
19Ps 93:5 Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
19Ps 94:1 O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!
19Ps 94:2 Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!
19Ps 94:3 O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
19Ps 94:4 They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
19Ps 94:5 They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.
19Ps 94:6 They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
19Ps 94:7 and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."
19Ps 94:8 Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
19Ps 94:9 He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
19Ps 94:10 He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge--
19Ps 94:11 the LORD--knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
19Ps 94:12 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law,
19Ps 94:13 to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19Ps 94:14 For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
19Ps 94:15 for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19Ps 94:16 Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
19Ps 94:17 If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
19Ps 94:18 When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.
19Ps 94:19 When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
19Ps 94:20 Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?
19Ps 94:21 They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
19Ps 94:22 But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
19Ps 94:23 He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
19Ps 95:1 Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
19Ps 95:2 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
19Ps 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
19Ps 95:4 In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.
19Ps 95:5 The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
19Ps 95:6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!
19Ps 95:7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice,
19Ps 95:8 do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
19Ps 95:9 when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.
19Ps 95:10 For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways."
19Ps 95:11 Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They shall not enter my rest."
19Ps 96:1 Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth!
19Ps 96:2 Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.
19Ps 96:3 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!
19Ps 96:4 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
19Ps 96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
19Ps 96:6 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
19Ps 96:7 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!
19Ps 96:8 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts!
19Ps 96:9 Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth!
19Ps 96:10 Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity."
19Ps 96:11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
19Ps 96:12 let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
19Ps 96:13 before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
19Ps 97:1 The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!
19Ps 97:2 Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19Ps 97:3 Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around.
19Ps 97:4 His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
19Ps 97:5 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
19Ps 97:6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
19Ps 97:7 All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; worship him, all you gods!
19Ps 97:8 Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O LORD.
19Ps 97:9 For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
19Ps 97:10 O you who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
19Ps 97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
19Ps 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!
19Ps 98:1 [A Psalm.] Oh sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
19Ps 98:2 The LORD has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
19Ps 98:3 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19Ps 98:4 Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises!
19Ps 98:5 Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody!
19Ps 98:6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD!
19Ps 98:7 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it!
19Ps 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together
19Ps 98:9 before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
19Ps 99:1 The LORD reigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!
19Ps 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples.
19Ps 99:3 Let them praise your great and awesome name! Holy is he!
19Ps 99:4 The King in his might loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19Ps 99:5 Exalt the LORD our God; worship at his footstool! Holy is he!
19Ps 99:6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called upon his name. They called to the LORD, and he answered them.
19Ps 99:7 In the pillar of the cloud he spoke to them; they kept his testimonies and the statute that he gave them.
19Ps 99:8 O LORD our God, you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
19Ps 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy!
19Ps 100:1 [A Psalm for giving thanks.] Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth!
19Ps 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!
19Ps 100:3 Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
19Ps 100:4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name!
19Ps 100:5 For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
19Ps 101:1 [A Psalm of David.] I will sing of steadfast love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will make music.
19Ps 101:2 I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;
19Ps 101:3 I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
19Ps 101:4 A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.
19Ps 101:5 Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. Whoever has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure.
19Ps 101:6 I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.
19Ps 101:7 No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.
19Ps 101:8 Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all the evildoers from the city of the LORD.
19Ps 102:1 [A Prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the LORD.] Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you!
19Ps 102:2 Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!
19Ps 102:3 For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.
19Ps 102:4 My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread.
19Ps 102:5 Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh.
19Ps 102:6 I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;
19Ps 102:7 I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.
19Ps 102:8 All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.
19Ps 102:9 For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink,
19Ps 102:10 because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down.
19Ps 102:11 My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
19Ps 102:12 But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations.
19Ps 102:13 You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.
19Ps 102:14 For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust.
19Ps 102:15 Nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.
19Ps 102:16 For the LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory;
19Ps 102:17 he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.
19Ps 102:18 Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD:
19Ps 102:19 that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,
19Ps 102:20 to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die,
19Ps 102:21 that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise,
19Ps 102:22 when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD.
19Ps 102:23 He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.
19Ps 102:24 "O my God," I say, "take me not away in the midst of my days-- you whose years endure throughout all generations!"
19Ps 102:25 Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19Ps 102:26 They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,
19Ps 102:27 but you are the same, and your years have no end.
19Ps 102:28 The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.
19Ps 103:1 [Of David.] Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!
19Ps 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
19Ps 103:3 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,
19Ps 103:4 who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
19Ps 103:5 who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
19Ps 103:6 The LORD works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.
19Ps 103:7 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.
19Ps 103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
19Ps 103:9 He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever.
19Ps 103:10 He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
19Ps 103:11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
19Ps 103:12 as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
19Ps 103:13 As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him.
19Ps 103:14 For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
19Ps 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;
19Ps 103:16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.
19Ps 103:17 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children,
19Ps 103:18 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.
19Ps 103:19 The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
19Ps 103:20 Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word!
19Ps 103:21 Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will!
19Ps 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
19Ps 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty,
19Ps 104:2 covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent.
19Ps 104:3 He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind;
19Ps 104:4 he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire.
19Ps 104:5 He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.
19Ps 104:6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19Ps 104:7 At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight.
19Ps 104:8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them.
19Ps 104:9 You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.
19Ps 104:10 You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills;
19Ps 104:11 they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19Ps 104:12 Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches.
19Ps 104:13 From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.
19Ps 104:14 You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth
19Ps 104:15 and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man's heart.
19Ps 104:16 The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
19Ps 104:17 In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees.
19Ps 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
19Ps 104:19 He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.
19Ps 104:20 You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about.
19Ps 104:21 The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
19Ps 104:22 When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens.
19Ps 104:23 Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.
19Ps 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19Ps 104:25 Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great.
19Ps 104:26 There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.
19Ps 104:27 These all look to you, to give them their food in due season.
19Ps 104:28 When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
19Ps 104:29 When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
19Ps 104:30 When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
19Ps 104:31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works,
19Ps 104:32 who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke!
19Ps 104:33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
19Ps 104:34 May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.
19Ps 104:35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!
19Ps 105:1 Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!
19Ps 105:2 Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!
19Ps 105:3 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!
19Ps 105:4 Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually!
19Ps 105:5 Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
19Ps 105:6 O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
19Ps 105:7 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
19Ps 105:8 He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
19Ps 105:9 the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
19Ps 105:10 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
19Ps 105:11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."
19Ps 105:12 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
19Ps 105:13 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
19Ps 105:14 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
19Ps 105:15 saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"
19Ps 105:16 When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,
19Ps 105:17 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19Ps 105:18 His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;
19Ps 105:19 until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.
19Ps 105:20 The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;
19Ps 105:21 he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,
19Ps 105:22 to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.
19Ps 105:23 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:24 And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.
19Ps 105:25 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
19Ps 105:26 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
19Ps 105:27 They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:28 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.
19Ps 105:29 He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
19Ps 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
19Ps 105:31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19Ps 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.
19Ps 105:33 He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
19Ps 105:34 He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number,
19Ps 105:35 which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.
19Ps 105:36 He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.
19Ps 105:37 Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
19Ps 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
19Ps 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
19Ps 105:40 They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
19Ps 105:41 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.
19Ps 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.
19Ps 105:43 So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
19Ps 105:44 And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,
19Ps 105:45 that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!
19Ps 106:1 Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!
19Ps 106:2 Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, or declare all his praise?
19Ps 106:3 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them,
19Ps 106:5 that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
19Ps 106:6 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.
19Ps 106:7 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:8 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.
19Ps 106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
19Ps 106:10 So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
19Ps 106:11 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
19Ps 106:12 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
19Ps 106:13 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
19Ps 106:14 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
19Ps 106:15 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
19Ps 106:16 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
19Ps 106:17 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
19Ps 106:18 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
19Ps 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.
19Ps 106:20 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
19Ps 106:21 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
19Ps 106:22 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:23 Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
19Ps 106:24 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
19Ps 106:25 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.
19Ps 106:26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
19Ps 106:27 and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.
19Ps 106:28 Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
19Ps 106:29 they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
19Ps 106:30 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.
19Ps 106:31 And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.
19Ps 106:32 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,
19Ps 106:33 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
19Ps 106:34 They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,
19Ps 106:35 but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.
19Ps 106:36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
19Ps 106:37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
19Ps 106:38 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
19Ps 106:39 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.
19Ps 106:40 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
19Ps 106:41 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
19Ps 106:42 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
19Ps 106:43 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.
19Ps 106:44 Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
19Ps 106:45 For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
19Ps 106:46 He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
19Ps 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
19Ps 106:48 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!
19Ps 107:1 Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!
19Ps 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble
19Ps 107:3 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
19Ps 107:4 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;
19Ps 107:5 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
19Ps 107:6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:7 He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in.
19Ps 107:8 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
19Ps 107:9 For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.
19Ps 107:10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,
19Ps 107:11 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
19Ps 107:12 So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.
19Ps 107:13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart.
19Ps 107:15 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
19Ps 107:16 For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron.
19Ps 107:17 Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
19Ps 107:18 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.
19Ps 107:19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:20 He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.
19Ps 107:21 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
19Ps 107:22 And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
19Ps 107:23 Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;
19Ps 107:24 they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.
19Ps 107:25 For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.
19Ps 107:26 They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;
19Ps 107:27 they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits' end.
19Ps 107:28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:29 He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
19Ps 107:30 Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.
19Ps 107:31 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
19Ps 107:32 Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
19Ps 107:33 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
19Ps 107:34 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants.
19Ps 107:35 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.
19Ps 107:36 And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;
19Ps 107:37 they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield.
19Ps 107:38 By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish.
19Ps 107:39 When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil, and sorrow,
19Ps 107:40 he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
19Ps 107:41 but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks.
19Ps 107:42 The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
19Ps 107:43 Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.
19Ps 108:1 [A Song. A Psalm of David.] My heart is steadfast, O God! I will sing and make melody with all my being!
19Ps 108:2 Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!
19Ps 108:3 I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.
19Ps 108:4 For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
19Ps 108:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
19Ps 108:6 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me!
19Ps 108:7 God has promised in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth.
19Ps 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.
19Ps 108:9 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19Ps 108:10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19Ps 108:11 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.
19Ps 108:12 Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!
19Ps 108:13 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
19Ps 109:1 [To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] Be not silent, O God of my praise!
19Ps 109:2 For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.
19Ps 109:3 They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.
19Ps 109:4 In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer.
19Ps 109:5 So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
19Ps 109:6 Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand at his right hand.
19Ps 109:7 When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!
19Ps 109:8 May his days be few; may another take his office!
19Ps 109:9 May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow!
19Ps 109:10 May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit!
19Ps 109:11 May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!
19Ps 109:12 Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!
19Ps 109:13 May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!
19Ps 109:14 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!
19Ps 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth!
19Ps 109:16 For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death.
19Ps 109:17 He loved to curse; let curses come upon him! He did not delight in blessing; may it be far from him!
19Ps 109:18 He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!
19Ps 109:19 May it be like a garment that he wraps around him, like a belt that he puts on every day!
19Ps 109:20 May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life!
19Ps 109:21 But you, O GOD my Lord, deal on my behalf for your name's sake; because your steadfast love is good, deliver me!
19Ps 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me.
19Ps 109:23 I am gone like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.
19Ps 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt, with no fat.
19Ps 109:25 I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads.
19Ps 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to your steadfast love!
19Ps 109:27 Let them know that this is your hand; you, O LORD, have done it!
19Ps 109:28 Let them curse, but you will bless! They arise and are put to shame, but your servant will be glad!
19Ps 109:29 May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!
19Ps 109:30 With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
19Ps 109:31 For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.
19Ps 110:1 [A Psalm of David.] The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."

19Ps 112:6 For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever.
19Ps 112:7 He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.
19Ps 112:8 His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.
19Ps 112:9 He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor.
19Ps 112:10 The wicked man sees it and is angry; he gnashes his teeth and melts away; the desire of the wicked will perish!

19Ps 113:3 From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised!

19Ps 113:5 Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high,
19Ps 113:6 who looks far down on the heavens and the earth?
19Ps 113:7 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap,
19Ps 113:8 to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people.
19Ps 113:9 He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!
19Ps 114:1 When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
19Ps 114:2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
19Ps 114:3 The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back.
19Ps 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
19Ps 114:5 What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
19Ps 114:6 O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
19Ps 114:7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
19Ps 114:8 who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
19Ps 115:1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!

19Ps 115:3 Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases.
19Ps 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
19Ps 115:5 They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.
19Ps 115:6 They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.
19Ps 115:7 They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat.

19Ps 118:13 I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me.
19Ps 118:14 The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.

19Ps 130:4 But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.
19Ps 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;
19Ps 130:6 my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.
19Ps 130:7 O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption.

19Ps 131:1 [A Song of Ascents. Of David.] O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
19Ps 131:2 But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.
19Ps 131:3 O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
19Ps 132:1 [A Song of Ascents.] Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured,
19Ps 132:2 how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
19Ps 132:3 "I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
19Ps 132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
19Ps 132:5 until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."
19Ps 132:6 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
19Ps 132:7 "Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!"
19Ps 132:8 Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
19Ps 132:9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy.
19Ps 132:10 For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one.
19Ps 132:11 The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.
19Ps 132:12 If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne."
19Ps 132:13 For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place:
19Ps 132:14 "This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
19Ps 132:15 I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
19Ps 132:16 Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy.
19Ps 132:17 There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
19Ps 132:18 His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."
19Ps 133:1 [A Song of Ascents. Of David.] Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!
19Ps 133:2 It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes!

19Ps 134:1 [A Song of Ascents.] Come, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, who stand by night in the house of the LORD!

19Ps 137:1 By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.

19Ps 139:4 Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.

19Ps 144:1 [Of David.] Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;

19Ps 144:3 O LORD, what is man that you regard him, or the son of man that you think of him?

19Ps 144:11 Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
19Ps 144:12 May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace;
19Ps 144:13 may our granaries be full, providing all kinds of produce; may our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
19Ps 144:14 may our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no mishap or failure in bearing; may there be no cry of distress in our streets!

20Pr 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
20Pr 1:2 To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,
20Pr 1:3 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;
20Pr 1:4 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth--
20Pr 1:5 Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,
20Pr 1:6 to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.
20Pr 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.
20Pr 1:8 Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,
20Pr 1:9 for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.
20Pr 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
20Pr 1:11 If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;
20Pr 1:12 like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
20Pr 1:13 we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;
20Pr 1:14 throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"--
20Pr 1:15 my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,
20Pr 1:16 for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
20Pr 1:17 For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,
20Pr 1:18 but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.
20Pr 1:19 Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.
20Pr 1:20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;
20Pr 1:21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
20Pr 1:22 "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?
20Pr 1:23 If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.
20Pr 1:24 Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,
20Pr 1:25 because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,
20Pr 1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,
20Pr 1:27 when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
20Pr 1:28 Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.
20Pr 1:29 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,
20Pr 1:30 would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,
20Pr 1:31 therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.
20Pr 1:32 For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;
20Pr 1:33 but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."
20Pr 2:1 My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,
20Pr 2:2 making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;
20Pr 2:3 yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,
20Pr 2:4 if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,
20Pr 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.
20Pr 2:6 For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
20Pr 2:7 he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
20Pr 2:8 guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.
20Pr 2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;
20Pr 2:10 for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
20Pr 2:11 discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,
20Pr 2:12 delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,
20Pr 2:13 who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
20Pr 2:14 who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,
20Pr 2:15 men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.
20Pr 2:16 So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,
20Pr 2:17 who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
20Pr 2:18 for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;
20Pr 2:19 none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.
20Pr 2:20 So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20Pr 2:21 For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,
20Pr 2:22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
20Pr 3:1 My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,
20Pr 3:2 for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.
20Pr 3:3 Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 3:4 So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
20Pr 3:6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.
20Pr 3:7 Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.
20Pr 3:8 It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.
20Pr 3:9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;
20Pr 3:10 then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.
20Pr 3:11 My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,
20Pr 3:12 for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
20Pr 3:13 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,
20Pr 3:14 for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.
20Pr 3:15 She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
20Pr 3:16 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20Pr 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
20Pr 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.
20Pr 3:19 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;
20Pr 3:20 by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.
20Pr 3:21 My son, do not lose sight of these-- keep sound wisdom and discretion,
20Pr 3:22 and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.
20Pr 3:23 Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.
20Pr 3:24 If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20Pr 3:25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,
20Pr 3:26 for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.
20Pr 3:27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.
20Pr 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you.
20Pr 3:29 Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.
20Pr 3:30 Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.
20Pr 3:31 Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,
20Pr 3:32 for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.
20Pr 3:33 The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
20Pr 3:34 Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.
20Pr 3:35 The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.
20Pr 4:1 Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,
20Pr 4:2 for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.
20Pr 4:3 When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,
20Pr 4:4 he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.
20Pr 4:5 Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
20Pr 4:6 Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.
20Pr 4:7 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.
20Pr 4:8 Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
20Pr 4:9 She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."
20Pr 4:10 Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.
20Pr 4:11 I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.
20Pr 4:12 When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.
20Pr 4:13 Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.
20Pr 4:14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.
20Pr 4:15 Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.
20Pr 4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.
20Pr 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20Pr 4:18 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
20Pr 4:19 The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.
20Pr 4:20 My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
20Pr 4:21 Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.
20Pr 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.
20Pr 4:23 Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.
20Pr 4:24 Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.
20Pr 4:25 Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.
20Pr 4:26 Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.
20Pr 4:27 Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.
20Pr 5:1 My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,
20Pr 5:2 that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.
20Pr 5:3 For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,
20Pr 5:4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
20Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;
20Pr 5:6 she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.
20Pr 5:7 And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
20Pr 5:8 Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,
20Pr 5:9 lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,
20Pr 5:10 lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,
20Pr 5:11 and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,
20Pr 5:12 and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
20Pr 5:13 I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
20Pr 5:14 I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."
20Pr 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
20Pr 5:16 Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
20Pr 5:17 Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.
20Pr 5:18 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
20Pr 5:19 a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.
20Pr 5:20 Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
20Pr 5:21 For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.
20Pr 5:22 The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
20Pr 5:23 He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.
20Pr 6:1 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,
20Pr 6:2 if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,
20Pr 6:3 then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.
20Pr 6:4 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;
20Pr 6:5 save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
20Pr 6:6 Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.
20Pr 6:7 Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,
20Pr 6:8 she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.
20Pr 6:9 How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?
20Pr 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
20Pr 6:11 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.
20Pr 6:12 A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,
20Pr 6:13 winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,
20Pr 6:14 with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;
20Pr 6:15 therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.
20Pr 6:16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:
20Pr 6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
20Pr 6:18 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,
20Pr 6:19 a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.
20Pr 6:20 My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.
20Pr 6:21 Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.
20Pr 6:22 When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.
20Pr 6:23 For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
20Pr 6:24 to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
20Pr 6:25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;
20Pr 6:26 for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.
20Pr 6:27 Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?
20Pr 6:28 Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?
20Pr 6:29 So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.
20Pr 6:30 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,
20Pr 6:31 but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.
20Pr 6:32 He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.
20Pr 6:33 He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
20Pr 6:34 For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.
20Pr 6:35 He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.
20Pr 7:1 My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you;
20Pr 7:2 keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;
20Pr 7:3 bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,
20Pr 7:5 to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.
20Pr 7:6 For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,
20Pr 7:7 and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,
20Pr 7:8 passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house
20Pr 7:9 in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.
20Pr 7:10 And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.
20Pr 7:11 She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;
20Pr 7:12 now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait.
20Pr 7:13 She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,
20Pr 7:14 "I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;
20Pr 7:15 so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.
20Pr 7:16 I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;
20Pr 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20Pr 7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.
20Pr 7:19 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;
20Pr 7:20 he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home."
20Pr 7:21 With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.
20Pr 7:22 All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast
20Pr 7:23 till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.
20Pr 7:24 And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.
20Pr 7:25 Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,
20Pr 7:26 for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.
20Pr 7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
20Pr 8:1 Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice?
20Pr 8:2 On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;
20Pr 8:3 beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:
20Pr 8:4 "To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man.
20Pr 8:5 O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense.
20Pr 8:6 Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right,
20Pr 8:7 for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
20Pr 8:8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.
20Pr 8:9 They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.
20Pr 8:10 Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold,
20Pr 8:11 for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
20Pr 8:12 "I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
20Pr 8:13 The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
20Pr 8:14 I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength.
20Pr 8:15 By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;
20Pr 8:16 by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly.
20Pr 8:17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.
20Pr 8:18 Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.
20Pr 8:19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.
20Pr 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice,
20Pr 8:21 granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
20Pr 8:22 "The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old.
20Pr 8:23 Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
20Pr 8:24 When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.
20Pr 8:25 Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth,
20Pr 8:26 before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.
20Pr 8:27 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
20Pr 8:28 when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
20Pr 8:29 when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
20Pr 8:30 then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,
20Pr 8:31 rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man.
20Pr 8:32 "And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.
20Pr 8:33 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.
20Pr 8:34 Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
20Pr 8:35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD,
20Pr 8:36 but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death."
20Pr 9:1 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.
20Pr 9:2 She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
20Pr 9:3 She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town,
20Pr 9:4 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says,
20Pr 9:5 "Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.
20Pr 9:6 Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight."
20Pr 9:7 Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.
20Pr 9:8 Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
20Pr 9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
20Pr 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
20Pr 9:11 For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
20Pr 9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
20Pr 9:13 The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing.
20Pr 9:14 She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,
20Pr 9:15 calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,
20Pr 9:16 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says,
20Pr 9:17 "Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."
20Pr 9:18 But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

20Pr 10:2 Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death.

20Pr 10:10 Whoever winks the eye causes trouble, but a babbling fool will come to ruin.
20Pr 10:11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
20Pr 10:12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.
20Pr 10:13 On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.
20Pr 10:14 The wise lay up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near.
20Pr 10:15 A rich man's wealth is his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.
20Pr 10:16 The wage of the righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin.
20Pr 10:17 Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life, but he who rejects reproof leads others astray.
20Pr 10:18 The one who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever utters slander is a fool.
20Pr 10:19 When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent.
20Pr 10:20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the heart of the wicked is of little worth.
20Pr 10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of sense.
20Pr 10:22 The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.
20Pr 10:23 Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool, but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.
20Pr 10:24 What the wicked dreads will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
20Pr 10:25 When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more, but the righteous is established forever.
20Pr 10:26 Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.
20Pr 10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongs life, but the years of the wicked will be short.
20Pr 10:28 The hope of the righteous brings joy, but the expectation of the wicked will perish.
20Pr 10:29 The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the blameless, but destruction to evildoers.
20Pr 10:30 The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the land.
20Pr 10:31 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off.
20Pr 10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse.
20Pr 11:1 A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is his delight.
20Pr 11:2 When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.
20Pr 11:3 The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.
20Pr 11:4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.
20Pr 11:5 The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight, but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.
20Pr 11:6 The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.
20Pr 11:7 When the wicked dies, his hope will perish, and the expectation of wealth perishes too.
20Pr 11:8 The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead.
20Pr 11:9 With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.

20Pr 11:12 Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains silent.
20Pr 11:13 Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered.
20Pr 11:14 Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.
20Pr 11:15 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm, but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure.
20Pr 11:16 A gracious woman gets honor, and violent men get riches.
20Pr 11:17 A man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself.
20Pr 11:18 The wicked earns deceptive wages, but one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward.
20Pr 11:19 Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live, but he who pursues evil will die.
20Pr 11:20 Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the LORD, but those of blameless ways are his delight.
20Pr 11:21 Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.
20Pr 11:22 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.
20Pr 11:23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good; the expectation of the wicked in wrath.

20Pr 26:20 For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.
20Pr 26:21 As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
20Pr 26:22 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.
20Pr 26:23 Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart.
20Pr 26:24 Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart;

20Pr 29:17 Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your heart.
20Pr 29:18 Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.
20Pr 29:19 By mere words a servant is not disciplined, for though he understands, he will not respond.
20Pr 29:20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
20Pr 29:21 Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir.
20Pr 29:22 A man of wrath stirs up strife, and one given to anger causes much transgression.
20Pr 29:23 One's pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.
20Pr 29:24 The partner of a thief hates his own life; he hears the curse, but discloses nothing.
20Pr 29:25 The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.
20Pr 29:26 Many seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that a man gets justice.
20Pr 29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked.
20Pr 30:1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man declares, I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out.
20Pr 30:2 Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.
20Pr 30:3 I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.
20Pr 30:4 Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know!
20Pr 30:5 Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
20Pr 30:6 Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.
20Pr 30:7 Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die:
20Pr 30:8 Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,
20Pr 30:9 lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.
20Pr 30:10 Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
20Pr 30:11 There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
20Pr 30:12 There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth.
20Pr 30:13 There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!
20Pr 30:14 There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.
20Pr 30:15 The leech has two daughters: Give and Give. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":
20Pr 30:16 Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough."
20Pr 30:17 The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.
20Pr 30:18 Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:
20Pr 30:19 the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin.
20Pr 30:20 This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wrong."
20Pr 30:21 Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:
20Pr 30:22 a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;
20Pr 30:23 an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.
20Pr 30:24 Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:
20Pr 30:25 the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;
20Pr 30:26 the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
20Pr 30:27 the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;
20Pr 30:28 the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.
20Pr 30:29 Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:
20Pr 30:30 the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;
20Pr 30:31 the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.
20Pr 30:32 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.
20Pr 30:33 For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.
20Pr 31:1 The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:
20Pr 31:2 What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows?
20Pr 31:3 Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.
20Pr 31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,
20Pr 31:5 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
20Pr 31:6 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;
20Pr 31:7 let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.
20Pr 31:8 Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.
20Pr 31:9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.
20Pr 31:10  An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.
20Pr 31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
20Pr 31:12 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.
20Pr 31:13 She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.
20Pr 31:14 She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.
20Pr 31:15 She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.
20Pr 31:16 She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
20Pr 31:17 She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.
20Pr 31:18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.
20Pr 31:19 She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
20Pr 31:20 She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.
20Pr 31:21 She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
20Pr 31:22 She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20Pr 31:23 Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.
20Pr 31:24 She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.
20Pr 31:25 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
20Pr 31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
20Pr 31:27 She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
20Pr 31:28 Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
20Pr 31:29 "Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all."
20Pr 31:30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
20Pr 31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.

21Ec 1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
21Ec 1:3 What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?
21Ec 1:4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
21Ec 1:5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.
21Ec 1:6 The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.
21Ec 1:7 All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.
21Ec 1:8 All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
21Ec 1:9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.
21Ec 1:10 Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has been already in the ages before us.
21Ec 1:11 There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.
21Ec 1:12 I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:13 And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
21Ec 1:14 I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 1:15 What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
21Ec 1:16 I said in my heart, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
21Ec 1:17 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.
21Ec 1:18 For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
21Ec 2:1 I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself." But behold, this also was vanity.
21Ec 2:2 I said of laughter, "It is mad," and of pleasure, "What use is it?"
21Ec 2:3 I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine--my heart still guiding me with wisdom--and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
21Ec 2:4 I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
21Ec 2:5 I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
21Ec 2:6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
21Ec 2:7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
21Ec 2:8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the children of man.
21Ec 2:9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.
21Ec 2:10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.
21Ec 2:11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
21Ec 2:12 So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.
21Ec 2:13 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.
21Ec 2:14 The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.
21Ec 2:15 Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?" And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
21Ec 2:16 For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!
21Ec 2:17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 2:18 I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me,
21Ec 2:19 and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
21Ec 2:20 So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,
21Ec 2:21 because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
21Ec 2:22 What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
21Ec 2:23 For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
21Ec 2:24 There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,
21Ec 2:25 for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
21Ec 2:26 For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 3:1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
21Ec 3:2 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
21Ec 3:3 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
21Ec 3:4 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
21Ec 3:5 a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
21Ec 3:6 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
21Ec 3:7 a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
21Ec 3:8 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
21Ec 3:9 What gain has the worker from his toil?
21Ec 3:10 I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
21Ec 3:11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
21Ec 3:12 I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;
21Ec 3:13 also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil--this is God's gift to man.
21Ec 3:14 I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.
21Ec 3:15 That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.
21Ec 3:16 Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
21Ec 3:17 I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.
21Ec 3:18 I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.
21Ec 3:19 For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.
21Ec 3:20 All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.
21Ec 3:21 Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?
21Ec 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him?
21Ec 4:1 Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.
21Ec 4:2 And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.
21Ec 4:3 But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
21Ec 4:4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 4:5 The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.
21Ec 4:6 Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
21Ec 4:7 Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
21Ec 4:8 one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, "For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is vanity and an unhappy business.
21Ec 4:9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
21Ec 4:10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
21Ec 4:11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?
21Ec 4:12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him--a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
21Ec 4:13 Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.
21Ec 4:14 For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.
21Ec 4:15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king's place.
21Ec 4:16 There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 5:1  Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
21Ec 5:2  Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.
21Ec 5:3 For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.
21Ec 5:4 When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.
21Ec 5:5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
21Ec 5:6 Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
21Ec 5:7 For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.
21Ec 5:8 If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
21Ec 5:9 But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.
21Ec 5:10 He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.
21Ec 5:11 When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
21Ec 5:12 Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.
21Ec 5:13 There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,
21Ec 5:14 and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
21Ec 5:15 As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.
21Ec 5:16 This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?
21Ec 5:17 Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.
21Ec 5:18 Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot.
21Ec 5:19 Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil--this is the gift of God.
21Ec 5:20 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
21Ec 6:1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:
21Ec 6:2 a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.
21Ec 6:3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
21Ec 6:4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
21Ec 6:5 Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he.
21Ec 6:6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good--do not all go to the one place?
21Ec 6:7 All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.
21Ec 6:8 For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
21Ec 6:9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
21Ec 6:10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.
21Ec 6:11 The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?
21Ec 6:12 For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?
21Ec 7:1 A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth.
21Ec 7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart.
21Ec 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.
21Ec 7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
21Ec 7:5 It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
21Ec 7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fools; this also is vanity.
21Ec 7:7 Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21Ec 7:8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
21Ec 7:9 Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools.
21Ec 7:10 Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.
21Ec 7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.
21Ec 7:12 For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
21Ec 7:13 Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?
21Ec 7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.
21Ec 7:15 In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.
21Ec 7:16 Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
21Ec 7:17 Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
21Ec 7:18 It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.
21Ec 7:19 Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
21Ec 7:20 Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
21Ec 7:21 Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you.
21Ec 7:22 Your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.
21Ec 7:23 All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.
21Ec 7:24 That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?
21Ec 7:25 I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.
21Ec 7:26 And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.
21Ec 7:27 Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things--
21Ec 7:28 which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
21Ec 7:29 See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.
21Ec 8:1 Who is like the wise? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.
21Ec 8:2 I say: Keep the king's command, because of God's oath to him.
21Ec 8:3 Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.
21Ec 8:4 For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, "What are you doing?"
21Ec 8:5 Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way.
21Ec 8:6 For there is a time and a way for everything, although man's trouble lies heavy on him.
21Ec 8:7 For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be?
21Ec 8:8 No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.
21Ec 8:9 All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.
21Ec 8:10 Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.
21Ec 8:11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.
21Ec 8:12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.
21Ec 8:13 But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.
21Ec 8:14 There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
21Ec 8:15 And I commend joy, for man has no good thing under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.
21Ec 8:16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,
21Ec 8:17 then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.
21Ec 9:1 But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.
21Ec 9:2 It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.
21Ec 9:3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
21Ec 9:4 But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
21Ec 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.
21Ec 9:6 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.
21Ec 9:7 Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.
21Ec 9:8 Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.
21Ec 9:9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.
21Ec 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
21Ec 9:11 Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.
21Ec 9:12 For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.
21Ec 9:13 I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
21Ec 9:14 There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.
21Ec 9:15 But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
21Ec 9:16 But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.
21Ec 9:17 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
21Ec 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
21Ec 10:1 Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
21Ec 10:2 A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.
21Ec 10:3 Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
21Ec 10:4 If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.
21Ec 10:5 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:
21Ec 10:6 folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
21Ec 10:7 I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
21Ec 10:8 He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.
21Ec 10:9 He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them.
21Ec 10:10 If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed.
21Ec 10:11 If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.
21Ec 10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.
21Ec 10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness.
21Ec 10:14 A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?
21Ec 10:15 The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.
21Ec 10:16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!
21Ec 10:17 Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
21Ec 10:18 Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.
21Ec 10:19 Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.
21Ec 10:20 Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.
21Ec 11:1 Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.
21Ec 11:2 Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.
21Ec 11:3 If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
21Ec 11:4 He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.
21Ec 11:5 As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
21Ec 11:6 In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
21Ec 11:7 Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
21Ec 11:8 So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity.
21Ec 11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
21Ec 11:10 Remove vexation from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
21Ec 12:1 Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them";
21Ec 12:2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,
21Ec 12:3 in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are dimmed,
21Ec 12:4 and the doors on the street are shut--when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low--
21Ec 12:5 they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets--
21Ec 12:6 before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
21Ec 12:7 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
21Ec 12:8 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.
21Ec 12:9 Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care.
21Ec 12:10 The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
21Ec 12:11 The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd.
21Ec 12:12 My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
21Ec 12:13 The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
21Ec 12:14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

22Sg 1:1 The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
22Sg 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine;
22Sg 1:3 your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you.
22Sg 1:4 Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.
22Sg 1:5 I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
22Sg 1:6 Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?
22Sg 1:8 If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
22Sg 1:9 I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22Sg 1:10 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
22Sg 1:11 We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver.
22Sg 1:12 While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance.
22Sg 1:13 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts.
22Sg 1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi.
22Sg 1:15 Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
22Sg 1:16 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green;
22Sg 1:17 the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.
22Sg 2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
22Sg 2:2 As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women.
22Sg 2:3 As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
22Sg 2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
22Sg 2:5 Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love.
22Sg 2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!
22Sg 2:7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
22Sg 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22Sg 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice.
22Sg 2:10 My beloved speaks and says to me: "Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away,
22Sg 2:11 for behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.
22Sg 2:12 The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
22Sg 2:13 The fig tree ripens its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
22Sg 2:14 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22Sg 2:15 Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom."
22Sg 2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.
22Sg 2:17 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on cleft mountains.
22Sg 3:1 On my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not.
22Sg 3:2 I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but found him not.
22Sg 3:3 The watchmen found me as they went about in the city. "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"
22Sg 3:4 Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me.
22Sg 3:5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
22Sg 3:6 What is that coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of a merchant?
22Sg 3:7 Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men, some of the mighty men of Israel,
22Sg 3:8 all of them wearing swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against terror by night.
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon.
22Sg 3:10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
22Sg 3:11 Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.
22Sg 4:1 Behold, you are beautiful, my love, behold, you are beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead.
22Sg 4:2 Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them has lost its young.
22Sg 4:3 Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
22Sg 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built in rows of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
22Sg 4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that graze among the lilies.
22Sg 4:6 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
22Sg 4:7 You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.
22Sg 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
22Sg 4:9 You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22Sg 4:10 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!
22Sg 4:11 Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22Sg 4:12 A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.
22Sg 4:13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,
22Sg 4:14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all choice spices--
22Sg 4:15 a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
22Sg 4:16 Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.
22Sg 5:1 I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!
22Sg 5:2 I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."
22Sg 5:3 I had put off my garment; how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?
22Sg 5:4 My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me.
22Sg 5:5 I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.
22Sg 5:6 I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.
22Sg 5:7 The watchmen found me as they went about in the city; they beat me, they bruised me, they took away my veil, those watchmen of the walls.
22Sg 5:8 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love.
22Sg 5:9 What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?
22Sg 5:10 My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
22Sg 5:11 His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.
22Sg 5:12 His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, sitting beside a full pool.
22Sg 5:13 His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. His lips are lilies, dripping liquid myrrh.
22Sg 5:14 His arms are rods of gold, set with jewels. His body is polished ivory, bedecked with sapphires.
22Sg 5:15 His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
22Sg 5:16 His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
22Sg 6:1 Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
22Sg 6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies.
22Sg 6:3 I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.
22Sg 6:4 You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.
22Sg 6:5 Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me-- Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead.
22Sg 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young.
22Sg 6:7 Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
22Sg 6:8 There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
22Sg 6:9 My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.
22Sg 6:10 "Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?"
22Sg 6:11 I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
22Sg 6:12 Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince.
22Sg 6:13  Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?
22Sg 7:1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.
22Sg 7:2 Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.
22Sg 7:3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22Sg 7:4 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.
22Sg 7:5 Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.
22Sg 7:6 How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights!
22Sg 7:7 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.
22Sg 7:8 I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,
22Sg 7:9 and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.
22Sg 7:10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.
22Sg 7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages;
22Sg 7:12 let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
22Sg 7:13 The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
22Sg 8:1 Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me.
22Sg 8:2 I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother-- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.
22Sg 8:3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!
22Sg 8:4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
22Sg 8:5 Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.
22Sg 8:6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.
22Sg 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised.
22Sg 8:8 We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?
22Sg 8:9 If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
22Sg 8:10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace.
22Sg 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
22Sg 8:12 My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.
22Sg 8:13 O you who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice; let me hear it.
22Sg 8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.

23Is 1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23Is 1:2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: "Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.
23Is 1:3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."
23Is 1:4 Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.
23Is 1:5 Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
23Is 1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil.
23Is 1:7 Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.
23Is 1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
23Is 1:9 If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.
23Is 1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23Is 1:11 "What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
23Is 1:12 "When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts?
23Is 1:13 Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations-- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
23Is 1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
23Is 1:15 When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.
23Is 1:16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,
23Is 1:17 learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.
23Is 1:18 "Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
23Is 1:19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;
23Is 1:20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
23Is 1:21 How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
23Is 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water.
23Is 1:23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.
23Is 1:24 Therefore the Lord declares, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will get relief from my enemies and avenge myself on my foes.
23Is 1:25 I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.
23Is 1:26 And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."
23Is 1:27 Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
23Is 1:28 But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
23Is 1:29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.
23Is 1:30 For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.
23Is 1:31 And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.
23Is 2:1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
23Is 2:2 It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,
23Is 2:3 and many peoples shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23Is 2:4 He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
23Is 2:5 O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
23Is 2:6 For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
23Is 2:7 Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.
23Is 2:8 Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
23Is 2:9 So man is humbled, and each one is brought low-- do not forgive them!
23Is 2:10 Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty.
23Is 2:11 The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23Is 2:12 For the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up--and it shall be brought low;
23Is 2:13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
23Is 2:14 against all the lofty mountains, and against all the uplifted hills;
23Is 2:15 against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
23Is 2:16 against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
23Is 2:17 And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23Is 2:18 And the idols shall utterly pass away.
23Is 2:19 And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
23Is 2:20 In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,
23Is 2:21 to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
23Is 2:22 Stop regarding man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?
23Is 3:1 For behold, the Lord GOD of hosts is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply, all support of bread, and all support of water;
23Is 3:2 the mighty man and the soldier, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,
23Is 3:3 the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms.
23Is 3:4 And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.
23Is 3:5 And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable.
23Is 3:6 For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule";
23Is 3:7 in that day he will speak out, saying: "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people."
23Is 3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
23Is 3:9 For the look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
23Is 3:10 Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
23Is 3:11 Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him.
23Is 3:12 My people--infants are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your guides mislead you and they have swallowed up the course of your paths.
23Is 3:13 The LORD has taken his place to contend; he stands to judge peoples.
23Is 3:14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: "It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
23Is 3:15 What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?" declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
23Is 3:16 The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet,
23Is 3:17 therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.
23Is 3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
23Is 3:19 the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves;
23Is 3:20 the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
23Is 3:21 the signet rings and nose rings;
23Is 3:22 the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
23Is 3:23 the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
23Is 3:24 Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a skirt of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
23Is 3:25 Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle.
23Is 3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; empty, she shall sit on the ground.
23Is 4:1 And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach."
23Is 4:2 In that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel.
23Is 4:3 And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
23Is 4:4 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
23Is 4:5 Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy.
23Is 4:6 There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.
23Is 5:1 Let me sing for my beloved my love song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
23Is 5:2 He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.
23Is 5:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
23Is 5:4 What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?
23Is 5:5 And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.
23Is 5:6 I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
23Is 5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, an outcry!
23Is 5:8 Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.
23Is 5:9 The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: "Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
23Is 5:10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah."
23Is 5:11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!
23Is 5:12 They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work of his hands.
23Is 5:13 Therefore my people go into exile for lack of knowledge; their honored men go hungry, and their multitude is parched with thirst.
23Is 5:14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down, her revelers and he who exults in her.
23Is 5:15 Man is humbled, and each one is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.
23Is 5:16 But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.
23Is 5:17 Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture, and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.
23Is 5:18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin as with cart ropes,
23Is 5:19 who say: "Let him be quick, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near, and let it come, that we may know it!"
23Is 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
23Is 5:21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!
23Is 5:22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,
23Is 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!
23Is 5:24 Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 5:25 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23Is 5:26 He will raise a signal for nations far away, and whistle for them from the ends of the earth; and behold, quickly, speedily they come!
23Is 5:27 None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistband is loose, not a sandal strap broken;
23Is 5:28 their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.
23Is 5:29 Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey; they carry it off, and none can rescue.
23Is 5:30 They will growl over it on that day, like the growling of the sea. And if one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by its clouds.
23Is 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.
23Is 6:2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
23Is 6:3 And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!"
23Is 6:4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
23Is 6:5 And I said: "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"
23Is 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
23Is 6:7 And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for."
23Is 6:8 And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me."
23Is 6:9 And he said, "Go, and say to this people: "'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'
23Is 6:10 Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
23Is 6:11 Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste,
23Is 6:12 and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
23Is 6:13 And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.
23Is 7:1 In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.
23Is 7:2 When the house of David was told, "Syria is in league with Ephraim," the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
23Is 7:3 And the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
23Is 7:4 And say to him, 'Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.
23Is 7:5 Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,
23Is 7:6 "Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,"
23Is 7:7 thus says the Lord GOD: "'It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
23Is 7:8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.
23Is 7:9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all.'"
23Is 7:10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,
23Is 7:11 "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."
23Is 7:12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test."
23Is 7:13 And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?
23Is 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
23Is 7:15 He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
23Is 7:16 For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted.
23Is 7:17 The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--the king of Assyria."
23Is 7:18 In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
23Is 7:19 And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.
23Is 7:20 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River--with the king of Assyria--the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
23Is 7:21 In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
23Is 7:22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.
23Is 7:23 In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.
23Is 7:24 With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.
23Is 7:25 And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
23Is 8:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, 'Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.'
23Is 8:2 And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me."
23Is 8:3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
23Is 8:4 for before the boy knows how to cry 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria."
23Is 8:5 The LORD spoke to me again:
23Is 8:6 "Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
23Is 8:7 therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,
23Is 8:8 and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel."
23Is 8:9 Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered; give ear, all you far countries; strap on your armor and be shattered; strap on your armor and be shattered.
23Is 8:10 Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
23Is 8:11 For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:
23Is 8:12 "Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
23Is 8:13 But the LORD of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
23Is 8:14 And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
23Is 8:15 And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken."
23Is 8:16 Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples.
23Is 8:17 I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
23Is 8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23Is 8:19 And when they say to you, "Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter," should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?
23Is 8:20 To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.
23Is 8:21 They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.
23Is 8:22 And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.
23Is 9:1  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
23Is 9:2  The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined.
23Is 9:3 You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil.
23Is 9:4 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
23Is 9:5 For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.
23Is 9:6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
23Is 9:7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
23Is 9:8 The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will fall on Israel;
23Is 9:9 and all the people will know, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:
23Is 9:10 "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place."
23Is 9:11 But the LORD raises the adversaries of Rezin against him, and stirs up his enemies.
23Is 9:12 The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23Is 9:13 The people did not turn to him who struck them, nor inquire of the LORD of hosts.
23Is 9:14 So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day--
23Is 9:15 the elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;
23Is 9:16 for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
23Is 9:17 Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23Is 9:18 For wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
23Is 9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is scorched, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no one spares another.
23Is 9:20 They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; each devours the flesh of his own arm,
23Is 9:21 Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh; together they are against Judah. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23Is 10:1 Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression,
23Is 10:2 to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
23Is 10:3 What will you do on the day of punishment, in the ruin that will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?
23Is 10:4 Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23Is 10:5 Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury!
23Is 10:6 Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
23Is 10:7 But he does not so intend, and his heart does not so think; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few;
23Is 10:8 for he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?
23Is 10:9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
23Is 10:10 As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
23Is 10:11 shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her images?"
23Is 10:12 When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.
23Is 10:13 For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I remove the boundaries of peoples, and plunder their treasures; like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.
23Is 10:14 My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing or opened the mouth or chirped."
23Is 10:15 Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!
23Is 10:16 Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.
23Is 10:17 The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
23Is 10:18 The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
23Is 10:19 The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.
23Is 10:20 In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
23Is 10:21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
23Is 10:22 For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
23Is 10:23 For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.
23Is 10:24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: "O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.
23Is 10:25 For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.
23Is 10:26 And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
23Is 10:27 And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat."
23Is 10:28 He has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he stores his baggage;

23Is 14:5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of rulers,

23Is 14:18 All the kings of the nations lie in glory, each in his own tomb;
23Is 14:19 but you are cast out, away from your grave, like a loathed branch, clothed with the slain, those pierced by the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit, like a dead body trampled underfoot.
23Is 14:20 You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people. "May the offspring of evildoers nevermore be named!
23Is 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of their fathers, lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities."

23Is 14:32 What will one answer the messengers of the nation? "The LORD has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge."
23Is 15:1 An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone; because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone.
23Is 15:2 He has gone up to the temple, and to Dibon, to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. On every head is baldness; every beard is shorn;
23Is 15:3 in the streets they wear sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears.
23Is 15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles.

23Is 15:6 the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the vegetation fails, the greenery is no more.
23Is 15:7 Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Brook of the Willows.
23Is 15:8 For a cry has gone around the land of Moab; her wailing reaches to Eglaim; her wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
23Is 15:9 For the waters of Dibon are full of blood; for I will bring upon Dibon even more, a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land.

23Is 16:3 "Give counsel; grant justice; make your shade like night at the height of noon; shelter the outcasts; do not reveal the fugitive;
23Is 16:4 let the outcasts of Moab sojourn among you; be a shelter to them from the destroyer. When the oppressor is no more, and destruction has ceased, and he who tramples underfoot has vanished from the land,
23Is 16:5 then a throne will be established in steadfast love, and on it will sit in faithfulness in the tent of David one who judges and seeks justice and is swift to do righteousness."
23Is 16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab-- how proud he is!-- of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence; in his idle boasting he is not right.

23Is 16:8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have struck down its branches, which reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert; its shoots spread abroad and passed over the sea.
23Is 16:9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for over your summer fruit and your harvest the shout has ceased.
23Is 16:10 And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field, and in the vineyards no songs are sung, no cheers are raised; no treader treads out wine in the presses; I have put an end to the shouting.
23Is 16:11 Therefore my inner parts moan like a lyre for Moab, and my inmost self for Kir-hareseth.
23Is 16:12 And when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
23Is 16:13 This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past.
23Is 16:14 But now the LORD has spoken, saying, "In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all his great multitude, and those who remain will be very few and feeble."

23Is 17:7 In that day man will look to his Maker, and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 17:8 He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, and he will not look on what his own fingers have made, either the Asherim or the altars of incense.
23Is 17:9 In that day their strong cities will be like the deserted places of the wooded heights and the hilltops, which they deserted because of the children of Israel, and there will be desolation.
23Is 17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge; therefore, though you plant pleasant plants and sow the vine-branch of a stranger,

23Is 18:1 Ah, land of whirring wings that is beyond the rivers of Cush,
23Is 18:2 which sends ambassadors by the sea, in vessels of papyrus on the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation, tall and smooth, to a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide.
23Is 18:3 All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet is blown, hear!
23Is 18:4 For thus the LORD said to me: "I will quietly look from my dwelling like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
23Is 18:5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches he lops off and clears away.
23Is 18:6 They shall all of them be left to the birds of prey of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth. And the birds of prey will summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.
23Is 18:7 At that time tribute will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people tall and smooth, from a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide, to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD of hosts.

23Is 19:2 And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, each against another and each against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
23Is 19:3 and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out, and I will confound their counsel; and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers, and the mediums and the necromancers;
23Is 19:4 and I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master, and a fierce king will rule over them, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
23Is 19:5 And the waters of the sea will be dried up, and the river will be dry and parched,
23Is 19:6 and its canals will become foul, and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up, reeds and rushes will rot away.

23Is 19:10 Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed, and all who work for pay will be grieved.
23Is 19:11 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"?
23Is 19:12 Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you that they might know what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
23Is 19:13 The princes of Zoan have become fools, and the princes of Memphis are deluded; those who are the cornerstones of her tribes have made Egypt stagger.
23Is 19:14 The LORD has mingled within her a spirit of confusion, and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
23Is 19:15 And there will be nothing for Egypt that head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.
23Is 19:16 In that day the Egyptians will be like women, and tremble with fear before the hand that the LORD of hosts shakes over them.
23Is 19:17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts has purposed against them.
23Is 19:18 In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction.
23Is 19:19 In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.
23Is 19:20 It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the LORD because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them.
23Is 19:21 And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.

23Is 19:25 whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance."
23Is 20:1 In the year that the commander in chief, who was sent by Sargon the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against it and captured it--
23Is 20:2 at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go, and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet," and he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
23Is 20:3 Then the LORD said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush,
23Is 20:4 so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.

23Is 20:6 And the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, this is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and to whom we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And we, how shall we escape?'"

23Is 21:2 A stern vision is told to me; the traitor betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam; lay siege, O Media; all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.
23Is 21:3 Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labor; I am bowed down so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
23Is 21:4 My heart staggers; horror has appalled me; the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
23Is 21:5 They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Arise, O princes; oil the shield!
23Is 21:6 For thus the Lord said to me: "Go, set a watchman; let him announce what he sees.
23Is 21:7 When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him listen diligently, very diligently."
23Is 21:8 Then he who saw cried out: "Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed whole nights.
23Is 21:9 And behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!" And he answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the carved images of her gods he has shattered to the ground."
23Is 21:10 O my threshed and winnowed one, what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you.
23Is 21:11 The oracle concerning Dumah. One is calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, what time of the night? Watchman, what time of the night?"
23Is 21:12 The watchman says: "Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again."

23Is 21:14 To the thirsty bring water; meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
23Is 21:15 For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the press of battle.

23Is 21:17 And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken."
23Is 22:1 The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What do you mean that you have gone up, all of you, to the housetops,
23Is 22:2 you who are full of shoutings, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain with the sword or dead in battle.
23Is 22:3 All your leaders have fled together; without the bow they were captured. All of you who were found were captured, though they had fled far away.
23Is 22:4 Therefore I said: "Look away from me; let me weep bitter tears; do not labor to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people."
23Is 22:5 For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a battering down of walls and a shouting to the mountains.
23Is 22:6 And Elam bore the quiver with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
23Is 22:7 Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.
23Is 22:8 He has taken away the covering of Judah. In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest,
23Is 22:9 and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many. You collected the waters of the lower pool,
23Is 22:10 and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
23Is 22:11 You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.
23Is 22:12 In that day the Lord GOD of hosts called for weeping and mourning, for baldness and wearing sackcloth;
23Is 22:13 and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
23Is 22:14 The LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears: "Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for you until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts.
23Is 22:15 Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him:
23Is 22:16 What have you to do here, and whom have you here, that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock?
23Is 22:17 Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. He will seize firm hold on you
23Is 22:18 and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be your glorious chariots, you shame of your master's house.
23Is 22:19 I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station.
23Is 22:20 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
23Is 22:21 and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
23Is 22:22 And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
23Is 22:23 And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house.
23Is 22:24 And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.
23Is 22:25 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."
23Is 23:1 The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor! From the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them.
23Is 23:2 Be still, O inhabitants of the coast; the merchants of Sidon, who cross the sea, have filled you.
23Is 23:3 And on many waters your revenue was the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile; you were the merchant of the nations.
23Is 23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying: "I have neither labored nor given birth, I have neither reared young men nor brought up young women."
23Is 23:5 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish over the report about Tyre.
23Is 23:6 Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coast!
23Is 23:7 Is this your exultant city whose origin is from days of old, whose feet carried her to settle far away?
23Is 23:8 Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
23Is 23:9 The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to defile the pompous pride of all glory, to dishonor all the honored of the earth.
23Is 23:10 Cross over your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint anymore.
23Is 23:11 He has stretched out his hand over the sea; he has shaken the kingdoms; the LORD has given command concerning Canaan to destroy its strongholds.
23Is 23:12 And he said: "You will no more exult, O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon; arise, cross over to Cyprus, even there you will have no rest."
23Is 23:13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans! This is the people that was not; Assyria destined it for wild beasts. They erected their siege towers, they stripped her palaces bare, they made her a ruin.
23Is 23:14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste.
23Is 23:15 In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
23Is 23:16 "Take a harp; go about the city, O forgotten prostitute! Make sweet melody; sing many songs, that you may be remembered."
23Is 23:17 At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23Is 23:18 Her merchandise and her wages will be holy to the LORD. It will not be stored or hoarded, but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who dwell before the LORD.
23Is 24:1 Behold, the LORD will empty the earth and make it desolate, and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
23Is 24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
23Is 24:3 The earth shall be utterly empty and utterly plundered; for the LORD has spoken this word.
23Is 24:4 The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and withers; the highest people of the earth languish.
23Is 24:5 The earth lies defiled under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.
23Is 24:6 Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched, and few men are left.
23Is 24:7 The wine mourns, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.
23Is 24:8 The mirth of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the jubilant has ceased, the mirth of the lyre is stilled.
23Is 24:9 No more do they drink wine with singing; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
23Is 24:10 The wasted city is broken down; every house is shut up so that none can enter.
23Is 24:11 There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine; all joy has grown dark; the gladness of the earth is banished.
23Is 24:12 Desolation is left in the city; the gates are battered into ruins.
23Is 24:13 For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is done.
23Is 24:14 They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; over the majesty of the LORD they shout from the west.
23Is 24:15 Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea, give glory to the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23Is 24:16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, "I waste away, I waste away. Woe is me! For the traitors have betrayed, with betrayal the traitors have betrayed."
23Is 24:17 Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
23Is 24:18 He who flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
23Is 24:19 The earth is utterly broken, the earth is split apart, the earth is violently shaken.
23Is 24:20 The earth staggers like a drunken man; it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.
23Is 24:21 On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on the earth.
23Is 24:22 They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.
23Is 24:23 Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, for the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and his glory will be before his elders.
23Is 25:1 O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
23Is 25:2 For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; the foreigners' palace is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
23Is 25:3 Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; cities of ruthless nations will fear you.
23Is 25:4 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat; for the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall,
23Is 25:5 like heat in a dry place. You subdue the noise of the foreigners; as heat by the shade of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is put down.
23Is 25:6 On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined.
23Is 25:7 And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations.
23Is 25:8 He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.
23Is 25:9 It will be said on that day, "Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the LORD; we have waited for him; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation."
23Is 25:10 For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled down in his place, as straw is trampled down in a dunghill.
23Is 25:11 And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim, but the LORD will lay low his pompous pride together with the skill of his hands.
23Is 25:12 And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust.
23Is 26:1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; he sets up salvation as walls and bulwarks.
23Is 26:2 Open the gates, that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.
23Is 26:3 You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.
23Is 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.
23Is 26:5 For he has humbled the inhabitants of the height, the lofty city. He lays it low, lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.
23Is 26:6 The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy."
23Is 26:7 The path of the righteous is level; you make level the way of the righteous.
23Is 26:8 In the path of your judgments, O LORD, we wait for you; your name and remembrance are the desire of our soul.
23Is 26:9 My soul yearns for you in the night; my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
23Is 26:10 If favor is shown to the wicked, he does not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he deals corruptly and does not see the majesty of the LORD.
23Is 26:11 O LORD, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed. Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.
23Is 26:12 O LORD, you will ordain peace for us, for you have indeed done for us all our works.
23Is 26:13 O LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone we bring to remembrance.
23Is 26:14 They are dead, they will not live; they are shades, they will not arise; to that end you have visited them with destruction and wiped out all remembrance of them.
23Is 26:15 But you have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.
23Is 26:16 O LORD, in distress they sought you; they poured out a whispered prayer when your discipline was upon them.
23Is 26:17 Like a pregnant woman who writhes and cries out in her pangs when she is near to giving birth, so were we because of you, O LORD;
23Is 26:18 we were pregnant, we writhed, but we have given birth to wind. We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.
23Is 26:19 Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.
23Is 26:20 Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the fury has passed by.
23Is 26:21 For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no more cover its slain.
23Is 27:1 In that day the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.
23Is 27:2 In that day, "A pleasant vineyard, sing of it!
23Is 27:3 I, the LORD, am its keeper; every moment I water it. Lest anyone punish it, I keep it night and day;
23Is 27:4 I have no wrath. Would that I had thorns and briers to battle! I would march against them, I would burn them up together.
23Is 27:5 Or let them lay hold of my protection, let them make peace with me, let them make peace with me."
23Is 27:6 In days to come Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots and fill the whole world with fruit.
23Is 27:7 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or have they been slain as their slayers were slain?
23Is 27:8 Measure by measure, by exile you contended with them; he removed them with his fierce breath in the day of the east wind.
23Is 27:9 Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces, no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.
23Is 27:10 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; there the calf grazes; there it lies down and strips its branches.
23Is 27:11 When its boughs are dry, they are broken; women come and make a fire of them. For this is a people without discernment; therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them; he who formed them will show them no favor.
23Is 27:12 In that day from the river Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt the LORD will thresh out the grain, and you will be gleaned one by one, O people of Israel.
23Is 27:13 And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
23Is 28:1 Ah, the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!
23Is 28:2 Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters, he casts down to the earth with his hand.
23Is 28:3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot;
23Is 28:4 and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley, will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer: when someone sees it, he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand.
23Is 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people,
23Is 28:6 and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
23Is 28:7 These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed by wine, they stagger with strong drink, they reel in vision, they stumble in giving judgment.
23Is 28:8 For all tables are full of filthy vomit, with no space left.
23Is 28:9 "To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast?
23Is 28:10 For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little."
23Is 28:11 For by people of strange lips and with a foreign tongue the LORD will speak to this people,
23Is 28:12 to whom he has said, "This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose"; yet they would not hear.
23Is 28:13 And the word of the LORD will be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little, that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
23Is 28:14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, who rule this people in Jerusalem!
23Is 28:15 Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have an agreement, when the overwhelming whip passes through it will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter";
23Is 28:16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: 'Whoever believes will not be in haste.'
23Is 28:17 And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plumb line; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the shelter."
23Is 28:18 Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be beaten down by it.
23Is 28:19 As often as it passes through it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
23Is 28:20 For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.
23Is 28:21 For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim; as in the Valley of Gibeon he will be roused; to do his deed--strange is his deed! and to work his work--alien is his work!
23Is 28:22 Now therefore do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts against the whole land.
23Is 28:23 Give ear, and hear my voice; give attention, and hear my speech.
23Is 28:24 Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
23Is 28:25 When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, sow cumin, and put in wheat in rows and barley in its proper place, and emmer as the border?
23Is 28:26 For he is rightly instructed; his God teaches him.
23Is 28:27 Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin, but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
23Is 28:28 Does one crush grain for bread? No, he does not thresh it forever; when he drives his cart wheel over it with his horses, he does not crush it.
23Is 28:29 This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
23Is 29:1 Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts run their round.
23Is 29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and she shall be to me like an Ariel.
23Is 29:3 And I will encamp against you all around, and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you.
23Is 29:4 And you will be brought low; from the earth you shall speak, and from the dust your speech will be bowed down; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and from the dust your speech shall whisper.
23Is 29:5 But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,
23Is 29:6 you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
23Is 29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
23Is 29:8 As when a hungry man dreams he is eating and awakes with his hunger not satisfied, or as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
23Is 29:9 Astonish yourselves and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with strong drink!
23Is 29:10 For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes (the prophets), and covered your heads (the seers).
23Is 29:11 And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed."
23Is 29:12 And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot read."
23Is 29:13 And the Lord said: "Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,
23Is 29:14 therefore, behold, I will again do wonderful things with this people, with wonder upon wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden."
23Is 29:15 Ah, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
23Is 29:16 You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay, that the thing made should say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
23Is 29:17 Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?
23Is 29:18 In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
23Is 29:19 The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 29:20 For the ruthless shall come to nothing and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,
23Is 29:21 who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.
23Is 29:22 Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale.
23Is 29:23 For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23Is 29:24 And those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will accept instruction."
23Is 30:1 "Ah, stubborn children," declares the LORD, "who carry out a plan, but not mine, and who make an alliance, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin;
23Is 30:2 who set out to go down to Egypt, without asking for my direction, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
23Is 30:3 Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.
23Is 30:4 For though his officials are at Zoan and his envoys reach Hanes,
23Is 30:5 everyone comes to shame through a people that cannot profit them, that brings neither help nor profit, but shame and disgrace."
23Is 30:6 An oracle on the beasts of the Negeb. Through a land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the adder and the flying fiery serpent, they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.
23Is 30:7 Egypt's help is worthless and empty; therefore I have called her "Rahab who sits still."
23Is 30:8 And now, go, write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever.
23Is 30:9 For they are a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to hear the instruction of the LORD;
23Is 30:10 who say to the seers, "Do not see," and to the prophets, "Do not prophesy to us what is right; speak to us smooth things, prophesy illusions,
23Is 30:11 leave the way, turn aside from the path, let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
23Is 30:12 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and rely on them,
23Is 30:13 therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse, whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;
23Is 30:14 and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel that is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a shard is found with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern."
23Is 30:15 For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, "In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength." But you were unwilling,
23Is 30:16 and you said, "No! We will flee upon horses"; therefore you shall flee away; and, "We will ride upon swift steeds"; therefore your pursuers shall be swift.
23Is 30:17 A thousand shall flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you shall flee, till you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, like a signal on a hill.
23Is 30:18 Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.
23Is 30:19 For a people shall dwell in Zion, in Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you.
23Is 30:20 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.
23Is 30:21 And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
23Is 30:22 Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold-plated metal images. You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, "Be gone!"
23Is 30:23 And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures,
23Is 30:24 and the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
23Is 30:25 And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
23Is 30:26 Moreover, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when the LORD binds up the brokenness of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
23Is 30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD comes from afar, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; his lips are full of fury, and his tongue is like a devouring fire;
23Is 30:28 his breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck; to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray.
23Is 30:29 You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23Is 30:30 And the LORD will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and storm and hailstones.
23Is 30:31 The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, when he strikes with his rod.
23Is 30:32 And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on them will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. Battling with brandished arm, he will fight with them.
23Is 30:33 For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
23Is 31:1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult the LORD!
23Is 31:2 And yet he is wise and brings disaster; he does not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.
23Is 31:3 The Egyptians are man, and not God, and their horses are flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD stretches out his hand, the helper will stumble, and he who is helped will fall, and they will all perish together.
23Is 31:4 For thus the LORD said to me, "As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey, and when a band of shepherds is called out against him he is not terrified by their shouting or daunted at their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
23Is 31:5 Like birds hovering, so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it; he will spare and rescue it."
23Is 31:6 Turn to him from whom people have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
23Is 31:7 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
23Is 31:8 "And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
23Is 31:9 His rock shall pass away in terror, and his officers desert the standard in panic," declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23Is 32:1 Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule in justice.
23Is 32:2 Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
23Is 32:3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who hear will give attention.
23Is 32:4 The heart of the hasty will understand and know, and the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak distinctly.
23Is 32:5 The fool will no more be called noble, nor the scoundrel said to be honorable.
23Is 32:6 For the fool speaks folly, and his heart is busy with iniquity, to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
23Is 32:7 As for the scoundrel--his devices are evil; he plans wicked schemes to ruin the poor with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is right.
23Is 32:8 But he who is noble plans noble things, and on noble things he stands.
23Is 32:9 Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice; you complacent daughters, give ear to my speech.
23Is 32:10 In little more than a year you will shudder, you complacent women; for the grape harvest fails, the fruit harvest will not come.
23Is 32:11 Tremble, you women who are at ease, shudder, you complacent ones; strip, and make yourselves bare, and tie sackcloth around your waist.
23Is 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
23Is 32:13 for the soil of my people growing up in thorns and briers, yes, for all the joyous houses in the exultant city.
23Is 32:14 For the palace is forsaken, the populous city deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become dens forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
23Is 32:15 until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
23Is 32:16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
23Is 32:17 And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.
23Is 32:18 My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
23Is 32:19 And it will hail when the forest falls down, and the city will be utterly laid low.
23Is 32:20 Happy are you who sow beside all waters, who let the feet of the ox and the donkey range free.
23Is 33:1 Ah, you destroyer, who yourself have not been destroyed, you traitor, whom none has betrayed! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have finished betraying, they will betray you.
23Is 33:2 O LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for you. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.
23Is 33:3 At the tumultuous noise peoples flee; when you lift yourself up, nations are scattered,
23Is 33:4 and your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, it is leapt upon.
23Is 33:5 The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high; he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness,
23Is 33:6 and he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.
23Is 33:7 Behold, their heroes cry in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
23Is 33:8 The highways lie waste; the traveler ceases. Covenants are broken; cities are despised; there is no regard for man.
23Is 33:9 The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
23Is 33:10 "Now I will arise," says the LORD, "now I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.
23Is 33:11 You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.
23Is 33:12 And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire."
23Is 33:13 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.
23Is 33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: "Who among us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?"
23Is 33:15 He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed and shuts his eyes from looking on evil,
23Is 33:16 he will dwell on the heights; his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks; his bread will be given him; his water will be sure.
23Is 33:17 Your eyes will behold the king in his beauty; they will see a land that stretches afar.
23Is 33:18 Your heart will muse on the terror: "Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?"
23Is 33:19 You will see no more the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a tongue that you cannot understand.
23Is 33:20 Behold Zion, the city of our appointed feasts! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an untroubled habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.
23Is 33:21 But there the LORD in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor majestic ship can pass.
23Is 33:22 For the LORD is our judge; the LORD is our lawgiver; the LORD is our king; he will save us.
23Is 33:23 Your cords hang loose; they cannot hold the mast firm in its place or keep the sail spread out. Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will take the prey.
23Is 33:24 And no inhabitant will say, "I am sick"; the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
23Is 34:1 Draw near, O nations, to hear, and give attention, O peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it; the world, and all that comes from it.
23Is 34:2 For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, and furious against all their host; he has devoted them to destruction, has given them over for slaughter.
23Is 34:3 Their slain shall be cast out, and the stench of their corpses shall rise; the mountains shall flow with their blood.
23Is 34:4 All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall fall, as leaves fall from the vine, like leaves falling from the fig tree.
23Is 34:5 For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to destruction.
23Is 34:6 The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood; it is gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23Is 34:7 Wild oxen shall fall with them, and young steers with the mighty bulls. Their land shall drink its fill of blood, and their soil shall be gorged with fat.
23Is 34:8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
23Is 34:9 And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch.
23Is 34:10 Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.
23Is 34:11 But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it, the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.
23Is 34:12 Its nobles--there is no one there to call it a kingdom, and all its princes shall be nothing.
23Is 34:13 Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches.
23Is 34:14 And wild animals shall meet with hyenas; the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; indeed, there the night bird settles and finds for herself a resting place.
23Is 34:15 There the owl nests and lays and hatches and gathers her young in her shadow; indeed, there the hawks are gathered, each one with her mate.
23Is 34:16 Seek and read from the book of the LORD: Not one of these shall be missing; none shall be without her mate. For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, and his Spirit has gathered them.
23Is 34:17 He has cast the lot for them; his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; they shall possess it forever; from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
23Is 35:1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus;
23Is 35:2 it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.
23Is 35:3 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
23Is 35:4 Say to those who have an anxious heart, "Be strong; fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you."
23Is 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;
23Is 35:6 then shall the lame man leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute sing for joy. For waters break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;
23Is 35:7 the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; in the haunt of jackals, where they lie down, the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
23Is 35:8 And a highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Way of Holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it. It shall belong to those who walk on the way; even if they are fools, they shall not go astray.
23Is 35:9 No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.
23Is 35:10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
23Is 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
23Is 36:2 And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
23Is 36:3 And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
23Is 36:4 And the Rabshakeh said to them, "Say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?
23Is 36:5 Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?
23Is 36:6 Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
23Is 36:7 But if you say to me, "We trust in the LORD our God," is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You shall worship before this altar"?
23Is 36:8 Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
23Is 36:9 How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
23Is 36:10 Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.'"
23Is 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
23Is 36:12 But the Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?"
23Is 36:13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23Is 36:14 Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
23Is 36:15 Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
23Is 36:16 Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,
23Is 36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23Is 36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
23Is 36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
23Is 36:20 Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
23Is 36:21 But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
23Is 36:22 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
23Is 37:1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD.
23Is 37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
23Is 37:3 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
23Is 37:4 It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
23Is 37:5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
23Is 37:6 Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
23Is 37:7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.'"
23Is 37:8 The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
23Is 37:9 Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has set out to fight against you." And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
23Is 37:10 "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
23Is 37:11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?
23Is 37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
23Is 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"
23Is 37:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
23Is 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
23Is 37:16 "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
23Is 37:17 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
23Is 37:18 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
23Is 37:19 and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
23Is 37:20 So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD."
23Is 37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23Is 37:22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: "'She despises you, she scorns you-- the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you-- the daughter of Jerusalem.
23Is 37:23 "'Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23Is 37:24 By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon, to cut down its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses, to come to its remotest height, its most fruitful forest.
23Is 37:25 I dug wells and drank waters, to dry up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.
23Is 37:26 "'Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,
23Is 37:27 while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded, and have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.
23Is 37:28 "'I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
23Is 37:29 Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came.'
23Is 37:30 "And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
23Is 37:31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
23Is 37:32 For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
23Is 37:33 "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it.
23Is 37:34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD.
23Is 37:35 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
23Is 37:36 And the angel of the LORD went out and struck down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
23Is 37:37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
23Is 37:38 And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
23Is 38:1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover."
23Is 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
23Is 38:3 and said, "Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23Is 38:4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
23Is 38:5 "Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
23Is 38:6 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.
23Is 38:7 "This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised:
23Is 38:8 Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps." So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.
23Is 38:9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
23Is 38:10 I said, In the middle of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.
23Is 38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, the LORD in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
23Is 38:12 My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; like a weaver I have rolled up my life; he cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end;
23Is 38:13 I calmed myself until morning; like a lion he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23Is 38:14 Like a swallow or a crane I chirp; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my pledge of safety!
23Is 38:15 What shall I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
23Is 38:16 O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these is the life of my spirit. Oh restore me to health and make me live!
23Is 38:17 Behold, it was for my welfare that I had great bitterness; but in love you have delivered my life from the pit of destruction, for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
23Is 38:18 For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you; those who go down to the pit do not hope for your faithfulness.
23Is 38:19 The living, the living, he thanks you, as I do this day; the father makes known to the children your faithfulness.
23Is 38:20 The LORD will save me, and we will play my music on stringed instruments all the days of our lives, at the house of the LORD.
23Is 38:21 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover."
23Is 38:22 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
23Is 39:1 At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
23Is 39:2 And Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. And he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
23Is 39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, "What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?" Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."
23Is 39:4 He said, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them."
23Is 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
23Is 39:6 Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
23Is 39:7 And some of your own sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
23Is 39:8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my days."
23Is 40:1 Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
23Is 40:2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
23Is 40:3 A voice cries: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
23Is 40:4 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.
23Is 40:5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
23Is 40:6 A voice says, "Cry!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
23Is 40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it; surely the people are grass.
23Is 40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.
23Is 40:9 Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good news; lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Judah, "Behold your God!"
23Is 40:10 Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
23Is 40:11 He will tend his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms; he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.
23Is 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?
23Is 40:13 Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD, or what man shows him his counsel?
23Is 40:14 Whom did he consult, and who made him understand? Who taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?
23Is 40:15 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust.
23Is 40:16 Lebanon would not suffice for fuel, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
23Is 40:17 All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
23Is 40:18 To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?
23Is 40:19 An idol! A craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts for it silver chains.
23Is 40:20 He who is too impoverished for an offering chooses wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skillful craftsman to set up an idol that will not move.
23Is 40:21 Do you not know? Do you not hear? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
23Is 40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;
23Is 40:23 who brings princes to nothing, and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.
23Is 40:24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows on them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.
23Is 40:25 To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.
23Is 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing.
23Is 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God"?
23Is 40:28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.
23Is 40:29 He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.
23Is 40:30 Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted;
23Is 40:31 but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.
23Is 41:1 Listen to me in silence, O coastlands; let the peoples renew their strength; let them approach, then let them speak; let us together draw near for judgment.
23Is 41:2 Who stirred up one from the east whom victory meets at every step? He gives up nations before him, so that he tramples kings underfoot; he makes them like dust with his sword, like driven stubble with his bow.
23Is 41:3 He pursues them and passes on safely, by paths his feet have not trod.
23Is 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.
23Is 41:5 The coastlands have seen and are afraid; the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.
23Is 41:6 Everyone helps his neighbor and says to his brother, "Be strong!"
23Is 41:7 The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, "It is good"; and they strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved.
23Is 41:8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
23Is 41:9 you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, "You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off";
23Is 41:10 fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
23Is 41:11 Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.
23Is 41:12 You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.
23Is 41:13 For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, "Fear not, I am the one who helps you."
23Is 41:14 Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I am the one who helps you, declares the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:15 Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge, new, sharp, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff;
23Is 41:16 you shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in the LORD; in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.
23Is 41:17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the LORD will answer them; I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
23Is 41:18 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
23Is 41:19 I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive. I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane and the pine together,
23Is 41:20 that they may see and know, may consider and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23Is 41:21 Set forth your case, says the LORD; bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.
23Is 41:22 Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, that we may know their outcome; or declare to us the things to come.
23Is 41:23 Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be dismayed and terrified.
23Is 41:24 Behold, you are nothing, and your work is less than nothing; an abomination is he who chooses you.
23Is 41:25 I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun, and he shall call upon my name; he shall trample on rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay.
23Is 41:26 Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know, and beforehand, that we might say, "He is right"? There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed, none who heard your words.
23Is 41:27 I was the first to say to Zion, "Behold, here they are!" and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news.
23Is 41:28 But when I look, there is no one; among these there is no counselor who, when I ask, gives an answer.
23Is 41:29 Behold, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their metal images are empty wind.
23Is 42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
23Is 42:2 He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;
23Is 42:3 a bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.
23Is 42:4 He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law.
23Is 42:5 Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it:
23Is 42:6 "I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations,
23Is 42:7 to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.
23Is 42:8 I am the LORD; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.
23Is 42:9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them."
23Is 42:10 Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.
23Is 42:11 Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the habitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
23Is 42:12 Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.
23Is 42:13 The LORD goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes.
23Is 42:14 For a long time I have held my peace; I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant.
23Is 42:15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools.
23Is 42:16 And I will lead the blind in a way that they do not know, in paths that they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I do, and I do not forsake them.
23Is 42:17 They are turned back and utterly put to shame, who trust in carved idols, who say to metal images, "You are our gods."
23Is 42:18 Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see!
23Is 42:19 Who is blind but my servant, or deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as my dedicated one, or blind as the servant of the LORD?
23Is 42:20 He sees many things, but does not observe them; his ears are open, but he does not hear.
23Is 42:21 The LORD was pleased, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify his law and make it glorious.
23Is 42:22 But this is a people plundered and looted; they are all of them trapped in holes and hidden in prisons; they have become plunder with none to rescue, spoil with none to say, "Restore!"
23Is 42:23 Who among you will give ear to this, will attend and listen for the time to come?
23Is 42:24 Who gave up Jacob to the looter, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey?
23Is 42:25 So he poured on him the heat of his anger and the might of battle; it set him on fire all around, but he did not understand; it burned him up, but he did not take it to heart.
23Is 43:1 But now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.
23Is 43:2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.
23Is 43:3 For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in exchange for you.
23Is 43:4 Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.
23Is 43:5 Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you.
23Is 43:6 I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Do not withhold; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth,
23Is 43:7 everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
23Is 43:8 Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears!
23Is 43:9 All the nations gather together, and the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this, and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right, and let them hear and say, It is true.
23Is 43:10 "You are my witnesses," declares the LORD, "and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.
23Is 43:11 I, I am the LORD, and besides me there is no savior.
23Is 43:12 I declared and saved and proclaimed, when there was no strange god among you; and you are my witnesses," declares the LORD, "and I am God.
23Is 43:13 Also henceforth I am he; there is none who can deliver from my hand; I work, and who can turn it back?"
23Is 43:14 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "For your sake I send to Babylon and bring them all down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
23Is 43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King."
23Is 43:16 Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,
23Is 43:17 who brings forth chariot and horse, army and warrior; they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:
23Is 43:18 "Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old.
23Is 43:19 Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
23Is 43:20 The wild beasts will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches, for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people,
23Is 43:21 the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise.
23Is 43:22 "Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel!
23Is 43:23 You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings, or honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, or wearied you with frankincense.
23Is 43:24 You have not bought me sweet cane with money, or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins; you have wearied me with your iniquities.
23Is 43:25 "I, I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.
23Is 43:26 Put me in remembrance; let us argue together; set forth your case, that you may be proved right.
23Is 43:27 Your first father sinned, and your mediators transgressed against me.
23Is 43:28 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary, and deliver Jacob to utter destruction and Israel to reviling.
23Is 44:1 "But now hear, O Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen!
23Is 44:2 Thus says the LORD who made you, who formed you from the womb and will help you: Fear not, O Jacob my servant, Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
23Is 44:3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.
23Is 44:4 They shall spring up among the grass like willows by flowing streams.
23Is 44:5 This one will say, 'I am the LORD's,' another will call on the name of Jacob, and another will write on his hand, 'The LORD's,' and name himself by the name of Israel."
23Is 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.
23Is 44:7 Who is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and set it before me, since I appointed an ancient people. Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen.
23Is 44:8 Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? And you are my witnesses! Is there a God besides me? There is no Rock; I know not any."
23Is 44:9 All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit. Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame.
23Is 44:10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing?
23Is 44:11 Behold, all his companions shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand forth. They shall be terrified; they shall be put to shame together.
23Is 44:12 The ironsmith takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals. He fashions it with hammers and works it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water and is faint.
23Is 44:13 The carpenter stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass. He shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.
23Is 44:14 He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it.
23Is 44:15 Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it.
23Is 44:16 Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, "Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!"
23Is 44:17 And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, "Deliver me, for you are my god!"
23Is 44:18 They know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand.
23Is 44:19 No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, "Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?"
23Is 44:20 He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, "Is there not a lie in my right hand?"
23Is 44:21 Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant; I formed you; you are my servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
23Is 44:22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud and your sins like mist; return to me, for I have redeemed you.
23Is 44:23 Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it; shout, O depths of the earth; break forth into singing, O mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and will be glorified in Israel.
23Is 44:24 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: "I am the LORD, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,
23Is 44:25 who frustrates the signs of liars and makes fools of diviners, who turns wise men back and makes their knowledge foolish,
23Is 44:26 who confirms the word of his servant and fulfills the counsel of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, 'She shall be inhabited,' and of the cities of Judah, 'They shall be built, and I will raise up their ruins';
23Is 44:27 who says to the deep, 'Be dry; I will dry up your rivers';
23Is 44:28 who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose'; saying of Jerusalem, 'She shall be built,' and of the temple, 'Your foundation shall be laid.'"
23Is 45:1 Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to loose the belts of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed:
23Is 45:2 "I will go before you and level the exalted places, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron,
23Is 45:3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoards in secret places, that you may know that it is I, the LORD, the God of Israel, who call you by your name.
23Is 45:4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I name you, though you do not know me.
23Is 45:5 I am the LORD, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I equip you, though you do not know me,
23Is 45:6 that people may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:7 I form light and create darkness, I make well-being and create calamity, I am the LORD, who does all these things.
23Is 45:8 "Shower, O heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain down righteousness; let the earth open, that salvation and righteousness may bear fruit; let the earth cause them both to sprout; I the LORD have created it.
23Is 45:9 "Woe to him who strives with him who formed him, a pot among earthen pots! Does the clay say to him who forms it, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work has no handles'?
23Is 45:10 Woe to him who says to a father, 'What are you begetting?' or to a woman, 'With what are you in labor?'"
23Is 45:11 Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and the one who formed him: "Ask me of things to come; will you command me concerning my children and the work of my hands?
23Is 45:12 I made the earth and created man on it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.
23Is 45:13 I have stirred him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways level; he shall build my city and set my exiles free, not for price or reward," says the LORD of hosts.
23Is 45:14 Thus says the LORD: "The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you and be yours; they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will plead with you, saying: 'Surely God is in you, and there is no other, no god besides him.'"
23Is 45:15 Truly, you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
23Is 45:16 All of them are put to shame and confounded; the makers of idols go in confusion together.
23Is 45:17 But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.
23Is 45:18 For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it empty, he formed it to be inhabited!): "I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:19 I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek me in vain.' I the LORD speak the truth; I declare what is right.
23Is 45:20 "Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge who carry about their wooden idols, and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.
23Is 45:21 Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the LORD? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me.
23Is 45:22 "Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.
23Is 45:23 By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: 'To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.'
23Is 45:24 "Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him.
23Is 45:25 In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall be justified and shall glory."
23Is 46:1 Bel bows down; Nebo stoops; their idols are on beasts and livestock; these things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts.
23Is 46:2 They stoop; they bow down together; they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity.
23Is 46:3 "Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb;
23Is 46:4 even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save.
23Is 46:5 "To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?
23Is 46:6 Those who lavish gold from the purse, and weigh out silver in the scales, hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship!
23Is 46:7 They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries to it, it does not answer or save him from his trouble.
23Is 46:8 "Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors,
23Is 46:9 remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me,
23Is 46:10 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,'
23Is 46:11 calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.
23Is 46:12 "Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness:
23Is 46:13 I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory."
23Is 47:1 Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
23Is 47:2 Take the millstones and grind flour, put off your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.
23Is 47:3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your disgrace shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one.
23Is 47:4 Our Redeemer--the LORD of hosts is his name-- is the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 47:5 Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
23Is 47:6 I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand; you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.
23Is 47:7 You said, "I shall be mistress forever," so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.
23Is 47:8 Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children":
23Is 47:9 These two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.
23Is 47:10 You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, "No one sees me"; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me."
23Is 47:11 But evil shall come upon you, which you will not know how to charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, for which you will not be able to atone; and ruin shall come upon you suddenly, of which you know nothing.
23Is 47:12 Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed; perhaps you may inspire terror.
23Is 47:13 You are wearied with your many counsels; let them stand forth and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons make known what shall come upon you.
23Is 47:14 Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!
23Is 47:15 Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have done business with you from your youth; they wander about, each in his own direction; there is no one to save you.
23Is 48:1 Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.
23Is 48:2 For they call themselves after the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is his name.
23Is 48:3 "The former things I declared of old; they went out from my mouth, and I announced them; then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
23Is 48:4 Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass,
23Is 48:5 I declared them to you from of old, before they came to pass I announced them to you, lest you should say, 'My idol did them, my carved image and my metal image commanded them.'
23Is 48:6 "You have heard; now see all this; and will you not declare it? From this time forth I announce to you new things, hidden things that you have not known.
23Is 48:7 They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'
23Is 48:8 You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, and that from before birth you were called a rebel.
23Is 48:9 "For my name's sake I defer my anger, for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.
23Is 48:10 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
23Is 48:11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.
23Is 48:12 "Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.
23Is 48:13 My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together.
23Is 48:14 "Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
23Is 48:15 I, even I, have spoken and called him; I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
23Is 48:16 Draw near to me, hear this: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there." And now the Lord GOD has sent me, and his Spirit.
23Is 48:17 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you in the way you should go.
23Is 48:18 Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
23Is 48:19 your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me."
23Is 48:20 Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it out to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"
23Is 48:21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and the water gushed out.
23Is 48:22 "There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
23Is 49:1 Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.
23Is 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me away.
23Is 49:3 And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
23Is 49:4 But I said, "I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God."
23Is 49:5 And now the LORD says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him; and that Israel might be gathered to him-- for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength--
23Is 49:6 he says: "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel; I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."
23Is 49:7 Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation, the servant of rulers: "Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23Is 49:8 Thus says the LORD: "In a time of favor I have answered you; in a day of salvation I have helped you; I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages,
23Is 49:9 saying to the prisoners, 'Come out,' to those who are in darkness, 'Appear.' They shall feed along the ways; on all bare heights shall be their pasture;
23Is 49:10 they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.
23Is 49:11 And I will make all my mountains a road, and my highways shall be raised up.
23Is 49:12 Behold, these shall come from afar, and behold, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene."
23Is 49:13 Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people and will have compassion on his afflicted.
23Is 49:14 But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me."
23Is 49:15 "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
23Is 49:16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
23Is 49:17 Your builders make haste; your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you.
23Is 49:18 Lift up your eyes around and see; they all gather, they come to you. As I live, declares the LORD, you shall put them all on as an ornament; you shall bind them on as a bride does.
23Is 49:19 "Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land-- surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
23Is 49:20 The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears: 'The place is too narrow for me; make room for me to dwell in.'
23Is 49:21 Then you will say in your heart: 'Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren, exiled and put away, but who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; from where have these come?'"
23Is 49:22 Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
23Is 49:23 Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame."
23Is 49:24 Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
23Is 49:25 For thus says the LORD: "Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued, for I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.
23Is 49:26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
23Is 50:1 Thus says the LORD: "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce, with which I sent her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
23Is 50:2 Why, when I came, was there no man; why, when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.
23Is 50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering."
23Is 50:4 The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary. Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
23Is 50:5 The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious; I turned not backward.
23Is 50:6 I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.
23Is 50:7 But the Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.
23Is 50:8 He who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.
23Is 50:9 Behold, the Lord GOD helps me; who will declare me guilty? Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.
23Is 50:10 Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.
23Is 50:11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who equip yourselves with burning torches! Walk by the light of your fire, and by the torches that you have kindled! This you have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment.
23Is 51:1 "Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
23Is 51:2 Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he was but one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him.
23Is 51:3 For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.
23Is 51:4 "Give attention to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation; for a law will go out from me, and I will set my justice for a light to the peoples.
23Is 51:5 My righteousness draws near, my salvation has gone out, and my arms will judge the peoples; the coastlands hope for me, and for my arm they wait.
23Is 51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and they who dwell in it will die in like manner; but my salvation will be forever, and my righteousness will never be dismayed.
23Is 51:7 "Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.
23Is 51:8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations."
23Is 51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon?
23Is 51:10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
23Is 51:11 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
23Is 51:12 "I, I am he who comforts you; who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who is made like grass,
23Is 51:13 and have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and you fear continually all the day because of the wrath of the oppressor, when he sets himself to destroy? And where is the wrath of the oppressor?
23Is 51:14 He who is bowed down shall speedily be released; he shall not die and go down to the pit, neither shall his bread be lacking.
23Is 51:15 I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- the LORD of hosts is his name.
23Is 51:16 And I have put my words in your mouth and covered you in the shadow of my hand, establishing the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth, and saying to Zion, 'You are my people.'"
23Is 51:17 Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering.
23Is 51:18 There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is none to take her by the hand among all the sons she has brought up.
23Is 51:19 These two things have happened to you-- who will console you?-- devastation and destruction, famine and sword; who will comfort you?
23Is 51:20 Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
23Is 51:21 Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, who are drunk, but not with wine:
23Is 51:22 Thus says your Lord, the LORD, your God who pleads the cause of his people: "Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering; the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more;
23Is 51:23 and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who have said to you, 'Bow down, that we may pass over'; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over."
23Is 52:1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
23Is 52:2 Shake yourself from the dust and arise; be seated, O Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
23Is 52:3 For thus says the LORD: "You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money."
23Is 52:4 For thus says the Lord GOD: "My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.
23Is 52:5 Now therefore what have I here," declares the LORD, "seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail," declares the LORD, "and continually all the day my name is despised.
23Is 52:6 Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here am I."
23Is 52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns."
23Is 52:8 The voice of your watchmen--they lift up their voice; together they sing for joy; for eye to eye they see the return of the LORD to Zion.
23Is 52:9 Break forth together into singing, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23Is 52:10 The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
23Is 52:11 Depart, depart, go out from there; touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the LORD.
23Is 52:12 For you shall not go out in haste, and you shall not go in flight, for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23Is 52:13 Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted.
23Is 52:14 As many were astonished at you-- his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind--
23Is 52:15 so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.
23Is 53:1 Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
23Is 53:2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
23Is 53:3 He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
23Is 53:4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
23Is 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed.
23Is 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
23Is 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.
23Is 53:8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?
23Is 53:9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.
23Is 53:10 Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
23Is 53:11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.
23Is 53:12 Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.
23Is 54:1 "Sing, O barren one, who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her who is married," says the LORD.
23Is 54:2 "Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.
23Is 54:3 For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left, and your offspring will possess the nations and will people the desolate cities.
23Is 54:4 "Fear not, for you will not be ashamed; be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced; for you will forget the shame of your youth, and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
23Is 54:5 For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called.
23Is 54:6 For the LORD has called you like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when she is cast off, says your God.
23Is 54:7 For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you.
23Is 54:8 In overflowing anger for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you," says the LORD, your Redeemer.
23Is 54:9 "This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you.
23Is 54:10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed," says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
23Is 54:11 "O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
23Is 54:12 I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your wall of precious stones.
23Is 54:13 All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace of your children.
23Is 54:14 In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
23Is 54:15 If anyone stirs up strife, it is not from me; whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you.
23Is 54:16 Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its purpose. I have also created the ravager to destroy;
23Is 54:17 no weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall confute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their vindication from me, declares the LORD."
23Is 55:1 "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
23Is 55:2 Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.
23Is 55:3 Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David.
23Is 55:4 Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples.
23Is 55:5 Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you.
23Is 55:6 "Seek the LORD while he may be found; call upon him while he is near;
23Is 55:7 let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
23Is 55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.
23Is 55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23Is 55:10 "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
23Is 55:11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
23Is 55:12 "For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
23Is 55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; and it shall make a name for the LORD, an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."
23Is 56:1 Thus says the LORD: "Keep justice, and do righteousness, for soon my salvation will come, and my deliverance be revealed.
23Is 56:2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath, not profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil."
23Is 56:3 Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely separate me from his people"; and let not the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
23Is 56:4 For thus says the LORD: "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant,
23Is 56:5 I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
23Is 56:6 "And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant--
23Is 56:7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
23Is 56:8 The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares, "I will gather yet others to him besides those already gathered."
23Is 56:9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour-- all you beasts in the forest.
23Is 56:10 His watchmen are blind; they are all without knowledge; they are all silent dogs; they cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
23Is 56:11 The dogs have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. But they are shepherds who have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all.
23Is 56:12 "Come," they say, "let me get wine; let us fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be like this day, great beyond measure."
23Is 57:1 The righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;
23Is 57:2 he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.
23Is 57:3 But you, draw near, sons of the sorceress, offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman.
23Is 57:4 Whom are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit,
23Is 57:5 you who burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
23Is 57:6 Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they, are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a grain offering. Shall I relent for these things?
23Is 57:7 On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifice.
23Is 57:8 Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial; for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed, you have gone up to it, you have made it wide; and you have made a covenant for yourself with them, you have loved their bed, you have looked on nakedness.
23Is 57:9 You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far off, and sent down even to Sheol.
23Is 57:10 You were wearied with the length of your way, but you did not say, "It is hopeless"; you found new life for your strength, and so you were not faint.
23Is 57:11 Whom did you dread and fear, so that you lied, and did not remember me, did not lay it to heart? Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, and you do not fear me?
23Is 57:12 I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, but they will not profit you.
23Is 57:13 When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain.
23Is 57:14 And it shall be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people's way."
23Is 57:15 For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: "I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23Is 57:16 For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before me, and the breath of life that I made.
23Is 57:17 Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, I struck him; I hid my face and was angry, but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.
23Is 57:18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,
23Is 57:19 creating the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to the far and to the near," says the LORD, "and I will heal him.
23Is 57:20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea; for it cannot be quiet, and its waters toss up mire and dirt.
23Is 57:21 There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
23Is 58:1 "Cry aloud; do not hold back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins.
23Is 58:2 Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.
23Is 58:3 'Why have we fasted, and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?' Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.
23Is 58:4 Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.
23Is 58:5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the LORD?
23Is 58:6 "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
23Is 58:7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
23Is 58:8 Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
23Is 58:9 Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, 'Here I am.' If you take away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
23Is 58:10 if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.
23Is 58:11 And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
23Is 58:12 And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.
23Is 58:13 "If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;
23Is 58:14 then you shall take delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
23Is 59:1 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
23Is 59:2 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
23Is 59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies; your tongue mutters wickedness.
23Is 59:4 No one enters suit justly; no one goes to law honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
23Is 59:5 They hatch adders' eggs; they weave the spider's web; he who eats their eggs dies, and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched.
23Is 59:6 Their webs will not serve as clothing; men will not cover themselves with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands.
23Is 59:7 Their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their highways.
23Is 59:8 The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths; they have made their roads crooked; no one who treads on them knows peace.
23Is 59:9 Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold, darkness, and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
23Is 59:10 We grope for the wall like the blind; we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
23Is 59:11 We all growl like bears; we moan and moan like doves; we hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.
23Is 59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:
23Is 59:13 transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning back from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.
23Is 59:14 Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.
23Is 59:15 Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
23Is 59:16 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede; then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.
23Is 59:17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.
23Is 59:18 According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render repayment.
23Is 59:19 So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the LORD drives.
23Is 59:20 "And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression," declares the LORD.
23Is 59:21 "And as for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring," says the LORD, "from this time forth and forevermore."
23Is 60:1 Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
23Is 60:2 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.
23Is 60:3 And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.
23Is 60:4 Lift up your eyes all around, and see; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.
23Is 60:5 Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
23Is 60:6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.
23Is 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will beautify my beautiful house.
23Is 60:8 Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their windows?
23Is 60:9 For the coastlands shall hope for me, the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your children from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the name of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you beautiful.
23Is 60:10 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you; for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
23Is 60:11 Your gates shall be open continually; day and night they shall not be shut, that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations, with their kings led in procession.
23Is 60:12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
23Is 60:13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine, to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
23Is 60:14 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending low to you, and all who despised you shall bow down at your feet; they shall call you the City of the LORD, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 60:15 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age.
23Is 60:16 You shall suck the milk of nations; you shall nurse at the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23Is 60:17 Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; instead of wood, bronze, instead of stones, iron. I will make your overseers peace and your taskmasters righteousness.
23Is 60:18 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation or destruction within your borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
23Is 60:19 The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23Is 60:20 Your sun shall no more go down, nor your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.
23Is 60:21 Your people shall all be righteous; they shall possess the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I might be glorified.
23Is 60:22 The least one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will hasten it.
23Is 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
23Is 61:2 to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
23Is 61:3 to grant to those who mourn in Zion-- to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
23Is 61:4 They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
23Is 61:5 Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
23Is 61:6 but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.
23Is 61:7 Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.
23Is 61:8 For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
23Is 61:9 Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.
23Is 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23Is 61:11 For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations.
23Is 62:1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch.
23Is 62:2 The nations shall see your righteousness, and all the kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.
23Is 62:3 You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
23Is 62:4 You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.
23Is 62:5 For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.
23Is 62:6 On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put the LORD in remembrance, take no rest,
23Is 62:7 and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.
23Is 62:8 The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored;
23Is 62:9 but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."
23Is 62:10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway; clear it of stones; lift up a signal over the peoples.
23Is 62:11 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."
23Is 62:12 And they shall be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
23Is 63:1 Who is this who comes from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah, he who is splendid in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? "It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save."
23Is 63:2 Why is your apparel red, and your garments like his who treads in the winepress?
23Is 63:3 "I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered on my garments, and stained all my apparel.
23Is 63:4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and my year of redemption had come.
23Is 63:5 I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; so my own arm brought me salvation, and my wrath upheld me.
23Is 63:6 I trampled down the peoples in my anger; I made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
23Is 63:7 I will recount the steadfast love of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has granted us, and the great goodness to the house of Israel that he has granted them according to his compassion, according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
23Is 63:8 For he said, "Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely." And he became their Savior.
23Is 63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23Is 63:10 But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit; therefore he turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.
23Is 63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, of Moses and his people. Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put in the midst of them his Holy Spirit,
23Is 63:12 who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name,
23Is 63:13 who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble.
23Is 63:14 Like livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So you led your people, to make for yourself a glorious name.
23Is 63:15 Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and beautiful habitation. Where are your zeal and your might? The stirring of your inner parts and your compassion are held back from me.
23Is 63:16 For you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
23Is 63:17 O LORD, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our heart, so that we fear you not? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.
23Is 63:18 Your holy people held possession for a little while; our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.
23Is 63:19 We have become like those over whom you have never ruled, like those who are not called by your name.
23Is 64:1 Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence--
23Is 64:2  as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make your name known to your adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at your presence!
23Is 64:3 When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
23Is 64:4 From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.
23Is 64:5 You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?
23Is 64:6 We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
23Is 64:7 There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.
23Is 64:8 But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23Is 64:9 Be not so terribly angry, O LORD, and remember not iniquity forever. Behold, please look, we are all your people.
23Is 64:10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
23Is 64:11 Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
23Is 64:12 Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?
23Is 65:1 I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, "Here am I, here am I," to a nation that was not called by my name.
23Is 65:2 I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;
23Is 65:3 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and making offerings on bricks;
23Is 65:4 who sit in tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels;
23Is 65:5 who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you." These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.
23Is 65:6 Behold, it is written before me: "I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their bosom
23Is 65:7 both your iniquities and your fathers' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they made offerings on the mountains and insulted me on the hills, I will measure into their bosom payment for their former deeds."
23Is 65:8 Thus says the LORD: "As the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say, 'Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,' so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all.
23Is 65:9 I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and from Judah possessors of my mountains; my chosen shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there.
23Is 65:10 Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.
23Is 65:11 But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,
23Is 65:12 I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, because, when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my eyes and chose what I did not delight in."
23Is 65:13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;
23Is 65:14 behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart and shall wail for breaking of spirit.
23Is 65:15 You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse, and the Lord GOD will put you to death, but his servants he will call by another name.
23Is 65:16 So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my eyes.
23Is 65:17 "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.
23Is 65:18 But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness.
23Is 65:19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.
23Is 65:20 No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the young man shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
23Is 65:21 They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 65:22 They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
23Is 65:23 They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity, for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their descendants with them.
23Is 65:24 Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear.
23Is 65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain," says the LORD.
23Is 66:1 Thus says the LORD: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?
23Is 66:2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.
23Is 66:3 "He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;
23Is 66:4 I also will choose harsh treatment for them and bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my eyes and chose that in which I did not delight."
23Is 66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for my name's sake have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy'; but it is they who shall be put to shame.
23Is 66:6 "The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! The sound of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!
23Is 66:7 "Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son.
23Is 66:8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children.
23Is 66:9 Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?" says the LORD; "shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?" says your God.
23Is 66:10 "Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her;
23Is 66:11 that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance."
23Is 66:12 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.
23Is 66:13 As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
23Is 66:14 You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known to his servants, and he shall show his indignation against his enemies.
23Is 66:15 "For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
23Is 66:16 For by fire will the LORD enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.
23Is 66:17 "Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the LORD.
23Is 66:18 "For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,
23Is 66:19 and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
23Is 66:20 And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
23Is 66:21 And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.
23Is 66:22 "For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain.
23Is 66:23 From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD.
23Is 66:24 "And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."
