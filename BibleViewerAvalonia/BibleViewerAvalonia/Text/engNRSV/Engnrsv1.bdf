01â 1:1 In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
01â 1:2 the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
01â 1:3 Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
01â 1:4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
01â 1:5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
01â 1:6 And God said, "Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
01â 1:7 So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.
01â 1:8 God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
01â 1:9 And God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
01â 1:10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
01â 1:11 Then God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it." And it was so.
01â 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
01â 1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
01â 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,
01â 1:15 and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
01â 1:16 God made the two great lights--the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night--and the stars.
01â 1:17 God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,
01â 1:18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
01â 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
01â 1:20 And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky."
01â 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
01â 1:22 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
01â 1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
01â 1:24 And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind." And it was so.
01â 1:25 God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
01â 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."
01â 1:27 So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
01â 1:28 God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."
01â 1:29 God said, "See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
01â 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
01â 1:31 God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
01â 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
01â 2:2 And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
01â 2:3 So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
01â 2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
01â 2:5 when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
01â 2:6 but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground--
01â 2:7 then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
01â 2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
01â 2:9 Out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01â 2:10 A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
01â 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
01â 2:12 and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
01â 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.
01â 2:14 The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01â 2:15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.
01â 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
01â 2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."
01â 2:18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner."
01â 2:19 So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
01â 2:20 The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.
01â 2:21 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
01â 2:22 And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
01â 2:23 Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken."
01â 2:24 Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.
01â 2:25 And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.
01â 3:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
01â 3:2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
01â 3:3 but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.'"
01â 3:4 But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die;
01â 3:5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
01â 3:6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
01â 3:7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
01â 3:8 They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
01â 3:9 But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
01â 3:10 He said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
01â 3:11 He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
01â 3:12 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate."
01â 3:13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate."
01â 3:14 The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
01â 3:15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel."
01â 3:16 To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."
01â 3:17 And to the man he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
01â 3:18 thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
01â 3:19 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
01â 3:20 The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
01â 3:21 And the LORD God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.
01â 3:22 Then the LORD God said, "See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
01â 3:23 therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
01â 3:24 He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.
01â 4:1 Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."
01â 4:2 Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
01â 4:3 In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
01â 4:4 and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
01â 4:5 but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
01â 4:6 The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
01â 4:7 If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."
01â 4:8 Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
01â 4:9 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
01â 4:10 And the LORD said, "What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
01â 4:11 And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
01â 4:12 When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
01â 4:13 Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear!
01â 4:14 Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me."
01â 4:15 Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
01â 4:16 Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01â 4:17 Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
01â 4:18 To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
01â 4:19 Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
01â 4:20 Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
01â 4:21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
01â 4:22 Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
01â 4:23 Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
01â 4:24 If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
01â 4:25 Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him."
01â 4:26 To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.
01â 5:1 This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
01â 5:2 Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them "Humankind" when they were created.
01â 5:3 When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
01â 5:4 The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:5 Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.
01â 5:6 When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.
01â 5:7 Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:8 Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.
01â 5:9 When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
01â 5:10 Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:11 Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.
01â 5:12 When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
01â 5:13 Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:14 Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
01â 5:15 When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
01â 5:16 Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:17 Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.
01â 5:18 When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
01â 5:19 Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:20 Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.
01â 5:21 When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
01â 5:22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
01â 5:24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
01â 5:25 When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
01â 5:26 Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:27 Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.
01â 5:28 When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;
01â 5:29 he named him Noah, saying, "Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands."
01â 5:30 Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 5:31 Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
01â 5:32 After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01â 6:1 When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
01â 6:2 the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.
01â 6:3 Then the LORD said, "My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years."
01â 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
01â 6:5 The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.
01â 6:6 And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
01â 6:7 So the LORD said, "I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created--people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."
01â 6:8 But Noah found favor in the sight of the LORD.
01â 6:9 These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
01â 6:10 And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01â 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
01â 6:12 And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.
01â 6:13 And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
01â 6:14 Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
01â 6:15 This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
01â 6:16 Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.
01â 6:17 For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
01â 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
01â 6:19 And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
01â 6:20 Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.
01â 6:21 Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them."
01â 6:22 Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
01â 7:1 Then the LORD said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.
01â 7:2 Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;
01â 7:3 and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.
01â 7:4 For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."
01â 7:5 And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
01â 7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
01â 7:7 And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
01â 7:8 Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
01â 7:9 two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
01â 7:10 And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.
01â 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
01â 7:12 The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
01â 7:13 On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,
01â 7:14 they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind--every bird, every winged creature.
01â 7:15 They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
01â 7:16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
01â 7:17 The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
01â 7:18 The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
01â 7:19 The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;
01â 7:20 the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
01â 7:21 And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;
01â 7:22 everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
01â 7:23 He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
01â 7:24 And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.
01â 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;
01â 8:2 the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
01â 8:3 and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated;
01â 8:4 and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
01â 8:5 The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
01â 8:6 At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
01â 8:7 and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
01â 8:8 Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;
01â 8:9 but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.
01â 8:10 He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;
01â 8:11 and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
01â 8:12 Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.
01â 8:13 In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.
01â 8:14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
01â 8:15 Then God said to Noah,
01â 8:16 "Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
01â 8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh--birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth--so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
01â 8:18 So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
01â 8:19 And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.
01â 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
01â 8:21 And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
01â 8:22 As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."
01â 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
01â 9:2 The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
01â 9:3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
01â 9:4 Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
01â 9:5 For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.
01â 9:6 Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in his own image God made humankind.
01â 9:7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it."
01â 9:8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
01â 9:9 "As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
01â 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
01â 9:11 I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
01â 9:12 God said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
01â 9:13 I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
01â 9:14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
01â 9:15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
01â 9:16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
01â 9:17 God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
01â 9:18 The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
01â 9:19 These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
01â 9:20 Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
01â 9:21 He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent.
01â 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
01â 9:23 Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
01â 9:24 When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
01â 9:25 he said, "Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers."
01â 9:26 He also said, "Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.
01â 9:27 May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave."
01â 9:28 After the flood Noah lived three hundred fifty years.
01â 9:29 All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.
01â 10:1 These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; children were born to them after the flood.
01â 10:2 The descendants of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
01â 10:3 The descendants of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
01â 10:4 The descendants of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.
01â 10:5 From these the coastland peoples spread. These are the descendants of Japheth in their lands, with their own language, by their families, in their nations.
01â 10:6 The descendants of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
01â 10:7 The descendants of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
01â 10:8 Cush became the father of Nimrod; he was the first on earth to become a mighty warrior.
01â 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD."
01â 10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar.
01â 10:11 From that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, and
01â 10:12 Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
01â 10:13 Egypt became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
01â 10:14 Pathrusim, Casluhim, and Caphtorim, from which the Philistines come.
01â 10:15 Canaan became the father of Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
01â 10:16 and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
01â 10:17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
01â 10:18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
01â 10:19 And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon, in the direction of Gerar, as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01â 10:20 These are the descendants of Ham, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
01â 10:21 To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
01â 10:22 The descendants of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
01â 10:23 The descendants of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
01â 10:24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
01â 10:25 To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
01â 10:26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01â 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01â 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01â 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the descendants of Joktan.
01â 10:30 The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar, the hill country of the east.
01â 10:31 These are the descendants of Shem, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
01â 10:32 These are the families of Noah's sons, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
01â 11:1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
01â 11:2 And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
01â 11:3 And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
01â 11:4 Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
01â 11:5 The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built.
01â 11:6 And the LORD said, "Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
01â 11:7 Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
01â 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
01â 11:9 Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
01â 11:10 These are the descendants of Shem. When Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;
01â 11:11 and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:12 When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah;
01â 11:13 and Arpachshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:14 When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber;
01â 11:15 and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:16 When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg;
01â 11:17 and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:18 When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu;
01â 11:19 and Peleg lived after the birth of Reu two hundred nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:20 When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug;
01â 11:21 and Reu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:22 When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor;
01â 11:23 and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:24 When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah;
01â 11:25 and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah one hundred nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
01â 11:26 When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
01â 11:27 Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
01â 11:28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
01â 11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
01â 11:30 Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
01â 11:31 Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
01â 11:32 The days of Terah were two hundred five years; and Terah died in Haran.
01â 12:1 Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
01â 12:2 I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
01â 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
01â 12:4 So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
01â 12:5 Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother's son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan,
01â 12:6 Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01â 12:7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
01â 12:8 From there he moved on to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and invoked the name of the LORD.
01â 12:9 And Abram journeyed on by stages toward the Negeb.
01â 12:10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to reside there as an alien, for the famine was severe in the land.
01â 12:11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know well that you are a woman beautiful in appearance;
01â 12:12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife'; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
01â 12:13 Say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account."
01â 12:14 When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
01â 12:15 When the officials of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
01â 12:16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys, and camels.
01â 12:17 But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
01â 12:18 So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
01â 12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone."
01â 12:20 And Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.
01â 13:1 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
01â 13:2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
01â 13:3 He journeyed on by stages from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
01â 13:4 to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
01â 13:5 Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
01â 13:6 so that the land could not support both of them living together; for their possessions were so great that they could not live together,
01â 13:7 and there was strife between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land.
01â 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.
01â 13:9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."
01â 13:10 Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the LORD had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
01â 13:11 So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.
01â 13:12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
01â 13:13 Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
01â 13:14 The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
01â 13:15 for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
01â 13:16 I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
01â 13:17 Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."
01â 13:18 So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD.
01â 14:1 In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim,
01â 14:2 these kings made war with King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01â 14:3 All these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).
01â 14:4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01â 14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
01â 14:6 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness;
01â 14:7 then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
01â 14:8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
01â 14:9 with King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.
01â 14:10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
01â 14:11 So the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way;
01â 14:12 they also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
01â 14:13 Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner; these were allies of Abram.
01â 14:14 When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01â 14:15 He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
01â 14:16 Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his nephew Lot with his goods, and the women and the people.
01â 14:17 After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
01â 14:18 And King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of God Most High.
01â 14:19 He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, maker of heaven and earth;
01â 14:20 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him one tenth of everything.
01â 14:21 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."
01â 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn to the LORD, God Most High, maker of heaven and earth,
01â 14:23 that I would not take a thread or a sandal-thong or anything that is yours, so that you might not say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
01â 14:24 I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me--Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their share."
01â 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, "Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."
01â 15:2 But Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
01â 15:3 And Abram said, "You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir."
01â 15:4 But the word of the LORD came to him, "This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir."
01â 15:5 He brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
01â 15:6 And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.
01â 15:7 Then he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess."
01â 15:8 But he said, "O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?"
01â 15:9 He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
01â 15:10 He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.
01â 15:11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
01â 15:12 As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.
01â 15:13 Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know this for certain, that your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs, and shall be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years;
01â 15:14 but I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
01â 15:15 As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
01â 15:16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
01â 15:17 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
01â 15:18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
01â 15:19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
01â 15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
01â 15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
01â 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar,
01â 16:2 and Sarai said to Abram, "You see that the LORD has prevented me from bearing children; go in to my slave-girl; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
01â 16:3 So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.
01â 16:4 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
01â 16:5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my slave-girl to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!"
01â 16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, "Your slave-girl is in your power; do to her as you please." Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she ran away from her.
01â 16:7 The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
01â 16:8 And he said, "Hagar, slave-girl of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai."
01â 16:9 The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her."
01â 16:10 The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will so greatly multiply your offspring that they cannot be counted for multitude."
01â 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said to her, "Now you have conceived and shall bear a son; you shall call him Ishmael, for the LORD has given heed to your affliction.
01â 16:12 He shall be a wild ass of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him; and he shall live at odds with all his kin."
01â 16:13 So she named the LORD who spoke to her, "You are El-roi"; for she said, "Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing him?"
01â 16:14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
01â 16:15 Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
01â 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
01â 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.
01â 17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous."
01â 17:3 Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him,
01â 17:4 "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
01â 17:5 No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
01â 17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you.
01â 17:7 I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
01â 17:8 And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God."
01â 17:9 God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
01â 17:10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
01â 17:11 You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
01â 17:12 Throughout your generations every male among you shall be circumcised when he is eight days old, including the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.
01â 17:13 Both the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money must be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
01â 17:14 Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
01â 17:15 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarah your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
01â 17:16 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
01â 17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
01â 17:18 And Abraham said to God, "O that Ishmael might live in your sight!"
01â 17:19 God said, "No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
01â 17:20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you; I will bless him and make him fruitful and exceedingly numerous; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
01â 17:21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year."
01â 17:22 And when he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
01â 17:23 Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
01â 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01â 17:25 And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01â 17:26 That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised;
01â 17:27 and all the men of his house, slaves born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
01â 18:1 The LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.
01â 18:2 He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground.
01â 18:3 He said, "My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant.
01â 18:4 Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
01â 18:5 Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on--since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."
01â 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes."
01â 18:7 Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it.
01â 18:8 Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
01â 18:9 They said to him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" And he said, "There, in the tent."
01â 18:10 Then one said, "I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him.
01â 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
01â 18:12 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"
01â 18:13 The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
01â 18:14 Is anything too wonderful for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son."
01â 18:15 But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. He said, "Oh yes, you did laugh."
01â 18:16 Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
01â 18:17 The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
01â 18:18 seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
01â 18:19 No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; so that the LORD may bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."
01â 18:20 Then the LORD said, "How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah and how very grave their sin!
01â 18:21 I must go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me; and if not, I will know."
01â 18:22 So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
01â 18:23 Then Abraham came near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01â 18:24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will you then sweep away the place and not forgive it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
01â 18:25 Far be it from you to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
01â 18:26 And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake."
01â 18:27 Abraham answered, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
01â 18:28 Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
01â 18:29 Again he spoke to him, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
01â 18:30 Then he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry if I speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
01â 18:31 He said, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."
01â 18:32 Then he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry if I speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."
01â 18:33 And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.
01â 19:1 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01â 19:2 He said, "Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the square."
01â 19:3 But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
01â 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house;
01â 19:5 and they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them."
01â 19:6 Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him,
01â 19:7 and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
01â 19:8 Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
01â 19:9 But they replied, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near the door to break it down.
01â 19:10 But the men inside reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
01â 19:11 And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they were unable to find the door.
01â 19:12 Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city--bring them out of the place.
01â 19:13 For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
01â 19:14 So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place; for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
01â 19:15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be consumed in the punishment of the city."
01â 19:16 But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and left him outside the city.
01â 19:17 When they had brought them outside, they said, "Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, or else you will be consumed."
01â 19:18 And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords;
01â 19:19 your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, for fear the disaster will overtake me and I die.
01â 19:20 Look, that city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there--is it not a little one?--and my life will be saved!"
01â 19:21 He said to him, "Very well, I grant you this favor too, and will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
01â 19:22 Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you arrive there." Therefore the city was called Zoar.
01â 19:23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
01â 19:24 Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
01â 19:25 and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
01â 19:26 But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
01â 19:27 Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD;
01â 19:28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the Plain and saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of a furnace.
01â 19:29 So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had settled.
01â 19:30 Now Lot went up out of Zoar and settled in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; so he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
01â 19:31 And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world.
01â 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
01â 19:33 So they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she rose.
01â 19:34 On the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Look, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
01â 19:35 So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger rose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she rose.
01â 19:36 Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
01â 19:37 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab; he is the ancestor of the Moabites to this day.
01â 19:38 The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi; he is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this day.
01â 20:1 From there Abraham journeyed toward the region of the Negeb, and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While residing in Gerar as an alien,
01â 20:2 Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." And King Abimelech of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
01â 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a married woman."
01â 20:4 Now Abimelech had not approached her; so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent people?
01â 20:5 Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I did this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands."
01â 20:6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; furthermore it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
01â 20:7 Now then, return the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours."
01â 20:8 So Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.
01â 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that ought not to be done."
01â 20:10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?"
01â 20:11 Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
01â 20:12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
01â 20:13 And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"
01â 20:14 Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
01â 20:15 Abimelech said, "My land is before you; settle where it pleases you."
01â 20:16 To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your exoneration before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
01â 20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
01â 20:18 For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
01â 21:1 The LORD dealt with Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as he had promised.
01â 21:2 Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him.
01â 21:3 Abraham gave the name Isaac to his son whom Sarah bore him.
01â 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
01â 21:5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01â 21:6 Now Sarah said, "God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me."
01â 21:7 And she said, "Who would ever have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
01â 21:8 The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
01â 21:9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
01â 21:10 So she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac."
01â 21:11 The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son.
01â 21:12 But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you.
01â 21:13 As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring."
01â 21:14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
01â 21:15 When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes.
01â 21:16 Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, "Do not let me look on the death of the child." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
01â 21:17 And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
01â 21:18 Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him."
01â 21:19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.
01â 21:20 God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.
01â 21:21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
01â 21:22 At that time Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do;
01â 21:23 now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have resided as an alien."
01â 21:24 And Abraham said, "I swear it."
01â 21:25 When Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,
01â 21:26 Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."
01â 21:27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
01â 21:28 Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.
01â 21:29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
01â 21:30 He said, "These seven ewe lambs you shall accept from my hand, in order that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
01â 21:31 Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there both of them swore an oath.
01â 21:32 When they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
01â 21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
01â 21:34 And Abraham resided as an alien many days in the land of the Philistines.
01â 22:1 After these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
01â 22:2 He said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you."
01â 22:3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him.
01â 22:4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away.
01â 22:5 Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you."
01â 22:6 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
01â 22:7 Isaac said to his father Abraham, "Father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
01â 22:8 Abraham said, "God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
01â 22:9 When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
01â 22:10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son.
01â 22:11 But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
01â 22:12 He said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
01â 22:13 And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
01â 22:14 So Abraham called that place "The LORD will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."
01â 22:15 The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
01â 22:16 and said, "By myself I have sworn, says the LORD: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
01â 22:17 I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies,
01â 22:18 and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice."
01â 22:19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.
01â 22:20 Now after these things it was told Abraham, "Milcah also has borne children, to your brother Nahor:
01â 22:21 Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
01â 22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
01â 22:23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
01â 22:24 Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
01â 23:1 Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years; this was the length of Sarah's life.
01â 23:2 And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
01â 23:3 Abraham rose up from beside his dead, and said to the Hittites,
01â 23:4 "I am a stranger and an alien residing among you; give me property among you for a burying place, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
01â 23:5 The Hittites answered Abraham,
01â 23:6 "Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold from you any burial ground for burying your dead."
01â 23:7 Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
01â 23:8 He said to them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron son of Zohar,
01â 23:9 so that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as a possession for a burying place."
01â 23:10 Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,
01â 23:11 "No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it; in the presence of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."
01â 23:12 Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
01â 23:13 He said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "If you only will listen to me! I will give the price of the field; accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there."
01â 23:14 Ephron answered Abraham,
01â 23:15 "My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver--what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."
01â 23:16 Abraham agreed with Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
01â 23:17 So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, passed
01â 23:18 to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, in the presence of all who went in at the gate of his city.
01â 23:19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
01â 23:20 The field and the cave that is in it passed from the Hittites into Abraham's possession as a burying place.
01â 24:1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
01â 24:2 Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
01â 24:3 and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,
01â 24:4 but will go to my country and to my kindred and get a wife for my son Isaac."
01â 24:5 The servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"
01â 24:6 Abraham said to him, "See to it that you do not take my son back there.
01â 24:7 The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
01â 24:8 But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there."
01â 24:9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
01â 24:10 Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all kinds of choice gifts from his master; and he set out and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
01â 24:11 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water; it was toward evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
01â 24:12 And he said, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
01â 24:13 I am standing here by the spring of water, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
01â 24:14 Let the girl to whom I shall say, 'Please offer your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'--let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master."
01â 24:15 Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, coming out with her water jar on her shoulder.
01â 24:16 The girl was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.
01â 24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please let me sip a little water from your jar."
01â 24:18 "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
01â 24:19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."
01â 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
01â 24:21 The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
01â 24:22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
01â 24:23 and said, "Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
01â 24:24 She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
01â 24:25 She added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder and a place to spend the night."
01â 24:26 The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
01â 24:27 and said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the way to the house of my master's kin."
01â 24:28 Then the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
01â 24:29 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.
01â 24:30 As soon as he had seen the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man; and there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.
01â 24:31 He said, "Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?"
01â 24:32 So the man came into the house; and Laban unloaded the camels, and gave him straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
01â 24:33 Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my errand." He said, "Speak on."
01â 24:34 So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
01â 24:35 The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.
01â 24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has.
01â 24:37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;
01â 24:38 but you shall go to my father's house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.'
01â 24:39 I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
01â 24:40 But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and make your way successful. You shall get a wife for my son from my kindred, from my father's house.
01â 24:41 Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred; even if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
01â 24:42 "I came today to the spring, and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going!
01â 24:43 I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, "Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"
01â 24:44 and who will say to me, "Drink, and I will draw for your camels also"--let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
01â 24:45 "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
01â 24:46 She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
01â 24:47 Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms.
01â 24:48 Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
01â 24:49 Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left."
01â 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing comes from the LORD; we cannot speak to you anything bad or good.
01â 24:51 Look, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
01â 24:52 When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.
01â 24:53 And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
01â 24:54 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they rose in the morning, he said, "Send me back to my master."
01â 24:55 Her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go."
01â 24:56 But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey successful; let me go that I may go to my master."
01â 24:57 They said, "We will call the girl, and ask her."
01â 24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will."
01â 24:59 So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham's servant and his men.
01â 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes."
01â 24:61 Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
01â 24:62 Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.
01â 24:63 Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming.
01â 24:64 And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel,
01â 24:65 and said to the servant, "Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.
01â 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
01â 24:67 Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
01â 25:1 Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
01â 25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
01â 25:3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
01â 25:4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
01â 25:5 Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.
01â 25:6 But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.
01â 25:7 This is the length of Abraham's life, one hundred seventy-five years.
01â 25:8 Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
01â 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,
01â 25:10 the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.
01â 25:11 After the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.
01â 25:12 These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's slave-girl, bore to Abraham.
01â 25:13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
01â 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
01â 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
01â 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.
01â 25:17 (This is the length of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty-seven years; he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)
01â 25:18 They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria; he settled down alongside of all his people.
01â 25:19 These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac,
01â 25:20 and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.
01â 25:21 Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
01â 25:22 The children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is to be this way, why do I live?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
01â 25:23 And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger."
01â 25:24 When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.
01â 25:25 The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.
01â 25:26 Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
01â 25:27 When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.
01â 25:28 Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01â 25:29 Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.
01â 25:30 Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!" (Therefore he was called Edom.)
01â 25:31 Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
01â 25:32 Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"
01â 25:33 Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
01â 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
01â 26:1 Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar, to King Abimelech of the Philistines.
01â 26:2 The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; settle in the land that I shall show you.
01â 26:3 Reside in this land as an alien, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will fulfill the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.
01â 26:4 I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and will give to your offspring all these lands; and all the nations of the earth shall gain blessing for themselves through your offspring,
01â 26:5 because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
01â 26:6 So Isaac settled in Gerar.
01â 26:7 When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister"; for he was afraid to say, "My wife," thinking, "or else the men of the place might kill me for the sake of Rebekah, because she is attractive in appearance."
01â 26:8 When Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw him fondling his wife Rebekah.
01â 26:9 So Abimelech called for Isaac, and said, "So she is your wife! Why then did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought I might die because of her."
01â 26:10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
01â 26:11 So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall be put to death."
01â 26:12 Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in the same year reaped a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him,
01â 26:13 and the man became rich; he prospered more and more until he became very wealthy.
01â 26:14 He had possessions of flocks and herds, and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.
01â 26:15 (Now the Philistines had stopped up and filled with earth all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.)
01â 26:16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us; you have become too powerful for us."
01â 26:17 So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.
01â 26:18 Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham; for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the names that his father had given them.
01â 26:19 But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,
01â 26:20 the herders of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herders, saying, "The water is ours." So he called the well Esek, because they contended with him.
01â 26:21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also; so he called it Sitnah.
01â 26:22 He moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
01â 26:23 From there he went up to Beer-sheba.
01â 26:24 And that very night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham; do not be afraid, for I am with you and will bless you and make your offspring numerous for my servant Abraham's sake."
01â 26:25 So he built an altar there, called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
01â 26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
01â 26:27 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?"
01â 26:28 They said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we say, let there be an oath between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you
01â 26:29 so that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD."
01â 26:30 So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
01â 26:31 In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths; and Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
01â 26:32 That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water!"
01â 26:33 He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
01â 26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite;
01â 26:35 and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
01â 27:1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called his elder son Esau and said to him, "My son"; and he answered, "Here I am."
01â 27:2 He said, "See, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
01â 27:3 Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me.
01â 27:4 Then prepare for me savory food, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die."
01â 27:5 Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
01â 27:6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "I heard your father say to your brother Esau,
01â 27:7 'Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food to eat, that I may bless you before the LORD before I die.'
01â 27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.
01â 27:9 Go to the flock, and get me two choice kids, so that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he likes;
01â 27:10 and you shall take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."
01â 27:11 But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, "Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a man of smooth skin.
01â 27:12 Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse on myself and not a blessing."
01â 27:13 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my word, and go, get them for me."
01â 27:14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.
01â 27:15 Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob;
01â 27:16 and she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
01â 27:17 Then she handed the savory food, and the bread that she had prepared, to her son Jacob.
01â 27:18 So he went in to his father, and said, "My father"; and he said, "Here I am; who are you, my son?"
01â 27:19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me."
01â 27:20 But Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God granted me success."
01â 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."
01â 27:22 So Jacob went up to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
01â 27:23 He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.
01â 27:24 He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am."
01â 27:25 Then he said, "Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
01â 27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."
01â 27:27 So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
01â 27:28 May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.
01â 27:29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"
01â 27:30 As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau came in from his hunting.
01â 27:31 He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father sit up and eat of his son's game, so that you may bless me."
01â 27:32 His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your firstborn son, Esau."
01â 27:33 Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him?--yes, and blessed he shall be!"
01â 27:34 When Esau heard his father's words, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, me also, father!"
01â 27:35 But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing."
01â 27:36 Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and look, now he has taken away my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
01â 27:37 Isaac answered Esau, "I have already made him your lord, and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?"
01â 27:38 Esau said to his father, "Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me, me also, father!" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
01â 27:39 Then his father Isaac answered him: "See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your home be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.
01â 27:40 By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose, you shall break his yoke from your neck."
01â 27:41 Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
01â 27:42 But the words of her elder son Esau were told to Rebekah; so she sent and called her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.
01â 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran,
01â 27:44 and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away--
01â 27:45 until your brother's anger against you turns away, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send, and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
01â 27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women such as these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?"
01â 28:1 Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, "You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women.
01â 28:2 Go at once to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father; and take as wife from there one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.
01â 28:3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and numerous, that you may become a company of peoples.
01â 28:4 May he give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien--land that God gave to Abraham."
01â 28:5 Thus Isaac sent Jacob away; and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
01â 28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he charged him, "You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women,"
01â 28:7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
01â 28:8 So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please his father Isaac,
01â 28:9 Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael, and sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.
01â 28:10 Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.
01â 28:11 He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place.
01â 28:12 And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
01â 28:13 And the LORD stood beside him and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring;
01â 28:14 and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring.
01â 28:15 Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
01â 28:16 Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place--and I did not know it!"
01â 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
01â 28:18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
01â 28:19 He called that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
01â 28:20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
01â 28:21 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,
01â 28:22 and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that you give me I will surely give one tenth to you."
01â 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the people of the east.
01â 29:2 As he looked, he saw a well in the field and three flocks of sheep lying there beside it; for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,
01â 29:3 and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.
01â 29:4 Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where do you come from?" They said, "We are from Haran."
01â 29:5 He said to them, "Do you know Laban son of Nahor?" They said, "We do."
01â 29:6 He said to them, "Is it well with him?" "Yes," they replied, "and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with the sheep."
01â 29:7 He said, "Look, it is still broad daylight; it is not time for the animals to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them."
01â 29:8 But they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
01â 29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.
01â 29:10 Now when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother's brother Laban, and the sheep of his mother's brother Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of his mother's brother Laban.
01â 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud.
01â 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
01â 29:13 When Laban heard the news about his sister's son Jacob, he ran to meet him; he embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,
01â 29:14 and Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh!" And he stayed with him a month.
01â 29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
01â 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
01â 29:17 Leah's eyes were lovely, and Rachel was graceful and beautiful.
01â 29:18 Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
01â 29:19 Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."
01â 29:20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
01â 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."
01â 29:22 So Laban gathered together all the people of the place, and made a feast.
01â 29:23 But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her.
01â 29:24 (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.)
01â 29:25 When morning came, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
01â 29:26 Laban said, "This is not done in our country--giving the younger before the firstborn.
01â 29:27 Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."
01â 29:28 Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.
01â 29:29 (Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)
01â 29:30 So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. He served Laban for another seven years.
01â 29:31 When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
01â 29:32 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben; for she said, "Because the LORD has looked on my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."
01â 29:33 She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also"; and she named him Simeon.
01â 29:34 Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons"; therefore he was named Levi.
01â 29:35 She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD"; therefore she named him Judah; then she ceased bearing.
01â 30:1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall die!"
01â 30:2 Jacob became very angry with Rachel and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
01â 30:3 Then she said, "Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees and that I too may have children through her."
01â 30:4 So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife; and Jacob went in to her.
01â 30:5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
01â 30:6 Then Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son"; therefore she named him Dan.
01â 30:7 Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
01â 30:8 Then Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed"; so she named him Naphtali.
01â 30:9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01â 30:10 Then Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
01â 30:11 And Leah said, "Good fortune!" so she named him Gad.
01â 30:12 Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
01â 30:13 And Leah said, "Happy am I! For the women will call me happy"; so she named him Asher.
01â 30:14 In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
01â 30:15 But she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel said, "Then he may lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
01â 30:16 When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
01â 30:17 And God heeded Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
01â 30:18 Leah said, "God has given me my hire because I gave my maid to my husband"; so she named him Issachar.
01â 30:19 And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
01â 30:20 Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons"; so she named him Zebulun.
01â 30:21 Afterwards she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
01â 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God heeded her and opened her womb.
01â 30:23 She conceived and bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach";
01â 30:24 and she named him Joseph, saying, "May the LORD add to me another son!"
01â 30:25 When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
01â 30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know very well the service I have given you."
01â 30:27 But Laban said to him, "If you will allow me to say so, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you;
01â 30:28 name your wages, and I will give it."
01â 30:29 Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.
01â 30:30 For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly; and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?"
01â 30:31 He said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it:
01â 30:32 let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
01â 30:33 So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen."
01â 30:34 Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."
01â 30:35 But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons;
01â 30:36 and he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was pasturing the rest of Laban's flock.
01â 30:37 Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods.
01â 30:38 He set the rods that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
01â 30:39 the flocks bred in front of the rods, and so the flocks produced young that were striped, speckled, and spotted.
01â 30:40 Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the completely black animals in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.
01â 30:41 Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods,
01â 30:42 but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
01â 30:43 Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
01â 31:1 Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, "Jacob has taken all that was our father's; he has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father."
01â 31:2 And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him as favorably as he did before.
01â 31:3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your ancestors and to your kindred, and I will be with you."
01â 31:4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was,
01â 31:5 and said to them, "I see that your father does not regard me as favorably as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
01â 31:6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength;
01â 31:7 yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.
01â 31:8 If he said, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.
01â 31:9 Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father, and given them to me.
01â 31:10 During the mating of the flock I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats that leaped upon the flock were striped, speckled, and mottled.
01â 31:11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'
01â 31:12 And he said, 'Look up and see that all the goats that leap on the flock are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
01â 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and return to the land of your birth.'"
01â 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?
01â 31:15 Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.
01â 31:16 All the property that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you."
01â 31:17 So Jacob arose, and set his children and his wives on camels;
01â 31:18 and he drove away all his livestock, all the property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
01â 31:19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
01â 31:20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee.
01â 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; starting out he crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
01â 31:22 On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
01â 31:23 So he took his kinsfolk with him and pursued him for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
01â 31:24 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, "Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad."
01â 31:25 Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsfolk camped in the hill country of Gilead.
01â 31:26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword.
01â 31:27 Why did you flee secretly and deceive me and not tell me? I would have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre.
01â 31:28 And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? What you have done is foolish.
01â 31:29 It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.'
01â 31:30 Even though you had to go because you longed greatly for your father's house, why did you steal my gods?"
01â 31:31 Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
01â 31:32 But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsfolk, point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
01â 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered Rachel's.
01â 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt all about in the tent, but did not find them.
01â 31:35 And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the household gods.
01â 31:36 Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban. Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
01â 31:37 Although you have felt about through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsfolk and your kinsfolk, so that they may decide between us two.
01â 31:38 These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
01â 31:39 That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
01â 31:40 It was like this with me: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
01â 31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
01â 31:42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
01â 31:43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about their children whom they have borne?
01â 31:44 Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me."
01â 31:45 So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar.
01â 31:46 And Jacob said to his kinsfolk, "Gather stones," and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap.
01â 31:47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
01â 31:48 Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he called it Galeed,
01â 31:49 and the pillar Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are absent one from the other.
01â 31:50 If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, though no one else is with us, remember that God is witness between you and me."
01â 31:51 Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and see the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
01â 31:52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
01â 31:53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor"--the God of their father--"judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,
01â 31:54 and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the height and called his kinsfolk to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night in the hill country.
01â 31:55 Early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them; then he departed and returned home.
01â 32:1 Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him;
01â 32:2 and when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's camp!" So he called that place Mahanaim.
01â 32:3 Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,
01â 32:4 instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have lived with Laban as an alien, and stayed until now;
01â 32:5 and I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"
01â 32:6 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
01â 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies,
01â 32:8 thinking, "If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company that is left will escape."
01â 32:9 And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will do you good,'
01â 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.
01â 32:11 Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him; he may come and kill us all, the mothers with the children.
01â 32:12 Yet you have said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted because of their number.'"
01â 32:13 So he spent that night there, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,
01â 32:14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
01â 32:15 thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
01â 32:16 These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on ahead of me, and put a space between drove and drove."
01â 32:17 He instructed the foremost, "When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'
01â 32:18 then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.'"
01â 32:19 He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him,
01â 32:20 and you shall say, 'Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
01â 32:21 So the present passed on ahead of him; and he himself spent that night in the camp.
01â 32:22 The same night he got up and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
01â 32:23 He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had.
01â 32:24 Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
01â 32:25 When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he struck him on the hip socket; and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
01â 32:26 Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is breaking." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me."
01â 32:27 So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
01â 32:28 Then the man said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with humans, and have prevailed."
01â 32:29 Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
01â 32:30 So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved."
01â 32:31 The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.
01â 32:32 Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the hip socket, because he struck Jacob on the hip socket at the thigh muscle.
01â 33:1 Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.
01â 33:2 He put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
01â 33:3 He himself went on ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near his brother.
01â 33:4 But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
01â 33:5 When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he said, "Who are these with you?" Jacob said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
01â 33:6 Then the maids drew near, they and their children, and bowed down;
01â 33:7 Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down; and finally Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
01â 33:8 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company that I met?" Jacob answered, "To find favor with my lord."
01â 33:9 But Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."
01â 33:10 Jacob said, "No, please; if I find favor with you, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God--since you have received me with such favor.
01â 33:11 Please accept my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I want." So he urged him, and he took it.
01â 33:12 Then Esau said, "Let us journey on our way, and I will go alongside you."
01â 33:13 But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; and if they are overdriven for one day, all the flocks will die.
01â 33:14 Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."
01â 33:15 So Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "Why should my lord be so kind to me?"
01â 33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
01â 33:17 But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore the place is called Succoth.
01â 33:18 Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.
01â 33:19 And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for one hundred pieces of money the plot of land on which he had pitched his tent.
01â 33:20 There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
01â 34:1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the region.
01â 34:2 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the region, saw her, he seized her and lay with her by force.
01â 34:3 And his soul was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the girl, and spoke tenderly to her.
01â 34:4 So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this girl to be my wife."
01â 34:5 Now Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah; but his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
01â 34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him,
01â 34:7 just as the sons of Jacob came in from the field. When they heard of it, the men were indignant and very angry, because he had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
01â 34:8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The heart of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.
01â 34:9 Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
01â 34:10 You shall live with us; and the land shall be open to you; live and trade in it, and get property in it."
01â 34:11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor with you, and whatever you say to me I will give.
01â 34:12 Put the marriage present and gift as high as you like, and I will give whatever you ask me; only give me the girl to be my wife."
01â 34:13 The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
01â 34:14 They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
01â 34:15 Only on this condition will we consent to you: that you will become as we are and every male among you be circumcised.
01â 34:16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people.
01â 34:17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone."
01â 34:18 Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
01â 34:19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his family.
01â 34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
01â 34:21 "These people are friendly with us; let them live in the land and trade in it, for the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them our daughters.
01â 34:22 Only on this condition will they agree to live among us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
01â 34:23 Will not their livestock, their property, and all their animals be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live among us."
01â 34:24 And all who went out of the city gate heeded Hamor and his son Shechem; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
01â 34:25 On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city unawares, and killed all the males.
01â 34:26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.
01â 34:27 And the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled.
01â 34:28 They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
01â 34:29 All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and made their prey.
01â 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household."
01â 34:31 But they said, "Should our sister be treated like a whore?"
01â 35:1 God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
01â 35:2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes;
01â 35:3 then come, let us go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
01â 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.
01â 35:5 As they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities all around them, so that no one pursued them.
01â 35:6 Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
01â 35:7 and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
01â 35:8 And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So it was called Allon-bacuth.
01â 35:9 God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him.
01â 35:10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall you be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he was called Israel.
01â 35:11 God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.
01â 35:12 The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you."
01â 35:13 Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.
01â 35:14 Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
01â 35:15 So Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
01â 35:16 Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.
01â 35:17 When she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son."
01â 35:18 As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
01â 35:19 So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
01â 35:20 and Jacob set up a pillar at her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
01â 35:21 Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
01â 35:22 While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
01â 35:23 The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
01â 35:24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
01â 35:25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali.
01â 35:26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
01â 35:27 Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had resided as aliens.
01â 35:28 Now the days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.
01â 35:29 And Isaac breathed his last; he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
01â 36:1 These are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom).
01â 36:2 Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah son of Zibeon the Hivite,
01â 36:3 and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
01â 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; Basemath bore Reuel;
01â 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
01â 36:6 Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his cattle, all his livestock, and all the property he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and he moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.
01â 36:7 For their possessions were too great for them to live together; the land where they were staying could not support them because of their livestock.
01â 36:8 So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
01â 36:9 These are the descendants of Esau, ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.
01â 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz son of Adah the wife of Esau; Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
01â 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
01â 36:12 (Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son; she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These were the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.
01â 36:13 These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife, Basemath.
01â 36:14 These were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah son of Zibeon: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
01â 36:15 These are the clans of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: the clans Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
01â 36:16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek; these are the clans of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Adah.
01â 36:17 These are the sons of Esau's son Reuel: the clans Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah; these are the clans of Reuel in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01â 36:18 These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: the clans Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the clans born of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
01â 36:19 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their clans.
01â 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01â 36:21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; these are the clans of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
01â 36:22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
01â 36:23 These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
01â 36:24 These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; he is the Anah who found the springs in the wilderness, as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
01â 36:25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01â 36:26 These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
01â 36:27 These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
01â 36:28 These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
01â 36:29 These are the clans of the Horites: the clans Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01â 36:30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; these are the clans of the Horites, clan by clan in the land of Seir.
01â 36:31 These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the Israelites.
01â 36:32 Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom, the name of his city being Dinhabah.
01â 36:33 Bela died, and Jobab son of Zerah of Bozrah succeeded him as king.
01â 36:34 Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
01â 36:35 Husham died, and Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king, the name of his city being Avith.
01â 36:36 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him as king.
01â 36:37 Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates succeeded him as king.
01â 36:38 Shaul died, and Baal-hanan son of Achbor succeeded him as king.
01â 36:39 Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, and Hadar succeeded him as king, the name of his city being Pau; his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-zahab.
01â 36:40 These are the names of the clans of Esau, according to their families and their localities by their names: the clans Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01â 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01â 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01â 36:43 Magdiel, and Iram; these are the clans of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of Edom), according to their settlements in the land that they held.
01â 37:1 Jacob settled in the land where his father had lived as an alien, the land of Canaan.
01â 37:2 This is the story of the family of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a helper to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.
01â 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a long robe with sleeves.
01â 37:4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
01â 37:5 Once Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
01â 37:6 He said to them, "Listen to this dream that I dreamed.
01â 37:7 There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright; then your sheaves gathered around it, and bowed down to my sheaf."
01â 37:8 His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Are you indeed to have dominion over us?" So they hated him even more because of his dreams and his words.
01â 37:9 He had another dream, and told it to his brothers, saying, "Look, I have had another dream: the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
01â 37:10 But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, "What kind of dream is this that you have had? Shall we indeed come, I and your mother and your brothers, and bow to the ground before you?"
01â 37:11 So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
01â 37:12 Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.
01â 37:13 And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." He answered, "Here I am."
01â 37:14 So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock; and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron. He came to Shechem,
01â 37:15 and a man found him wandering in the fields; the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"
01â 37:16 "I am seeking my brothers," he said; "tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock."
01â 37:17 The man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.
01â 37:18 They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they conspired to kill him.
01â 37:19 They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer.
01â 37:20 Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild animal has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
01â 37:21 But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life."
01â 37:22 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"--that he might rescue him out of their hand and restore him to his father.
01â 37:23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;
01â 37:24 and they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
01â 37:25 Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balm, and resin, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
01â 37:26 Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
01â 37:27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers agreed.
01â 37:28 When some Midianite traders passed by, they drew Joseph up, lifting him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.
01â 37:29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes.
01â 37:30 He returned to his brothers, and said, "The boy is gone; and I, where can I turn?"
01â 37:31 Then they took Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood.
01â 37:32 They had the long robe with sleeves taken to their father, and they said, "This we have found; see now whether it is your son's robe or not."
01â 37:33 He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's robe! A wild animal has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."
01â 37:34 Then Jacob tore his garments, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
01â 37:35 All his sons and all his daughters sought to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father bewailed him.
01â 37:36 Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
01â 38:1 It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and settled near a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.
01â 38:2 There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; he married her and went in to her.
01â 38:3 She conceived and bore a son; and he named him Er.
01â 38:4 Again she conceived and bore a son whom she named Onan.
01â 38:5 Yet again she bore a son, and she named him Shelah. She was in Chezib when she bore him.
01â 38:6 Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar.
01â 38:7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
01â 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her; raise up offspring for your brother."
01â 38:9 But since Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, he spilled his semen on the ground whenever he went in to his brother's wife, so that he would not give offspring to his brother.
01â 38:10 What he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.
01â 38:11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"--for he feared that he too would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
01â 38:12 In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died; when Judah's time of mourning was over, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
01â 38:13 When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"
01â 38:14 she put off her widow's garments, put on a veil, wrapped herself up, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not been given to him in marriage.
01â 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
01â 38:16 He went over to her at the road side, and said, "Come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
01â 38:17 He answered, "I will send you a kid from the flock." And she said, "Only if you give me a pledge, until you send it."
01â 38:18 He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your signet and your cord, and the staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
01â 38:19 Then she got up and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
01â 38:20 When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to recover the pledge from the woman, he could not find her.
01â 38:21 He asked the townspeople, "Where is the temple prostitute who was at Enaim by the wayside?" But they said, "No prostitute has been here."
01â 38:22 So he returned to Judah, and said, "I have not found her; moreover the townspeople said, 'No prostitute has been here.'"
01â 38:23 Judah replied, "Let her keep the things as her own, otherwise we will be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her."
01â 38:24 About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the whore; moreover she is pregnant as a result of whoredom." And Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."
01â 38:25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, "It was the owner of these who made me pregnant." And she said, "Take note, please, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."
01â 38:26 Then Judah acknowledged them and said, "She is more in the right than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not lie with her again.
01â 38:27 When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.
01â 38:28 While she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a crimson thread, saying, "This one came out first."
01â 38:29 But just then he drew back his hand, and out came his brother; and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" Therefore he was named Perez.
01â 38:30 Afterward his brother came out with the crimson thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah.
01â 39:1 Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
01â 39:2 The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man; he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
01â 39:3 His master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hands.
01â 39:4 So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him; he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
01â 39:5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
01â 39:6 So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge; and, with him there, he had no concern for anything but the food that he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking.
01â 39:7 And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, "Lie with me."
01â 39:8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, with me here, my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand.
01â 39:9 He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
01â 39:10 And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not consent to lie beside her or to be with her.
01â 39:11 One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work, and while no one else was in the house,
01â 39:12 she caught hold of his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside.
01â 39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
01â 39:14 she called out to the members of her household and said to them, "See, my husband has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us! He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;
01â 39:15 and when he heard me raise my voice and cry out, he left his garment beside me, and fled outside."
01â 39:16 Then she kept his garment by her until his master came home,
01â 39:17 and she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;
01â 39:18 but as soon as I raised my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me, and fled outside."
01â 39:19 When his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, saying, "This is the way your servant treated me," he became enraged.
01â 39:20 And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; he remained there in prison.
01â 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love; he gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
01â 39:22 The chief jailer committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison, and whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
01â 39:23 The chief jailer paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph's care, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper.
01â 40:1 Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
01â 40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
01â 40:3 and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
01â 40:4 The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody.
01â 40:5 One night they both dreamed--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison--each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning.
01â 40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
01â 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh's officers, who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"
01â 40:8 They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me."
01â 40:9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me,
01â 40:10 and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and the clusters ripened into grapes.
01â 40:11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
01â 40:12 Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;
01â 40:13 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
01â 40:14 But remember me when it is well with you; please do me the kindness to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this place.
01â 40:15 For in fact I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon."
01â 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
01â 40:17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."
01â 40:18 And Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
01â 40:19 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a pole; and the birds will eat the flesh from you."
01â 40:20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
01â 40:21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;
01â 40:22 but the chief baker he hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
01â 40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
01â 41:1 After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,
01â 41:2 and there came up out of the Nile seven sleek and fat cows, and they grazed in the reed grass.
01â 41:3 Then seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
01â 41:4 The ugly and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
01â 41:5 Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
01â 41:6 Then seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them.
01â 41:7 The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.
01â 41:8 In the morning his spirit was troubled; so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
01â 41:9 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my faults today.
01â 41:10 Once Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard.
01â 41:11 We dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning.
01â 41:12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each according to his dream.
01â 41:13 As he interpreted to us, so it turned out; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."
01â 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was hurriedly brought out of the dungeon. When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.
01â 41:15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
01â 41:16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not I; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
01â 41:17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile;
01â 41:18 and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.
01â 41:19 Then seven other cows came up after them, poor, very ugly, and thin. Never had I seen such ugly ones in all the land of Egypt.
01â 41:20 The thin and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows,
01â 41:21 but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had done so, for they were still as ugly as before. Then I awoke.
01â 41:22 I fell asleep a second time and I saw in my dream seven ears of grain, full and good, growing on one stalk,
01â 41:23 and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouting after them;
01â 41:24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. But when I told it to the magicians, there was no one who could explain it to me."
01â 41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01â 41:26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
01â 41:27 The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, as are the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind. They are seven years of famine.
01â 41:28 It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01â 41:29 There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
01â 41:30 After them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land.
01â 41:31 The plenty will no longer be known in the land because of the famine that will follow, for it will be very grievous.
01â 41:32 And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.
01â 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
01â 41:34 Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.
01â 41:35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
01â 41:36 That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."
01â 41:37 The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
01â 41:38 Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find anyone else like this--one in whom is the spirit of God?"
01â 41:39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
01â 41:40 You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you."
01â 41:41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
01â 41:42 Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph's hand; he arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.
01â 41:43 He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command; and they cried out in front of him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
01â 41:44 Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
01â 41:45 Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. Thus Joseph gained authority over the land of Egypt.
01â 41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.
01â 41:47 During the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.
01â 41:48 He gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.
01â 41:49 So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance--like the sand of the sea--that he stopped measuring it; it was beyond measure.
01â 41:50 Before the years of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
01â 41:51 Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."
01â 41:52 The second he named Ephraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortunes."
01â 41:53 The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;
01â 41:54 and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every country, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.
01â 41:55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do."
01â 41:56 And since the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
01â 41:57 Moreover, all the world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine became severe throughout the world.
01â 42:1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you keep looking at one another?
01â 42:2 I have heard," he said, "that there is grain in Egypt; go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die."
01â 42:3 So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
01â 42:4 But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he feared that harm might come to him.
01â 42:5 Thus the sons of Israel were among the other people who came to buy grain, for the famine had reached the land of Canaan.
01â 42:6 Now Joseph was governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
01â 42:7 When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he said. They said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
01â 42:8 Although Joseph had recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
01â 42:9 Joseph also remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them. He said to them, "You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land!"
01â 42:10 They said to him, "No, my lord; your servants have come to buy food.
01â 42:11 We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants have never been spies."
01â 42:12 But he said to them, "No, you have come to see the nakedness of the land!"
01â 42:13 They said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of a certain man in the land of Canaan; the youngest, however, is now with our father, and one is no more."
01â 42:14 But Joseph said to them, "It is just as I have said to you; you are spies!
01â 42:15 Here is how you shall be tested: as Pharaoh lives, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here!
01â 42:16 Let one of you go and bring your brother, while the rest of you remain in prison, in order that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh lives, surely you are spies."
01â 42:17 And he put them all together in prison for three days.
01â 42:18 On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
01â 42:19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here where you are imprisoned. The rest of you shall go and carry grain for the famine of your households,
01â 42:20 and bring your youngest brother to me. Thus your words will be verified, and you shall not die." And they agreed to do so.
01â 42:21 They said to one another, "Alas, we are paying the penalty for what we did to our brother; we saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this anguish has come upon us."
01â 42:22 Then Reuben answered them, "Did I not tell you not to wrong the boy? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood."
01â 42:23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, since he spoke with them through an interpreter.
01â 42:24 He turned away from them and wept; then he returned and spoke to them. And he picked out Simeon and had him bound before their eyes.
01â 42:25 Joseph then gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return every man's money to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This was done for them.
01â 42:26 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed.
01â 42:27 When one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money at the top of the sack.
01â 42:28 He said to his brothers, "My money has been put back; here it is in my sack!" At this they lost heart and turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
01â 42:29 When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
01â 42:30 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us, and charged us with spying on the land.
01â 42:31 But we said to him, 'We are honest men, we are not spies.
01â 42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.'
01â 42:33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
01â 42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will release your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.'"
01â 42:35 As they were emptying their sacks, there in each one's sack was his bag of money. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed.
01â 42:36 And their father Jacob said to them, "I am the one you have bereaved of children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has happened to me!"
01â 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you."
01â 42:38 But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should come to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
01â 43:1 Now the famine was severe in the land.
01â 43:2 And when they had eaten up the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little more food."
01â 43:3 But Judah said to him, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
01â 43:4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food;
01â 43:5 but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
01â 43:6 Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?"
01â 43:7 They replied, "The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
01â 43:8 Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and let us be on our way, so that we may live and not die--you and we and also our little ones.
01â 43:9 I myself will be surety for him; you can hold me accountable for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
01â 43:10 If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice."
01â 43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry them down as a present to the man--a little balm and a little honey, gum, resin, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
01â 43:12 Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the top of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight.
01â 43:13 Take your brother also, and be on your way again to the man;
01â 43:14 may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, so that he may send back your other brother and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
01â 43:15 So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, as well as Benjamin. Then they went on their way down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
01â 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon."
01â 43:17 The man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house.
01â 43:18 Now the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It is because of the money, replaced in our sacks the first time, that we have been brought in, so that he may have an opportunity to fall upon us, to make slaves of us and take our donkeys."
01â 43:19 So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the entrance to the house.
01â 43:20 They said, "Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food;
01â 43:21 and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each one's money in the top of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it back with us.
01â 43:22 Moreover we have brought down with us additional money to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."
01â 43:23 He replied, "Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
01â 43:24 When the steward had brought the men into Joseph's house, and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,
01â 43:25 they made the present ready for Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they would dine there.
01â 43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought him the present that they had carried into the house, and bowed to the ground before him.
01â 43:27 He inquired about their welfare, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
01â 43:28 They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and did obeisance.
01â 43:29 Then he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!"
01â 43:30 With that, Joseph hurried out, because he was overcome with affection for his brother, and he was about to weep. So he went into a private room and wept there.
01â 43:31 Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, "Serve the meal."
01â 43:32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
01â 43:33 When they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, the men looked at one another in amazement.
01â 43:34 Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.
01â 44:1 Then he commanded the steward of his house, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the top of his sack.
01â 44:2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the top of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph told him.
01â 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.
01â 44:4 When they had gone only a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, "Go, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?
01â 44:5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks? Does he not indeed use it for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.'"
01â 44:6 When he overtook them, he repeated these words to them.
01â 44:7 They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
01â 44:8 Look, the money that we found at the top of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; why then would we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
01â 44:9 Should it be found with any one of your servants, let him die; moreover the rest of us will become my lord's slaves."
01â 44:10 He said, "Even so; in accordance with your words, let it be: he with whom it is found shall become my slave, but the rest of you shall go free."
01â 44:11 Then each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack.
01â 44:12 He searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
01â 44:13 At this they tore their clothes. Then each one loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
01â 44:14 Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house while he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.
01â 44:15 Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that one such as I can practice divination?"
01â 44:16 And Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; here we are then, my lord's slaves, both we and also the one in whose possession the cup has been found."
01â 44:17 But he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the one in whose possession the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
01â 44:18 Then Judah stepped up to him and said, "O my lord, let your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.
01â 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?'
01â 44:20 And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead; he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
01â 44:21 Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, so that I may set my eyes on him.'
01â 44:22 We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
01â 44:23 Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.'
01â 44:24 When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord.
01â 44:25 And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'
01â 44:26 we said, 'We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother goes with us, will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
01â 44:27 Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons;
01â 44:28 one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since.
01â 44:29 If you take this one also from me, and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.'
01â 44:30 Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,
01â 44:31 when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
01â 44:32 For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.'
01â 44:33 Now therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord in place of the boy; and let the boy go back with his brothers.
01â 44:34 For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the suffering that would come upon my father."
01â 45:1 Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, "Send everyone away from me." So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
01â 45:2 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
01â 45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.
01â 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come closer to me." And they came closer. He said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
01â 45:5 And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
01â 45:6 For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
01â 45:7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
01â 45:8 So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
01â 45:9 Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
01â 45:10 You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
01â 45:11 I will provide for you there--since there are five more years of famine to come--so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.'
01â 45:12 And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my own mouth that speaks to you.
01â 45:13 You must tell my father how greatly I am honored in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."
01â 45:14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck.
01â 45:15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.
01â 45:16 When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, "Joseph's brothers have come," Pharaoh and his servants were pleased.
01â 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your animals and go back to the land of Canaan.
01â 45:18 Take your father and your households and come to me, so that I may give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you may enjoy the fat of the land.'
01â 45:19 You are further charged to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
01â 45:20 Give no thought to your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
01â 45:21 The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons according to the instruction of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey.
01â 45:22 To each one of them he gave a set of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of garments.
01â 45:23 To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
01â 45:24 Then he sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Do not quarrel along the way."
01â 45:25 So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
01â 45:26 And they told him, "Joseph is still alive! He is even ruler over all the land of Egypt." He was stunned; he could not believe them.
01â 45:27 But when they told him all the words of Joseph that he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
01â 45:28 Israel said, "Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I must go and see him before I die."
01â 46:1 When Israel set out on his journey with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
01â 46:2 God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am."
01â 46:3 Then he said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there.
01â 46:4 I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph's own hand shall close your eyes."
01â 46:5 Then Jacob set out from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
01â 46:6 They also took their livestock and the goods that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,
01â 46:7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.
01â 46:8 Now these are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his offspring, who came to Egypt. Reuben, Jacob's firstborn,
01â 46:9 and the children of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
01â 46:10 The children of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
01â 46:11 The children of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
01â 46:12 The children of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the children of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
01â 46:13 The children of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.
01â 46:14 The children of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel
01â 46:15 (these are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah; in all his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three).
01â 46:16 The children of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
01â 46:17 The children of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. The children of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel
01â 46:18 (these are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and these she bore to Jacob--sixteen persons).
01â 46:19 The children of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
01â 46:20 To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
01â 46:21 The children of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard
01â 46:22 (these are the children of Rachel, who were born to Jacob--fourteen persons in all).
01â 46:23 The children of Dan: Hashum.
01â 46:24 The children of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem
01â 46:25 (these are the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and these she bore to Jacob--seven persons in all).
01â 46:26 All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including the wives of his sons, were sixty-six persons in all.
01â 46:27 The children of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.
01â 46:28 Israel sent Judah ahead to Joseph to lead the way before him into Goshen. When they came to the land of Goshen,
01â 46:29 Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. He presented himself to him, fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
01â 46:30 Israel said to Joseph, "I can die now, having seen for myself that you are still alive."
01â 46:31 Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
01â 46:32 The men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.'
01â 46:33 When Pharaoh calls you, and says, 'What is your occupation?'
01â 46:34 you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our ancestors'--in order that you may settle in the land of Goshen, because all shepherds are abhorrent to the Egyptians."
01â 47:1 So Joseph went and told Pharaoh, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; they are now in the land of Goshen."
01â 47:2 From among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
01â 47:3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, as our ancestors were."
01â 47:4 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to reside as aliens in the land; for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks because the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, we ask you, let your servants settle in the land of Goshen."
01â 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
01â 47:6 The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land; let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know that there are capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
01â 47:7 Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob, and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
01â 47:8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the years of your life?"
01â 47:9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my earthly sojourn are one hundred thirty; few and hard have been the years of my life. They do not compare with the years of the life of my ancestors during their long sojourn."
01â 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
01â 47:11 Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and granted them a holding in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed.
01â 47:12 And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
01â 47:13 Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe. The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
01â 47:14 Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
01â 47:15 When the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan was spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, "Give us food! Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone."
01â 47:16 And Joseph answered, "Give me your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone."
01â 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph; and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. That year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
01â 47:18 When that year was ended, they came to him the following year, and said to him, "We can not hide from my lord that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands.
01â 47:19 Shall we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food. We with our land will become slaves to Pharaoh; just give us seed, so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."
01â 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. All the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.
01â 47:21 As for the people, he made slaves of them from one end of Egypt to the other.
01â 47:22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh, and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
01â 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you; sow the land.
01â 47:24 And at the harvests you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones."
01â 47:25 They said, "You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be slaves to Pharaoh."
01â 47:26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. The land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
01â 47:27 Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen; and they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.
01â 47:28 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
01â 47:29 When the time of Israel's death drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor with you, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt.
01â 47:30 When I lie down with my ancestors, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." He answered, "I will do as you have said."
01â 47:31 And he said, "Swear to me"; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the head of his bed.
01â 48:1 After this Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
01â 48:2 When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," he summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
01â 48:3 And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me,
01â 48:4 and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers; I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for a perpetual holding.'
01â 48:5 Therefore your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are now mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are.
01â 48:6 As for the offspring born to you after them, they shall be yours. They shall be recorded under the names of their brothers with regard to their inheritance.
01â 48:7 For when I came from Paddan, Rachel, alas, died in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem).
01â 48:8 When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
01â 48:9 Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
01â 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see well. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.
01â 48:11 Israel said to Joseph, "I did not expect to see your face; and here God has let me see your children also."
01â 48:12 Then Joseph removed them from his father's knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
01â 48:13 Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them near him.
01â 48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
01â 48:15 He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
01â 48:16 the angel who has redeemed me from all harm, bless the boys; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth."
01â 48:17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
01â 48:18 Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father! Since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head."
01â 48:19 But his father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."
01â 48:20 So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will invoke blessings, saying, 'God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
01â 48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your ancestors.
01â 48:22 I now give to you one portion more than to your brothers, the portion that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."
01â 49:1 Then Jacob called his sons, and said: "Gather around, that I may tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
01â 49:2 Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob; listen to Israel your father.
01â 49:3 Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the first fruits of my vigor, excelling in rank and excelling in power.
01â 49:4 Unstable as water, you shall no longer excel because you went up onto your father's bed; then you defiled it--you went up onto my couch!
01â 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords.
01â 49:6 May I never come into their council; may I not be joined to their company--for in their anger they killed men, and at their whim they hamstrung oxen.
01â 49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
01â 49:8 Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down before you.
01â 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He crouches down, he stretches out like a lion, like a lioness--who dares rouse him up?
01â 49:10 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and the obedience of the peoples is his.
01â 49:11 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine and his robe in the blood of grapes;
01â 49:12 his eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
01â 49:13 Zebulun shall settle at the shore of the sea; he shall be a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sidon.
01â 49:14 Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds;
01â 49:15 he saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant; so he bowed his shoulder to the burden, and became a slave at forced labor.
01â 49:16 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
01â 49:17 Dan shall be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider falls backward.
01â 49:18 I wait for your salvation, O LORD.
01â 49:19 Gad shall be raided by raiders, but he shall raid at their heels.
01â 49:20 Asher's food shall be rich, and he shall provide royal delicacies.
01â 49:21 Naphtali is a doe let loose that bears lovely fawns.
01â 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall.
01â 49:23 The archers fiercely attacked him; they shot at him and pressed him hard.
01â 49:24 Yet his bow remained taut, and his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
01â 49:25 by the God of your father, who will help you, by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
01â 49:26 The blessings of your father are stronger than the blessings of the eternal mountains, the bounties of the everlasting hills; may they be on the head of Joseph, on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers.
01â 49:27 Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey, and at evening dividing the spoil."
01â 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, blessing each one of them with a suitable blessing.
01â 49:29 Then he charged them, saying to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my ancestors--in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
01â 49:30 in the cave in the field at Machpelah, near Mamre, in the land of Canaan, in the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
01â 49:31 There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried; there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried; and there I buried Leah--
01â 49:32 the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites."
01â 49:33 When Jacob ended his charge to his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
01â 50:1 Then Joseph threw himself on his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
01â 50:2 Joseph commanded the physicians in his service to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel;
01â 50:3 they spent forty days in doing this, for that is the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
01â 50:4 When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph addressed the household of Pharaoh, "If now I have found favor with you, please speak to Pharaoh as follows:
01â 50:5 My father made me swear an oath; he said, 'I am about to die. In the tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.' Now therefore let me go up, so that I may bury my father; then I will return."
01â 50:6 Pharaoh answered, "Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear to do."
01â 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
01â 50:8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.
01â 50:9 Both chariots and charioteers went up with him. It was a very great company.
01â 50:10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held there a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed a time of mourning for his father seven days.
01â 50:11 When the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning on the part of the Egyptians." Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.
01â 50:12 Thus his sons did for him as he had instructed them.
01â 50:13 They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, the field near Mamre, which Abraham bought as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
01â 50:14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
01â 50:15 Realizing that their father was dead, Joseph's brothers said, "What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong that we did to him?"
01â 50:16 So they approached Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this instruction before he died,
01â 50:17 'Say to Joseph: I beg you, forgive the crime of your brothers and the wrong they did in harming you.' Now therefore please forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
01â 50:18 Then his brothers also wept, fell down before him, and said, "We are here as your slaves."
01â 50:19 But Joseph said to them, "Do not be afraid! Am I in the place of God?
01â 50:20 Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today.
01â 50:21 So have no fear; I myself will provide for you and your little ones." In this way he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.
01â 50:22 So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's household; and Joseph lived one hundred ten years.
01â 50:23 Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were also born on Joseph's knees.
01â 50:24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die; but God will surely come to you, and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
01â 50:25 So Joseph made the Israelites swear, saying, "When God comes to you, you shall carry up my bones from here."
01â 50:26 And Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old; he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
02
02 1:1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
02 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
02 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
02 1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
02 1:5 The total number of people born to Jacob was seventy. Joseph was already in Egypt.
02 1:6 Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole generation.
02 1:7 But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
02 1:8 Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
02 1:9 He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we.
02 1:10 Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land."
02 1:11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built supply cities, Pithom and Rameses, for Pharaoh.
02 1:12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
02 1:13 The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites,
02 1:14 and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them.
02 1:15 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
02 1:16 "When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she shall live."
02 1:17 But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live.
02 1:18 So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?"
02 1:19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
02 1:20 So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.
02 1:21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
02 1:22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "Every boy that is born to the Hebrews you shall throw into the Nile, but you shall let every girl live."
02 2:1 Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman.
02 2:2 The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine baby, she hid him three months.
02 2:3 When she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him, and plastered it with bitumen and pitch; she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the river.
02 2:4 His sister stood at a distance, to see what would happen to him.
02 2:5 The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to bring it.
02 2:6 When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him, "This must be one of the Hebrews' children," she said.
02 2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"
02 2:8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Yes." So the girl went and called the child's mother.
02 2:9 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed it.
02 2:10 When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and she took him as her son. She named him Moses, "because," she said, "I drew him out of the water."
02 2:11 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and saw their forced labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his kinsfolk.
02 2:12 He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
02 2:13 When he went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting; and he said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow Hebrew?"
02 2:14 He answered, "Who made you a ruler and judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "Surely the thing is known."
02 2:15 When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh. He settled in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well.
02 2:16 The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
02 2:17 But some shepherds came and drove them away. Moses got up and came to their defense and watered their flock.
02 2:18 When they returned to their father Reuel, he said, "How is it that you have come back so soon today?"
02 2:19 They said, "An Egyptian helped us against the shepherds; he even drew water for us and watered the flock."
02 2:20 He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to break bread."
02 2:21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah in marriage.
02 2:22 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom; for he said, "I have been an alien residing in a foreign land."
02 2:23 After a long time the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out. Out of the slavery their cry for help rose up to God.
02 2:24 God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
02 2:25 God looked upon the Israelites, and God took notice of them.
02 3:1 Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
02 3:2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed.
02 3:3 Then Moses said, "I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up."
02 3:4 When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am."
02 3:5 Then he said, "Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
02 3:6 He said further, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
02 3:7 Then the LORD said, "I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings,
02 3:8 and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
02 3:9 The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
02 3:10 So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."
02 3:11 But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
02 3:12 He said, "I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain."
02 3:13 But Moses said to God, "If I come to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
02 3:14 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." He said further, "Thus you shall say to the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
02 3:15 God also said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you': This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.
02 3:16 Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have given heed to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt.
02 3:17 I declare that I will bring you up out of the misery of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.'
02 3:18 They will listen to your voice; and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; let us now go a three days' journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
02 3:19 I know, however, that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
02 3:20 So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will perform in it; after that he will let you go.
02 3:21 I will bring this people into such favor with the Egyptians that, when you go, you will not go empty-handed;
02 3:22 each woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman living in the neighbor's house for jewelry of silver and of gold, and clothing, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters; and so you shall plunder the Egyptians."
02 4:1 Then Moses answered, "But suppose they do not believe me or listen to me, but say, 'The LORD did not appear to you.'"
02 4:2 The LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A staff."
02 4:3 And he said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw the staff on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses drew back from it.
02 4:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Reach out your hand, and seize it by the tail"--so he reached out his hand and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand--
02 4:5 "so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
02 4:6 Again, the LORD said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." He put his hand into his cloak; and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
02 4:7 Then God said, "Put your hand back into your cloak"--so he put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored like the rest of his body--
02 4:8 "If they will not believe you or heed the first sign, they may believe the second sign.
02 4:9 If they will not believe even these two signs or heed you, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
02 4:10 But Moses said to the LORD, "O my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor even now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
02 4:11 Then the LORD said to him, "Who gives speech to mortals? Who makes them mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
02 4:12 Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak."
02 4:13 But he said, "O my Lord, please send someone else."
02 4:14 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, "What of your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know that he can speak fluently; even now he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you his heart will be glad.
02 4:15 You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.
02 4:16 He indeed shall speak for you to the people; he shall serve as a mouth for you, and you shall serve as God for him.
02 4:17 Take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs."
02 4:18 Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, "Please let me go back to my kindred in Egypt and see whether they are still living." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
02 4:19 The LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt; for all those who were seeking your life are dead."
02 4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey and went back to the land of Egypt; and Moses carried the staff of God in his hand.
02 4:21 And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
02 4:22 Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD: Israel is my firstborn son.
02 4:23 I said to you, "Let my son go that he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.'"
02 4:24 On the way, at a place where they spent the night, the LORD met him and tried to kill him.
02 4:25 But Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin, and touched Moses' feet with it, and said, "Truly you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
02 4:26 So he let him alone. It was then she said, "A bridegroom of blood by circumcision."
02 4:27 The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went; and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
02 4:28 Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.
02 4:29 Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites.
02 4:30 Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.
02 4:31 The people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had given heed to the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
02 5:1 Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.'"
02 5:2 But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should heed him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go."
02 5:3 Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us; let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or he will fall upon us with pestilence or sword."
02 5:4 But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Get to your labors!"
02 5:5 Pharaoh continued, "Now they are more numerous than the people of the land and yet you want them to stop working!"
02 5:6 That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, as well as their supervisors,
02 5:7 "You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
02 5:8 But you shall require of them the same quantity of bricks as they have made previously; do not diminish it, for they are lazy; that is why they cry, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'
02 5:9 Let heavier work be laid on them; then they will labor at it and pay no attention to deceptive words."
02 5:10 So the taskmasters and the supervisors of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw.
02 5:11 Go and get straw yourselves, wherever you can find it; but your work will not be lessened in the least.'"
02 5:12 So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.
02 5:13 The taskmasters were urgent, saying, "Complete your work, the same daily assignment as when you were given straw."
02 5:14 And the supervisors of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, "Why did you not finish the required quantity of bricks yesterday and today, as you did before?"
02 5:15 Then the Israelite supervisors came to Pharaoh and cried, "Why do you treat your servants like this?
02 5:16 No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' Look how your servants are beaten! You are unjust to your own people."
02 5:17 He said, "You are lazy, lazy; that is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
02 5:18 Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, but you shall still deliver the same number of bricks."
02 5:19 The Israelite supervisors saw that they were in trouble when they were told, "You shall not lessen your daily number of bricks."
02 5:20 As they left Pharaoh, they came upon Moses and Aaron who were waiting to meet them.
02 5:21 They said to them, "The LORD look upon you and judge! You have brought us into bad odor with Pharaoh and his officials, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
02 5:22 Then Moses turned again to the LORD and said, "O LORD, why have you mistreated this people? Why did you ever send me?
02 5:23 Since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has mistreated this people, and you have done nothing at all to deliver your people."
02 6:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh: Indeed, by a mighty hand he will let them go; by a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land."
02 6:2 God also spoke to Moses and said to him: "I am the LORD.
02 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name 'The LORD' I did not make myself known to them.
02 6:4 I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they resided as aliens.
02 6:5 I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians are holding as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
02 6:6 Say therefore to the Israelites, 'I am the LORD, and I will free you from the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver you from slavery to them. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
02 6:7 I will take you as my people, and I will be your God. You shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has freed you from the burdens of the Egyptians.
02 6:8 I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'"
02 6:9 Moses told this to the Israelites; but they would not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and their cruel slavery.
02 6:10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses,
02 6:11 "Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land."
02 6:12 But Moses spoke to the LORD, "The Israelites have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh listen to me, poor speaker that I am?"
02 6:13 Thus the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them orders regarding the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, charging them to free the Israelites from the land of Egypt.
02 6:14 The following are the heads of their ancestral houses: the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
02 6:15 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
02 6:16 The following are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogies: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, and the length of Levi's life was one hundred thirty-seven years.
02 6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their families.
02 6:18 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, and the length of Kohath's life was one hundred thirty-three years.
02 6:19 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their genealogies.
02 6:20 Amram married Jochebed his father's sister and she bore him Aaron and Moses, and the length of Amram's life was one hundred thirty-seven years.
02 6:21 The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
02 6:22 The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
02 6:23 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
02 6:24 The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
02 6:25 Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the ancestral houses of the Levites by their families.
02 6:26 It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, company by company."
02 6:27 It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, the same Moses and Aaron.
02 6:28 On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
02 6:29 he said to him, "I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I am speaking to you."
02 6:30 But Moses said in the LORD's presence, "Since I am a poor speaker, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"
02 7:1 The LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
02 7:2 You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land.
02 7:3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
02 7:4 When Pharaoh does not listen to you, I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my people the Israelites, company by company, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
02 7:5 The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them."
02 7:6 Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
02 7:7 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02 7:8 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
02 7:9 "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a wonder,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.'"
02 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the LORD had commanded; Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
02 7:11 Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.
02 7:12 Each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes; but Aaron's staff swallowed up theirs.
02 7:13 Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
02 7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; stand by at the river bank to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.
02 7:16 Say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you to say, "Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness." But until now you have not listened.'
02 7:17 Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD." See, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall be turned to blood.
02 7:18 The fish in the river shall die, the river itself shall stink, and the Egyptians shall be unable to drink water from the Nile.'"
02 7:19 The LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt--over its rivers, its canals, and its ponds, and all its pools of water--so that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
02 7:20 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and of his officials he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the river, and all the water in the river was turned into blood,
02 7:21 and the fish in the river died. The river stank so that the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout the whole land of Egypt.
02 7:22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the LORD had said.
02 7:23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
02 7:24 And all the Egyptians had to dig along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the river.
02 7:25 Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
02 8:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02 8:2 If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
02 8:3 The river shall swarm with frogs; they shall come up into your palace, into your bedchamber and your bed, and into the houses of your officials and of your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
02 8:4 The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your officials.'"
02 8:5 And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"
02 8:6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
02 8:7 But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs up on the land of Egypt.
02 8:8 Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, "Pray to the LORD to take away the frogs from me and my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
02 8:9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "Kindly tell me when I am to pray for you and for your officials and for your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile."
02 8:10 And he said, "Tomorrow." Moses said, "As you say! So that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God,
02 8:11 the frogs shall leave you and your houses and your officials and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile."
02 8:12 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried out to the LORD concerning the frogs that he had brought upon Pharaoh.
02 8:13 And the LORD did as Moses requested: the frogs died in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
02 8:14 And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
02 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
02 8:16 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.'"
02 8:17 And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.
02 8:18 The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on both humans and animals.
02 8:19 And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God!" But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
02 8:20 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02 8:21 For if you will not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, and your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies; so also the land where they live.
02 8:22 But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people live, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I the LORD am in this land.
02 8:23 Thus I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign shall appear tomorrow.'"
02 8:24 The LORD did so, and great swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his officials' houses; in all of Egypt the land was ruined because of the flies.
02 8:25 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."
02 8:26 But Moses said, "It would not be right to do so; for the sacrifices that we offer to the LORD our God are offensive to the Egyptians. If we offer in the sight of the Egyptians sacrifices that are offensive to them, will they not stone us?
02 8:27 We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he commands us."
02 8:28 So Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, provided you do not go very far away. Pray for me."
02 8:29 Then Moses said, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his officials, and from his people; only do not let Pharaoh again deal falsely by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
02 8:30 So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
02 8:31 And the LORD did as Moses asked: he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his officials, and from his people; not one remained.
02 8:32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and would not let the people go.
02 9:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02 9:2 For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them,
02 9:3 the hand of the LORD will strike with a deadly pestilence your livestock in the field: the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
02 9:4 But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing shall die of all that belongs to the Israelites.'"
02 9:5 The LORD set a time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
02 9:6 And on the next day the LORD did so; all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but of the livestock of the Israelites not one died.
02 9:7 Pharaoh inquired and found that not one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the people go.
02 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw it in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
02 9:9 It shall become fine dust all over the land of Egypt, and shall cause festering boils on humans and animals throughout the whole land of Egypt."
02 9:10 So they took soot from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw it in the air, and it caused festering boils on humans and animals.
02 9:11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils afflicted the magicians as well as all the Egyptians.
02 9:12 But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
02 9:13 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02 9:14 For this time I will send all my plagues upon you yourself, and upon your officials, and upon your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
02 9:15 For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
02 9:16 But this is why I have let you live: to show you my power, and to make my name resound through all the earth.
02 9:17 You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go.
02 9:18 Tomorrow at this time I will cause the heaviest hail to fall that has ever fallen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
02 9:19 Send, therefore, and have your livestock and everything that you have in the open field brought to a secure place; every human or animal that is in the open field and is not brought under shelter will die when the hail comes down upon them.'"
02 9:20 Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried their slaves and livestock off to a secure place.
02 9:21 Those who did not regard the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the open field.
02 9:22 The LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that hail may fall on the whole land of Egypt, on humans and animals and all the plants of the field in the land of Egypt."
02 9:23 Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire came down on the earth. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;
02 9:24 there was hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of it, such heavy hail as had never fallen in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
02 9:25 The hail struck down everything that was in the open field throughout all the land of Egypt, both human and animal; the hail also struck down all the plants of the field, and shattered every tree in the field.
02 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.
02 9:27 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
02 9:28 Pray to the LORD! Enough of God's thunder and hail! I will let you go; you need stay no longer."
02 9:29 Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
02 9:30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."
02 9:31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
02 9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.)
02 9:33 So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and stretched out his hands to the LORD; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.
02 9:34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned once more and hardened his heart, he and his officials.
02 9:35 So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
02 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his officials, in order that I may show these signs of mine among them,
02 10:2 and that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I have made fools of the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them--so that you may know that I am the LORD."
02 10:3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02 10:4 For if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country.
02 10:5 They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They shall devour the last remnant left you after the hail, and they shall devour every tree of yours that grows in the field.
02 10:6 They shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your officials and of all the Egyptians--something that neither your parents nor your grandparents have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'" Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
02 10:7 Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long shall this fellow be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God; do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"
02 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, worship the LORD your God! But which ones are to go?"
02 10:9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, because we have the LORD's festival to celebrate."
02 10:10 He said to them, "The LORD indeed will be with you, if ever I let your little ones go with you! Plainly, you have some evil purpose in mind.
02 10:11 No, never! Your men may go and worship the LORD, for that is what you are asking." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
02 10:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, so that the locusts may come upon it and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left."
02 10:13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; when morning came, the east wind had brought the locusts.
02 10:14 The locusts came upon all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever shall be again.
02 10:15 They covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was black; and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; nothing green was left, no tree, no plant in the field, in all the land of Egypt.
02 10:16 Pharaoh hurriedly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
02 10:17 Do forgive my sin just this once, and pray to the LORD your God that at the least he remove this deadly thing from me."
02 10:18 So he went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
02 10:19 The LORD changed the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
02 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
02 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt."
02 10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was dense darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
02 10:23 People could not see one another, and for three days they could not move from where they were; but all the Israelites had light where they lived.
02 10:24 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses, and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Only your flocks and your herds shall remain behind. Even your children may go with you."
02 10:25 But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to sacrifice to the LORD our God.
02 10:26 Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must choose some of them for the worship of the LORD our God, and we will not know what to use to worship the LORD until we arrive there."
02 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.
02 10:28 Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Take care that you do not see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die."
02 10:29 Moses said, "Just as you say! I will never see your face again."
02 11:1 The LORD said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go from here; indeed, when he lets you go, he will drive you away.
02 11:2 Tell the people that every man is to ask his neighbor and every woman is to ask her neighbor for objects of silver and gold."
02 11:3 The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was a man of great importance in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's officials and in the sight of the people.
02 11:4 Moses said, "Thus says the LORD: About midnight I will go out through Egypt.
02 11:5 Every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the female slave who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
02 11:6 Then there will be a loud cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as has never been or will ever be again.
02 11:7 But not a dog shall growl at any of the Israelites--not at people, not at animals--so that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
02 11:8 Then all these officials of yours shall come down to me, and bow low to me, saying, 'Leave us, you and all the people who follow you.' After that I will leave." And in hot anger he left Pharaoh.
02 11:9 The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, in order that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
02 11:10 Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.
02 12:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:
02 12:2 This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you.
02 12:3 Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household.
02 12:4 If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it.
02 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
02 12:6 You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight.
02 12:7 They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
02 12:8 They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
02 12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs.
02 12:10 You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
02 12:11 This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD.
02 12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.
02 12:13 The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
02 12:14 This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.
02 12:15 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day shall be cut off from Israel.
02 12:16 On the first day you shall hold a solemn assembly, and on the seventh day a solemn assembly; no work shall be done on those days; only what everyone must eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
02 12:17 You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your companies out of the land of Egypt: you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.
02 12:18 In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day, you shall eat unleavened bread.
02 12:19 For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether an alien or a native of the land.
02 12:20 You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat unleavened bread.
02 12:21 Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go, select lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover lamb.
02 12:22 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood in the basin. None of you shall go outside the door of your house until morning.
02 12:23 For the LORD will pass through to strike down the Egyptians; when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over that door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down.
02 12:24 You shall observe this rite as a perpetual ordinance for you and your children.
02 12:25 When you come to the land that the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this observance.
02 12:26 And when your children ask you, 'What do you mean by this observance?'
02 12:27 you shall say, 'It is the passover sacrifice to the LORD, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he struck down the Egyptians but spared our houses.'" And the people bowed down and worshiped.
02 12:28 The Israelites went and did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02 12:29 At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
02 12:30 Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his officials and all the Egyptians; and there was a loud cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
02 12:31 Then he summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, "Rise up, go away from my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD, as you said.
02 12:32 Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone. And bring a blessing on me too!"
02 12:33 The Egyptians urged the people to hasten their departure from the land, for they said, "We shall all be dead."
02 12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
02 12:35 The Israelites had done as Moses told them; they had asked the Egyptians for jewelry of silver and gold, and for clothing,
02 12:36 and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And so they plundered the Egyptians.
02 12:37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.
02 12:38 A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers, both flocks and herds.
02 12:39 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt; it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
02 12:40 The time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.
02 12:41 At the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the companies of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
02 12:42 That was for the LORD a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. That same night is a vigil to be kept for the LORD by all the Israelites throughout their generations.
02 12:43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,
02 12:44 but any slave who has been purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised;
02 12:45 no bound or hired servant may eat of it.
02 12:46 It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the animal outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.
02 12:47 The whole congregation of Israel shall celebrate it.
02 12:48 If an alien who resides with you wants to celebrate the passover to the LORD, all his males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to celebrate it; he shall be regarded as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it;
02 12:49 there shall be one law for the native and for the alien who resides among you.
02 12:50 All the Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02 12:51 That very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, company by company.
02 13:1 The LORD said to Moses:
02 13:2 Consecrate to me all the firstborn; whatever is the first to open the womb among the Israelites, of human beings and animals, is mine.
02 13:3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, because the LORD brought you out from there by strength of hand; no leavened bread shall be eaten.
02 13:4 Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.
02 13:5 When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this observance in this month.
02 13:6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival to the LORD.
02 13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your possession, and no leaven shall be seen among you in all your territory.
02 13:8 You shall tell your child on that day, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
02 13:9 It shall serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the teaching of the LORD may be on your lips; for with a strong hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
02 13:10 You shall keep this ordinance at its proper time from year to year.
02 13:11 "When the LORD has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your ancestors, and has given it to you,
02 13:12 you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your livestock that are males shall be the LORD's.
02 13:13 But every firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. Every firstborn male among your children you shall redeem.
02 13:14 When in the future your child asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall answer, 'By strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
02 13:15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human firstborn to the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD every male that first opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
02 13:16 It shall serve as a sign on your hand and as an emblem on your forehead that by strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."
02 13:17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was nearer; for God thought, "If the people face war, they may change their minds and return to Egypt."
02 13:18 So God led the people by the roundabout way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for battle.
02 13:19 And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph who had required a solemn oath of the Israelites, saying, "God will surely take notice of you, and then you must carry my bones with you from here."
02 13:20 They set out from Succoth, and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
02 13:21 The LORD went in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day, to lead them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, so that they might travel by day and by night.
02 13:22 Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
02 14:1 Then the LORD said to Moses:
02 14:2 Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall camp opposite it, by the sea.
02 14:3 Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has closed in on them.'
02 14:4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, so that I will gain glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD. And they did so.
02 14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the minds of Pharaoh and his officials were changed toward the people, and they said, "What have we done, letting Israel leave our service?"
02 14:6 So he had his chariot made ready, and took his army with him;
02 14:7 he took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
02 14:8 The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out boldly.
02 14:9 The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, his chariot drivers and his army; they overtook them camped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
02 14:10 As Pharaoh drew near, the Israelites looked back, and there were the Egyptians advancing on them. In great fear the Israelites cried out to the LORD.
02 14:11 They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?
02 14:12 Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, 'Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
02 14:13 But Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid, stand firm, and see the deliverance that the LORD will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you shall never see again.
02 14:14 The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to keep still."
02 14:15 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.
02 14:16 But you lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the Israelites may go into the sea on dry ground.
02 14:17 Then I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and so I will gain glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his chariot drivers.
02 14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gained glory for myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his chariot drivers."
02 14:19 The angel of God who was going before the Israelite army moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and took its place behind them.
02 14:20 It came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel. And so the cloud was there with the darkness, and it lit up the night; one did not come near the other all night.
02 14:21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and the waters were divided.
02 14:22 The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.
02 14:23 The Egyptians pursued, and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and chariot drivers.
02 14:24 At the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and cloud looked down upon the Egyptian army, and threw the Egyptian army into panic.
02 14:25 He clogged their chariot wheels so that they turned with difficulty. The Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the Israelites, for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt."
02 14:26 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot drivers."
02 14:27 So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to its normal depth. As the Egyptians fled before it, the LORD tossed the Egyptians into the sea.
02 14:28 The waters returned and covered the chariots and the chariot drivers, the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not one of them remained.
02 14:29 But the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.
02 14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
02 14:31 Israel saw the great work that the LORD did against the Egyptians. So the people feared the LORD and believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.
02 15:1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: "I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he has thrown into the sea.
02 15:2 The LORD is my strength and my might, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.
02 15:3 The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
02 15:4 "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he cast into the sea; his picked officers were sunk in the Red Sea.
02 15:5 The floods covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone.
02 15:6 Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power--your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.
02 15:7 In the greatness of your majesty you overthrew your adversaries; you sent out your fury, it consumed them like stubble.
02 15:8 At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up, the floods stood up in a heap; the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
02 15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
02 15:10 You blew with your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02 15:11 "Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, doing wonders?
02 15:12 You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.
02 15:13 "In your steadfast love you led the people whom you redeemed; you guided them by your strength to your holy abode.
02 15:14 The peoples heard, they trembled; pangs seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
02 15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; trembling seized the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
02 15:16 Terror and dread fell upon them; by the might of your arm, they became still as a stone until your people, O LORD, passed by, until the people whom you acquired passed by.
02 15:17 You brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your own possession, the place, O LORD, that you made your abode, the sanctuary, O LORD, that your hands have established.
02 15:18 The LORD will reign forever and ever."
02 15:19 When the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his chariot drivers went into the sea, the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
02 15:20 Then the prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.
02 15:21 And Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he has thrown into the sea."
02 15:22 Then Moses ordered Israel to set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
02 15:23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter. That is why it was called Marah.
02 15:24 And the people complained against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
02 15:25 He cried out to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a piece of wood; he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he put them to the test.
02 15:26 He said, "If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in his sight, and give heed to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD who heals you."
02 15:27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they camped there by the water.
02 16:1 The whole congregation of the Israelites set out from Elim; and Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
02 16:2 The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
02 16:3 The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
02 16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not.
02 16:5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days."
02 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
02 16:7 and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaining against the LORD. For what are we, that you complain against us?"
02 16:8 And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the LORD has heard the complaining that you utter against him--what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the LORD."
02 16:9 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, 'Draw near to the LORD, for he has heard your complaining.'"
02 16:10 And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
02 16:11 The LORD spoke to Moses and said,
02 16:12 "I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
02 16:13 In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
02 16:14 When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground.
02 16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
02 16:16 This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Gather as much of it as each of you needs, an omer to a person according to the number of persons, all providing for those in their own tents.'"
02 16:17 The Israelites did so, some gathering more, some less.
02 16:18 But when they measured it with an omer, those who gathered much had nothing over, and those who gathered little had no shortage; they gathered as much as each of them needed.
02 16:19 And Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it over until morning."
02 16:20 But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses was angry with them.
02 16:21 Morning by morning they gathered it, as much as each needed; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
02 16:22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers apiece. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
02 16:23 he said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.'"
02 16:24 So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it.
02 16:25 Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
02 16:26 Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none."
02 16:27 On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.
02 16:28 The LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and instructions?
02 16:29 See! The LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your place on the seventh day."
02 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
02 16:31 The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
02 16:32 Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02 16:33 And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations."
02 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for safekeeping.
02 16:35 The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
02 16:36 An omer is a tenth of an ephah.
02 17:1 From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
02 17:2 The people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
02 17:3 But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?"
02 17:4 So Moses cried out to the LORD, "What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
02 17:5 The LORD said to Moses, "Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
02 17:6 I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink." Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02 17:7 He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
02 17:8 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
02 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some men for us and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
02 17:10 So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
02 17:11 Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
02 17:12 But Moses' hands grew weary; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the sun set.
02 17:13 And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.
02 17:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this as a reminder in a book and recite it in the hearing of Joshua: I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
02 17:15 And Moses built an altar and called it, The LORD is my banner.
02 17:16 He said, "A hand upon the banner of the LORD! The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
02 18:1 Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02 18:2 After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro took her back,
02 18:3 along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, "I have been an alien in a foreign land"),
02 18:4 and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh").
02 18:5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came into the wilderness where Moses was encamped at the mountain of God, bringing Moses' sons and wife to him.
02 18:6 He sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, with your wife and her two sons."
02 18:7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed down and kissed him; each asked after the other's welfare, and they went into the tent.
02 18:8 Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had beset them on the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
02 18:9 Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the Egyptians.
02 18:10 Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh.
02 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because he delivered the people from the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them."
02 18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
02 18:13 The next day Moses sat as judge for the people, while the people stood around him from morning until evening.
02 18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?"
02 18:15 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
02 18:16 When they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make known to them the statutes and instructions of God."
02 18:17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
02 18:18 You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people with you. For the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.
02 18:19 Now listen to me. I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You should represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases before God;
02 18:20 teach them the statutes and instructions and make known to them the way they are to go and the things they are to do.
02 18:21 You should also look for able men among all the people, men who fear God, are trustworthy, and hate dishonest gain; set such men over them as officers over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
02 18:22 Let them sit as judges for the people at all times; let them bring every important case to you, but decide every minor case themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
02 18:23 If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people will go to their home in peace."
02 18:24 So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
02 18:25 Moses chose able men from all Israel and appointed them as heads over the people, as officers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
02 18:26 And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses, but any minor case they decided themselves.
02 18:27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went off to his own country.
02 19:1 On the third new moon after the Israelites had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day, they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
02 19:2 They had journeyed from Rephidim, entered the wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness; Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
02 19:3 Then Moses went up to God; the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the Israelites:
02 19:4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
02 19:5 Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession out of all the peoples. Indeed, the whole earth is mine,
02 19:6 but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the Israelites."
02 19:7 So Moses came, summoned the elders of the people, and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
02 19:8 The people all answered as one: "Everything that the LORD has spoken we will do." Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
02 19:9 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you and so trust you ever after." When Moses had told the words of the people to the LORD,
02 19:10 the LORD said to Moses: "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
02 19:11 and prepare for the third day, because on the third day the LORD will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
02 19:12 You shall set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Be careful not to go up the mountain or to touch the edge of it. Any who touch the mountain shall be put to death.
02 19:13 No hand shall touch them, but they shall be stoned or shot with arrows; whether animal or human being, they shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they may go up on the mountain."
02 19:14 So Moses went down from the mountain to the people. He consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes.
02 19:15 And he said to the people, "Prepare for the third day; do not go near a woman."
02 19:16 On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, as well as a thick cloud on the mountain, and a blast of a trumpet so loud that all the people who were in the camp trembled.
02 19:17 Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. They took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
02 19:18 Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the LORD had descended upon it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, while the whole mountain shook violently.
02 19:19 As the blast of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses would speak and God would answer him in thunder.
02 19:20 When the LORD descended upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, the LORD summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
02 19:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people not to break through to the LORD to look; otherwise many of them will perish.
02 19:22 Even the priests who approach the LORD must consecrate themselves or the LORD will break out against them."
02 19:23 Moses said to the LORD, "The people are not permitted to come up to Mount Sinai; for you yourself warned us, saying, 'Set limits around the mountain and keep it holy.'"
02 19:24 The LORD said to him, "Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you; but do not let either the priests or the people break through to come up to the LORD; otherwise he will break out against them."
02 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
02 20:1 Then God spoke all these words:
02 20:2 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;
02 20:3 you shall have no other gods before me.
02 20:4 You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
02 20:5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me,
02 20:6 but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.
02 20:7 You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.
02 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.
02 20:9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
02 20:10 But the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work--you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.
02 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.
02 20:12 Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
02 20:13 You shall not murder.
02 20:14 You shall not commit adultery.
02 20:15 You shall not steal.
02 20:16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
02 20:17 You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
02 20:18 When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance,
02 20:19 and said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die."
02 20:20 Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin."
02 20:21 Then the people stood at a distance, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
02 20:22 The LORD said to Moses: Thus you shall say to the Israelites: "You have seen for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven.
02 20:23 You shall not make gods of silver alongside me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.
02 20:24 You need make for me only an altar of earth and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your offerings of well-being, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.
02 20:25 But if you make for me an altar of stone, do not build it of hewn stones; for if you use a chisel upon it you profane it.
02 20:26 You shall not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness may not be exposed on it."
02 21:1 These are the ordinances that you shall set before them:
02 21:2 When you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, but in the seventh he shall go out a free person, without debt.
02 21:3 If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
02 21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out alone.
02 21:5 But if the slave declares, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out a free person,"
02 21:6 then his master shall bring him before God. He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.
02 21:7 When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.
02 21:8 If she does not please her master, who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed; he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt unfairly with her.
02 21:9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
02 21:10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.
02 21:11 And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out without debt, without payment of money.
02 21:12 Whoever strikes a person mortally shall be put to death.
02 21:13 If it was not premeditated, but came about by an act of God, then I will appoint for you a place to which the killer may flee.
02 21:14 But if someone willfully attacks and kills another by treachery, you shall take the killer from my altar for execution.
02 21:15 Whoever strikes father or mother shall be put to death.
02 21:16 Whoever kidnaps a person, whether that person has been sold or is still held in possession, shall be put to death.
02 21:17 Whoever curses father or mother shall be put to death.
02 21:18 When individuals quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or fist so that the injured party, though not dead, is confined to bed,
02 21:19 but recovers and walks around outside with the help of a staff, then the assailant shall be free of liability, except to pay for the loss of time, and to arrange for full recovery.
02 21:20 When a slaveowner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished.
02 21:21 But if the slave survives a day or two, there is no punishment; for the slave is the owner's property.
02 21:22 When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman's husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine.
02 21:23 If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life,
02 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02 21:25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
02 21:26 When a slaveowner strikes the eye of a male or female slave, destroying it, the owner shall let the slave go, a free person, to compensate for the eye.
02 21:27 If the owner knocks out a tooth of a male or female slave, the slave shall be let go, a free person, to compensate for the tooth.
02 21:28 When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.
02 21:29 If the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not restrained it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
02 21:30 If a ransom is imposed on the owner, then the owner shall pay whatever is imposed for the redemption of the victim's life.
02 21:31 If it gores a boy or a girl, the owner shall be dealt with according to this same rule.
02 21:32 If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall pay to the slaveowner thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
02 21:33 If someone leaves a pit open, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
02 21:34 the owner of the pit shall make restitution, giving money to its owner, but keeping the dead animal.
02 21:35 If someone's ox hurts the ox of another, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the price of it; and the dead animal they shall also divide.
02 21:36 But if it was known that the ox was accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not restrained it, the owner shall restore ox for ox, but keep the dead animal.
02 22:1 When someone steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, the thief shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
02 22:2 If a thief is found breaking in, and is beaten to death, no bloodguilt is incurred;
02 22:3 but if it happens after sunrise, bloodguilt is incurred. The thief shall make restitution, but if unable to do so, shall be sold for the theft.
02 22:4 When the animal, whether ox or donkey or sheep, is found alive in the thief's possession, the thief shall pay double.
02 22:5 When someone causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over, or lets livestock loose to graze in someone else's field, restitution shall be made from the best in the owner's field or vineyard.
02 22:6 When fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed, the one who started the fire shall make full restitution.
02 22:7 When someone delivers to a neighbor money or goods for safekeeping, and they are stolen from the neighbor's house, then the thief, if caught, shall pay double.
02 22:8 If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house shall be brought before God, to determine whether or not the owner had laid hands on the neighbor's goods.
02 22:9 In any case of disputed ownership involving ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or any other loss, of which one party says, "This is mine," the case of both parties shall come before God; the one whom God condemns shall pay double to the other.
02 22:10 When someone delivers to another a donkey, ox, sheep, or any other animal for safekeeping, and it dies or is injured or is carried off, without anyone seeing it,
02 22:11 an oath before the LORD shall decide between the two of them that the one has not laid hands on the property of the other; the owner shall accept the oath, and no restitution shall be made.
02 22:12 But if it was stolen, restitution shall be made to its owner.
02 22:13 If it was mangled by beasts, let it be brought as evidence; restitution shall not be made for the mangled remains.
02 22:14 When someone borrows an animal from another and it is injured or dies, the owner not being present, full restitution shall be made.
02 22:15 If the owner was present, there shall be no restitution; if it was hired, only the hiring fee is due.
02 22:16 When a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged to be married, and lies with her, he shall give the bride-price for her and make her his wife.
02 22:17 But if her father refuses to give her to him, he shall pay an amount equal to the bride-price for virgins.
02 22:18 You shall not permit a female sorcerer to live.
02 22:19 Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death.
02 22:20 Whoever sacrifices to any god, other than the LORD alone, shall be devoted to destruction.
02 22:21 You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
02 22:22 You shall not abuse any widow or orphan.
02 22:23 If you do abuse them, when they cry out to me, I will surely heed their cry;
02 22:24 my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children orphans.
02 22:25 If you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, you shall not deal with them as a creditor; you shall not exact interest from them.
02 22:26 If you take your neighbor's cloak in pawn, you shall restore it before the sun goes down;
02 22:27 for it may be your neighbor's only clothing to use as cover; in what else shall that person sleep? And if your neighbor cries out to me, I will listen, for I am compassionate.
02 22:28 You shall not revile God, or curse a leader of your people.
02 22:29 You shall not delay to make offerings from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me.
02 22:30 You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall remain with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.
02 22:31 You shall be people consecrated to me; therefore you shall not eat any meat that is mangled by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.
02 23:1 You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with the wicked to act as a malicious witness.
02 23:2 You shall not follow a majority in wrongdoing; when you bear witness in a lawsuit, you shall not side with the majority so as to pervert justice;
02 23:3 nor shall you be partial to the poor in a lawsuit.
02 23:4 When you come upon your enemy's ox or donkey going astray, you shall bring it back.
02 23:5 When you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden and you would hold back from setting it free, you must help to set it free.
02 23:6 You shall not pervert the justice due to your poor in their lawsuits.
02 23:7 Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and those in the right, for I will not acquit the guilty.
02 23:8 You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the officials, and subverts the cause of those who are in the right.
02 23:9 You shall not oppress a resident alien; you know the heart of an alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
02 23:10 For six years you shall sow your land and gather in its yield;
02 23:11 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the wild animals may eat. You shall do the same with your vineyard, and with your olive orchard.
02 23:12 Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest, so that your ox and your donkey may have relief, and your homeborn slave and the resident alien may be refreshed.
02 23:13 Be attentive to all that I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.
02 23:14 Three times in the year you shall hold a festival for me.
02 23:15 You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread; as I commanded you, you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. No one shall appear before me empty-handed.
02 23:16 You shall observe the festival of harvest, of the first fruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. You shall observe the festival of ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in from the field the fruit of your labor.
02 23:17 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
02 23:18 You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the fat of my festival remain until the morning.
02 23:19 The choicest of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
02 23:20 I am going to send an angel in front of you, to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.
02 23:21 Be attentive to him and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him.
02 23:22 But if you listen attentively to his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.
02 23:23 When my angel goes in front of you, and brings you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I blot them out,
02 23:24 you shall not bow down to their gods, or worship them, or follow their practices, but you shall utterly demolish them and break their pillars in pieces.
02 23:25 You shall worship the LORD your God, and I will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from among you.
02 23:26 No one shall miscarry or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
02 23:27 I will send my terror in front of you, and will throw into confusion all the people against whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
02 23:28 And I will send the pestilence in front of you, which shall drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you.
02 23:29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, or the land would become desolate and the wild animals would multiply against you.
02 23:30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and possess the land.
02 23:31 I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates; for I will hand over to you the inhabitants of the land, and you shall drive them out before you.
02 23:32 You shall make no covenant with them and their gods.
02 23:33 They shall not live in your land, or they will make you sin against me; for if you worship their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
02 24:1 Then he said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance.
02 24:2 Moses alone shall come near the LORD; but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him."
02 24:3 Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, "All the words that the LORD has spoken we will do."
02 24:4 And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.
02 24:5 He sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed oxen as offerings of well-being to the LORD.
02 24:6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he dashed against the altar.
02 24:7 Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient."
02 24:8 Moses took the blood and dashed it on the people, and said, "See the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words."
02 24:9 Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,
02 24:10 and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.
02 24:11 God did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; also they beheld God, and they ate and drank.
02 24:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there; and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction."
02 24:13 So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.
02 24:14 To the elders he had said, "Wait here for us, until we come to you again; for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them."
02 24:15 Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
02 24:16 The glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud.
02 24:17 Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.
02 24:18 Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.
02 25:1 The LORD said to Moses:
02 25:2 Tell the Israelites to take for me an offering; from all whose hearts prompt them to give you shall receive the offering for me.
02 25:3 This is the offering that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze,
02 25:4 blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine linen, goats' hair,
02 25:5 tanned rams' skins, fine leather, acacia wood,
02 25:6 oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
02 25:7 onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and for the breastpiece.
02 25:8 And have them make me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them.
02 25:9 In accordance with all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.
02 25:10 They shall make an ark of acacia wood; it shall be two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02 25:11 You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and outside you shall overlay it, and you shall make a molding of gold upon it all around.
02 25:12 You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet, two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side.
02 25:13 You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
02 25:14 And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, by which to carry the ark.
02 25:15 The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.
02 25:16 You shall put into the ark the covenant that I shall give you.
02 25:17 Then you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its width.
02 25:18 You shall make two cherubim of gold; you shall make them of hammered work, at the two ends of the mercy seat.
02 25:19 Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other; of one piece with the mercy seat you shall make the cherubim at its two ends.
02 25:20 The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings. They shall face one to another; the faces of the cherubim shall be turned toward the mercy seat.
02 25:21 You shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you shall put the covenant that I shall give you.
02 25:22 There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the covenant, I will deliver to you all my commands for the Israelites.
02 25:23 You shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02 25:24 You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold around it.
02 25:25 You shall make around it a rim a handbreadth wide, and a molding of gold around the rim.
02 25:26 You shall make for it four rings of gold, and fasten the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
02 25:27 The rings that hold the poles used for carrying the table shall be close to the rim.
02 25:28 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with these.
02 25:29 You shall make its plates and dishes for incense, and its flagons and bowls with which to pour drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold.
02 25:30 And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before me always.
02 25:31 You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The base and the shaft of the lampstand shall be made of hammered work; its cups, its calyxes, and its petals shall be of one piece with it;
02 25:32 and there shall be six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it;
02 25:33 three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
02 25:34 On the lampstand itself there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its calyxes and petals.
02 25:35 There shall be a calyx of one piece with it under the first pair of branches, a calyx of one piece with it under the next pair of branches, and a calyx of one piece with it under the last pair of branches--so for the six branches that go out of the lampstand.
02 25:36 Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole of it one hammered piece of pure gold.
02 25:37 You shall make the seven lamps for it; and the lamps shall be set up so as to give light on the space in front of it.
02 25:38 Its snuffers and trays shall be of pure gold.
02 25:39 It, and all these utensils, shall be made from a talent of pure gold.
02 25:40 And see that you make them according to the pattern for them, which is being shown you on the mountain.
02 26:1 Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns; you shall make them with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
02 26:2 The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains shall be of the same size.
02 26:3 Five curtains shall be joined to one another; and the other five curtains shall be joined to one another.
02 26:4 You shall make loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; and likewise you shall make loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.
02 26:5 You shall make fifty loops on the one curtain, and you shall make fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite one another.
02 26:6 You shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle may be one whole.
02 26:7 You shall also make curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; you shall make eleven curtains.
02 26:8 The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains shall be of the same size.
02 26:9 You shall join five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and the sixth curtain you shall double over at the front of the tent.
02 26:10 You shall make fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in the second set.
02 26:11 You shall make fifty clasps of bronze, and put the clasps into the loops, and join the tent together, so that it may be one whole.
02 26:12 The part that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
02 26:13 The cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of what remains in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle, on this side and that side, to cover it.
02 26:14 You shall make for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and an outer covering of fine leather.
02 26:15 You shall make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
02 26:16 Ten cubits shall be the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the width of each frame.
02 26:17 There shall be two pegs in each frame to fit the frames together; you shall make these for all the frames of the tabernacle.
02 26:18 You shall make the frames for the tabernacle: twenty frames for the south side;
02 26:19 and you shall make forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under the first frame for its two pegs, and two bases under the next frame for its two pegs;
02 26:20 and for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side twenty frames,
02 26:21 and their forty bases of silver, two bases under the first frame, and two bases under the next frame;
02 26:22 and for the rear of the tabernacle westward you shall make six frames.
02 26:23 You shall make two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear;
02 26:24 they shall be separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; it shall be the same with both of them; they shall form the two corners.
02 26:25 And so there shall be eight frames, with their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under the first frame, and two bases under the next frame.
02 26:26 You shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,
02 26:27 and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the side of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
02 26:28 The middle bar, halfway up the frames, shall pass through from end to end.
02 26:29 You shall overlay the frames with gold, and shall make their rings of gold to hold the bars; and you shall overlay the bars with gold.
02 26:30 Then you shall erect the tabernacle according to the plan for it that you were shown on the mountain.
02 26:31 You shall make a curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen; it shall be made with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
02 26:32 You shall hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold, which have hooks of gold and rest on four bases of silver.
02 26:33 You shall hang the curtain under the clasps, and bring the ark of the covenant in there, within the curtain; and the curtain shall separate for you the holy place from the most holy.
02 26:34 You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant in the most holy place.
02 26:35 You shall set the table outside the curtain, and the lampstand on the south side of the tabernacle opposite the table; and you shall put the table on the north side.
02 26:36 You shall make a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework.
02 26:37 You shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five bases of bronze for them.
02 27:1 You shall make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square, and it shall be three cubits high.
02 27:2 You shall make horns for it on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it, and you shall overlay it with bronze.
02 27:3 You shall make pots for it to receive its ashes, and shovels and basins and forks and firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze.
02 27:4 You shall also make for it a grating, a network of bronze; and on the net you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.
02 27:5 You shall set it under the ledge of the altar so that the net shall extend halfway down the altar.
02 27:6 You shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze;
02 27:7 the poles shall be put through the rings, so that the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.
02 27:8 You shall make it hollow, with boards. They shall be made just as you were shown on the mountain.
02 27:9 You shall make the court of the tabernacle. On the south side the court shall have hangings of fine twisted linen one hundred cubits long for that side;
02 27:10 its twenty pillars and their twenty bases shall be of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be of silver.
02 27:11 Likewise for its length on the north side there shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, their pillars twenty and their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be of silver.
02 27:12 For the width of the court on the west side there shall be fifty cubits of hangings, with ten pillars and ten bases.
02 27:13 The width of the court on the front to the east shall be fifty cubits.
02 27:14 There shall be fifteen cubits of hangings on the one side, with three pillars and three bases.
02 27:15 There shall be fifteen cubits of hangings on the other side, with three pillars and three bases.
02 27:16 For the gate of the court there shall be a screen twenty cubits long, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework; it shall have four pillars and with them four bases.
02 27:17 All the pillars around the court shall be banded with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their bases of bronze.
02 27:18 The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, the width fifty, and the height five cubits, with hangings of fine twisted linen and bases of bronze.
02 27:19 All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, and all its pegs and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze.
02 27:20 You shall further command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, so that a lamp may be set up to burn regularly.
02 27:21 In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that is before the covenant, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening to morning before the LORD. It shall be a perpetual ordinance to be observed throughout their generations by the Israelites.
02 28:1 Then bring near to you your brother Aaron, and his sons with him, from among the Israelites, to serve me as priests--Aaron and Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02 28:2 You shall make sacred vestments for the glorious adornment of your brother Aaron.
02 28:3 And you shall speak to all who have ability, whom I have endowed with skill, that they make Aaron's vestments to consecrate him for my priesthood.
02 28:4 These are the vestments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a checkered tunic, a turban, and a sash. When they make these sacred vestments for your brother Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests,
02 28:5 they shall use gold, blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine linen.
02 28:6 They shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen, skillfully worked.
02 28:7 It shall have two shoulder-pieces attached to its two edges, so that it may be joined together.
02 28:8 The decorated band on it shall be of the same workmanship and materials, of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen.
02 28:9 You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel,
02 28:10 six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, in the order of their birth.
02 28:11 As a gem-cutter engraves signets, so you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel; you shall mount them in settings of gold filigree.
02 28:12 You shall set the two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for remembrance.
02 28:13 You shall make settings of gold filigree,
02 28:14 and two chains of pure gold, twisted like cords; and you shall attach the corded chains to the settings.
02 28:15 You shall make a breastpiece of judgment, in skilled work; you shall make it in the style of the ephod; of gold, of blue and purple and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen you shall make it.
02 28:16 It shall be square and doubled, a span in length and a span in width.
02 28:17 You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of carnelian, chrysolite, and emerald shall be the first row;
02 28:18 and the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and a moonstone;
02 28:19 and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
02 28:20 and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be set in gold filigree.
02 28:21 There shall be twelve stones with names corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they shall be like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
02 28:22 You shall make for the breastpiece chains of pure gold, twisted like cords;
02 28:23 and you shall make for the breastpiece two rings of gold, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
02 28:24 You shall put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece;
02 28:25 the two ends of the two cords you shall attach to the two settings, and so attach it in front to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.
02 28:26 You shall make two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
02 28:27 You shall make two rings of gold, and attach them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its joining above the decorated band of the ephod.
02 28:28 The breastpiece shall be bound by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it may lie on the decorated band of the ephod, and so that the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod.
02 28:29 So Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment on his heart when he goes into the holy place, for a continual remembrance before the LORD.
02 28:30 In the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be on Aaron's heart when he goes in before the LORD; thus Aaron shall bear the judgment of the Israelites on his heart before the LORD continually.
02 28:31 You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
02 28:32 It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it, with a woven binding around the opening, like the opening in a coat of mail, so that it may not be torn.
02 28:33 On its lower hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, all around the lower hem, with bells of gold between them all around--
02 28:34 a golden bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the lower hem of the robe.
02 28:35 Aaron shall wear it when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, so that he may not die.
02 28:36 You shall make a rosette of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."
02 28:37 You shall fasten it on the turban with a blue cord; it shall be on the front of the turban.
02 28:38 It shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall take on himself any guilt incurred in the holy offering that the Israelites consecrate as their sacred donations; it shall always be on his forehead, in order that they may find favor before the LORD.
02 28:39 You shall make the checkered tunic of fine linen, and you shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash embroidered with needlework.
02 28:40 For Aaron's sons you shall make tunics and sashes and headdresses; you shall make them for their glorious adornment.
02 28:41 You shall put them on your brother Aaron, and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them, so that they may serve me as priests.
02 28:42 You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh; they shall reach from the hips to the thighs;
02 28:43 Aaron and his sons shall wear them when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place; or they will bring guilt on themselves and die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his descendants after him.
02 29:1 Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, so that they may serve me as priests. Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
02 29:2 and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil. You shall make them of choice wheat flour.
02 29:3 You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, and bring the bull and the two rams.
02 29:4 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.
02 29:5 Then you shall take the vestments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with the decorated band of the ephod;
02 29:6 and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy diadem on the turban.
02 29:7 You shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head and anoint him.
02 29:8 Then you shall bring his sons, and put tunics on them,
02 29:9 and you shall gird them with sashes and tie headdresses on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual ordinance. You shall then ordain Aaron and his sons.
02 29:10 You shall bring the bull in front of the tent of meeting. Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull,
02 29:11 and you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
02 29:12 and shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and all the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.
02 29:13 You shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and turn them into smoke on the altar.
02 29:14 But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.
02 29:15 Then you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,
02 29:16 and you shall slaughter the ram, and shall take its blood and dash it against all sides of the altar.
02 29:17 Then you shall cut the ram into its parts, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its parts and its head,
02 29:18 and turn the whole ram into smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the LORD; it is a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
02 29:19 You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,
02 29:20 and you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear and on the lobes of the right ears of his sons, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet, and dash the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar.
02 29:21 Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his vestments and on his sons and his sons' vestments with him; then he and his vestments shall be holy, as well as his sons and his sons' vestments.
02 29:22 You shall also take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),
02 29:23 and one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD;
02 29:24 and you shall place all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and raise them as an elevation offering before the LORD.
02 29:25 Then you shall take them from their hands, and turn them into smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering of pleasing odor before the LORD; it is an offering by fire to the LORD.
02 29:26 You shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's ordination and raise it as an elevation offering before the LORD; and it shall be your portion.
02 29:27 You shall consecrate the breast that was raised as an elevation offering and the thigh that was raised as an elevation offering from the ram of ordination, from that which belonged to Aaron and his sons.
02 29:28 These things shall be a perpetual ordinance for Aaron and his sons from the Israelites, for this is an offering; and it shall be an offering by the Israelites from their sacrifice of offerings of well-being, their offering to the LORD.
02 29:29 The sacred vestments of Aaron shall be passed on to his sons after him; they shall be anointed in them and ordained in them.
02 29:30 The son who is priest in his place shall wear them seven days, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
02 29:31 You shall take the ram of ordination, and boil its flesh in a holy place;
02 29:32 and Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
02 29:33 They themselves shall eat the food by which atonement is made, to ordain and consecrate them, but no one else shall eat of them, because they are holy.
02 29:34 If any of the flesh for the ordination, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
02 29:35 Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, just as I have commanded you; through seven days you shall ordain them.
02 29:36 Also every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement. Also you shall offer a sin offering for the altar, when you make atonement for it, and shall anoint it, to consecrate it.
02 29:37 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and consecrate it, and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar shall become holy.
02 29:38 Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old regularly each day.
02 29:39 One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer in the evening;
02 29:40 and with the first lamb one-tenth of a measure of choice flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
02 29:41 And the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, and shall offer with it a grain offering and its drink offering, as in the morning, for a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
02 29:42 It shall be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.
02 29:43 I will meet with the Israelites there, and it shall be sanctified by my glory;
02 29:44 I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; Aaron also and his sons I will consecrate, to serve me as priests.
02 29:45 I will dwell among the Israelites, and I will be their God.
02 29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them; I am the LORD their God.
02 30:1 You shall make an altar on which to offer incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.
02 30:2 It shall be one cubit long, and one cubit wide; it shall be square, and shall be two cubits high; its horns shall be of one piece with it.
02 30:3 You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides all around and its horns; and you shall make for it a molding of gold all around.
02 30:4 And you shall make two golden rings for it; under its molding on two opposite sides of it you shall make them, and they shall hold the poles with which to carry it.
02 30:5 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
02 30:6 You shall place it in front of the curtain that is above the ark of the covenant, in front of the mercy seat that is over the covenant, where I will meet with you.
02 30:7 Aaron shall offer fragrant incense on it; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall offer it,
02 30:8 and when Aaron sets up the lamps in the evening, he shall offer it, a regular incense offering before the LORD throughout your generations.
02 30:9 You shall not offer unholy incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering; and you shall not pour a drink offering on it.
02 30:10 Once a year Aaron shall perform the rite of atonement on its horns. Throughout your generations he shall perform the atonement for it once a year with the blood of the atoning sin offering. It is most holy to the LORD.
02 30:11 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02 30:12 When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, at registration all of them shall give a ransom for their lives to the LORD, so that no plague may come upon them for being registered.
02 30:13 This is what each one who is registered shall give: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as an offering to the LORD.
02 30:14 Each one who is registered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the LORD's offering.
02 30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when you bring this offering to the LORD to make atonement for your lives.
02 30:16 You shall take the atonement money from the Israelites and shall designate it for the service of the tent of meeting; before the LORD it will be a reminder to the Israelites of the ransom given for your lives.
02 30:17 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02 30:18 You shall make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it;
02 30:19 with the water Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet.
02 30:20 When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to make an offering by fire to the LORD, they shall wash with water, so that they may not die.
02 30:21 They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die: it shall be a perpetual ordinance for them, for him and for his descendants throughout their generations.
02 30:22 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02 30:23 Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, two hundred fifty, and two hundred fifty of aromatic cane,
02 30:24 and five hundred of cassia--measured by the sanctuary shekel--and a hin of olive oil;
02 30:25 and you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
02 30:26 With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the covenant,
02 30:27 and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
02 30:28 and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand;
02 30:29 you shall consecrate them, so that they may be most holy; whatever touches them will become holy.
02 30:30 You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, in order that they may serve me as priests.
02 30:31 You shall say to the Israelites, "This shall be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations.
02 30:32 It shall not be used in any ordinary anointing of the body, and you shall make no other like it in composition; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
02 30:33 Whoever compounds any like it or whoever puts any of it on an unqualified person shall be cut off from the people."
02 30:34 The LORD said to Moses: Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense (an equal part of each),
02 30:35 and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy;
02 30:36 and you shall beat some of it into powder, and put part of it before the covenant in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with you; it shall be for you most holy.
02 30:37 When you make incense according to this composition, you shall not make it for yourselves; it shall be regarded by you as holy to the LORD.
02 30:38 Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume shall be cut off from the people.
02 31:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02 31:2 See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
02 31:3 and I have filled him with divine spirit, with ability, intelligence, and knowledge in every kind of craft,
02 31:4 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
02 31:5 in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, in every kind of craft.
02 31:6 Moreover, I have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have given skill to all the skillful, so that they may make all that I have commanded you:
02 31:7 the tent of meeting, and the ark of the covenant, and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
02 31:8 the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
02 31:9 and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand,
02 31:10 and the finely worked vestments, the holy vestments for the priest Aaron and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests,
02 31:11 and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the holy place. They shall do just as I have commanded you.
02 31:12 The LORD said to Moses:
02 31:13 You yourself are to speak to the Israelites: "You shall keep my sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, given in order that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.
02 31:14 You shall keep the sabbath, because it is holy for you; everyone who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on it shall be cut off from among the people.
02 31:15 Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall be put to death.
02 31:16 Therefore the Israelites shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant.
02 31:17 It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."
02 31:18 When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
02 32:1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make gods for us, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
02 32:2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."
02 32:3 So all the people took off the gold rings from their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
02 32:4 He took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"
02 32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the LORD."
02 32:6 They rose early the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.
02 32:7 The LORD said to Moses, "Go down at once! Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely;
02 32:8 they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!'"
02 32:9 The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they are.
02 32:10 Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make a great nation."
02 32:11 But Moses implored the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
02 32:12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people.
02 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying to them, 'I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
02 32:14 And the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people.
02 32:15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the covenant in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, written on the front and on the back.
02 32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.
02 32:17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."
02 32:18 But he said, "It is not the sound made by victors, or the sound made by losers; it is the sound of revelers that I hear."
02 32:19 As soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
02 32:20 He took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.
02 32:21 Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?"
02 32:22 And Aaron said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are bent on evil.
02 32:23 They said to me, 'Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
02 32:24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off'; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"
02 32:25 When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them run wild, to the derision of their enemies),
02 32:26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
02 32:27 He said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Put your sword on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.'"
02 32:28 The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the people fell on that day.
02 32:29 Moses said, "Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing on yourselves this day."
02 32:30 On the next day Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
02 32:31 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Alas, this people has sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.
02 32:32 But now, if you will only forgive their sin--but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written."
02 32:33 But the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
02 32:34 But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes for punishment, I will punish them for their sin."
02 32:35 Then the LORD sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf--the one that Aaron made.
02 33:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Go, leave this place, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.'
02 33:2 I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
02 33:3 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, or I would consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people."
02 33:4 When the people heard these harsh words, they mourned, and no one put on ornaments.
02 33:5 For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, and I will decide what to do to you.'"
02 33:6 Therefore the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
02 33:7 Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
02 33:8 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each of them, at the entrance of their tents and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
02 33:9 When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
02 33:10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and bow down, all of them, at the entrance of their tent.
02 33:11 Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then he would return to the camp; but his young assistant, Joshua son of Nun, would not leave the tent.
02 33:12 Moses said to the LORD, "See, you have said to me, 'Bring up this people'; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
02 33:13 Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people."
02 33:14 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
02 33:15 And he said to him, "If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here.
02 33:16 For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth."
02 33:17 The LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
02 33:18 Moses said, "Show me your glory, I pray."
02 33:19 And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, 'The LORD'; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
02 33:20 But," he said, "you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live."
02 33:21 And the LORD continued, "See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock;
02 33:22 and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;
02 33:23 then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen."
02 34:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you broke.
02 34:2 Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to me, on the top of the mountain.
02 34:3 No one shall come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; and do not let flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain."
02 34:4 So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the former ones; and he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
02 34:5 The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name, "The LORD."
02 34:6 The LORD passed before him, and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,
02 34:7 keeping steadfast love for the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, yet by no means clearing the guilty, but visiting the iniquity of the parents upon the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."
02 34:8 And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
02 34:9 He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."
02 34:10 He said: I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform marvels, such as have not been performed in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you live shall see the work of the LORD; for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
02 34:11 Observe what I command you today. See, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
02 34:12 Take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it will become a snare among you.
02 34:13 You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their sacred poles
02 34:14 (for you shall worship no other god, because the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).
02 34:15 You shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone among them will invite you, and you will eat of the sacrifice.
02 34:16 And you will take wives from among their daughters for your sons, and their daughters who prostitute themselves to their gods will make your sons also prostitute themselves to their gods.
02 34:17 You shall not make cast idols.
02 34:18 You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.
02 34:19 All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
02 34:20 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty-handed.
02 34:21 Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest.
02 34:22 You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.
02 34:23 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
02 34:24 For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
02 34:25 You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning.
02 34:26 The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
02 34:27 The LORD said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
02 34:28 He was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
02 34:29 Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.
02 34:30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.
02 34:31 But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them.
02 34:32 Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
02 34:33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face;
02 34:34 but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
02 34:35 the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
02 35:1 Moses assembled all the congregation of the Israelites and said to them: These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:
02 35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy sabbath of solemn rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
02 35:3 You shall kindle no fire in all your dwellings on the sabbath day.
02 35:4 Moses said to all the congregation of the Israelites: This is the thing that the LORD has commanded:
02 35:5 Take from among you an offering to the LORD; let whoever is of a generous heart bring the LORD's offering: gold, silver, and bronze;
02 35:6 blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine linen; goats' hair,
02 35:7 tanned rams' skins, and fine leather; acacia wood,
02 35:8 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
02 35:9 and onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece.
02 35:10 All who are skillful among you shall come and make all that the LORD has commanded: the tabernacle,
02 35:11 its tent and its covering, its clasps and its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
02 35:12 the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain for the screen;
02 35:13 the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02 35:14 the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light;
02 35:15 and the altar of incense, with its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance, the entrance of the tabernacle;
02 35:16 the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin with its stand;
02 35:17 the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court;
02 35:18 the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords;
02 35:19 the finely worked vestments for ministering in the holy place, the holy vestments for the priest Aaron, and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests.
02 35:20 Then all the congregation of the Israelites withdrew from the presence of Moses.
02 35:21 And they came, everyone whose heart was stirred, and everyone whose spirit was willing, and brought the LORD's offering to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the sacred vestments.
02 35:22 So they came, both men and women; all who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and pendants, all sorts of gold objects, everyone bringing an offering of gold to the LORD.
02 35:23 And everyone who possessed blue or purple or crimson yarn or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or fine leather, brought them.
02 35:24 Everyone who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD's offering; and everyone who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work, brought it.
02 35:25 All the skillful women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun in blue and purple and crimson yarns and fine linen;
02 35:26 all the women whose hearts moved them to use their skill spun the goats' hair.
02 35:27 And the leaders brought onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece,
02 35:28 and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
02 35:29 All the Israelite men and women whose hearts made them willing to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done, brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.
02 35:30 Then Moses said to the Israelites: See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
02 35:31 he has filled him with divine spirit, with skill, intelligence, and knowledge in every kind of craft,
02 35:32 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
02 35:33 in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, in every kind of craft.
02 35:34 And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
02 35:35 He has filled them with skill to do every kind of work done by an artisan or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and in fine linen, or by a weaver--by any sort of artisan or skilled designer.
02 36:1 Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the LORD has given skill and understanding to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.
02 36:2 Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the the LORD had given skill, everyone whose heart was stirred to come to do the work;
02 36:3 and they received from Moses all the freewill offerings that the Israelites had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,
02 36:4 so that all the artisans who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task being performed,
02 36:5 and said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do."
02 36:6 So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing;
02 36:7 for what they had already brought was more than enough to do all the work.
02 36:8 All those with skill among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains; they were made of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
02 36:9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains were of the same size.
02 36:10 He joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
02 36:11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set;
02 36:12 he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.
02 36:13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains one to the other with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole.
02 36:14 He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
02 36:15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were of the same size.
02 36:16 He joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
02 36:17 He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.
02 36:18 He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it might be one whole.
02 36:19 And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and an outer covering of fine leather.
02 36:20 Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.
02 36:21 Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the width of each frame.
02 36:22 Each frame had two pegs for fitting together; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
02 36:23 The frames for the tabernacle he made in this way: twenty frames for the south side;
02 36:24 and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under the first frame for its two pegs, and two bases under the next frame for its two pegs.
02 36:25 For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames
02 36:26 and their forty bases of silver, two bases under the first frame and two bases under the next frame.
02 36:27 For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.
02 36:28 He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.
02 36:29 They were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; he made two of them in this way, for the two corners.
02 36:30 There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.
02 36:31 He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,
02 36:32 and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
02 36:33 He made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the frames.
02 36:34 And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made rings of gold for them to hold the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
02 36:35 He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
02 36:36 For it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.
02 36:37 He also made a screen for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework;
02 36:38 and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their bases with gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
02 37:1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; it was two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02 37:2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold around it.
02 37:3 He cast for it four rings of gold for its four feet, two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.
02 37:4 He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold,
02 37:5 and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.
02 37:6 He made a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its width.
02 37:7 He made two cherubim of hammered gold; at the two ends of the mercy seat he made them,
02 37:8 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim at its two ends.
02 37:9 The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were turned toward the mercy seat.
02 37:10 He also made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02 37:11 He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it.
02 37:12 He made around it a rim a handbreadth wide, and made a molding of gold around the rim.
02 37:13 He cast for it four rings of gold, and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
02 37:14 The rings that held the poles used for carrying the table were close to the rim.
02 37:15 He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold.
02 37:16 And he made the vessels of pure gold that were to be on the table, its plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour drink offerings.
02 37:17 He also made the lampstand of pure gold. The base and the shaft of the lampstand were made of hammered work; its cups, its calyxes, and its petals were of one piece with it.
02 37:18 There were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it;
02 37:19 three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
02 37:20 On the lampstand itself there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its calyxes and petals.
02 37:21 There was a calyx of one piece with it under the first pair of branches, a calyx of one piece with it under the next pair of branches, and a calyx of one piece with it under the last pair of branches.
02 37:22 Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it, the whole of it one hammered piece of pure gold.
02 37:23 He made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
02 37:24 He made it and all its utensils of a talent of pure gold.
02 37:25 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood, one cubit long, and one cubit wide; it was square, and was two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with it.
02 37:26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made for it a molding of gold all around,
02 37:27 and made two golden rings for it under its molding, on two opposite sides of it, to hold the poles with which to carry it.
02 37:28 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
02 37:29 He made the holy anointing oil also, and the pure fragrant incense, blended as by the perfumer.
02 38:1 He made the altar of burnt offering also of acacia wood; it was five cubits long, and five cubits wide; it was square, and three cubits high.
02 38:2 He made horns for it on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
02 38:3 He made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans: all its utensils he made of bronze.
02 38:4 He made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, under its ledge, extending halfway down.
02 38:5 He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grating to hold the poles;
02 38:6 he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze.
02 38:7 And he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry it with them; he made it hollow, with boards.
02 38:8 He made the basin of bronze with its stand of bronze, from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
02 38:9 He made the court; for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long;
02 38:10 its twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
02 38:11 For the north side there were hangings one hundred cubits long; its twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
02 38:12 For the west side there were hangings fifty cubits long, with ten pillars and ten bases; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
02 38:13 And for the front to the east, fifty cubits.
02 38:14 The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases.
02 38:15 And so for the other side; on each side of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases.
02 38:16 All the hangings around the court were of fine twisted linen.
02 38:17 The bases for the pillars were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver; the overlaying of their capitals was also of silver, and all the pillars of the court were banded with silver.
02 38:18 The screen for the entrance to the court was embroidered with needlework in blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine twisted linen. It was twenty cubits long and, along the width of it, five cubits high, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
02 38:19 There were four pillars; their four bases were of bronze, their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their bands of silver.
02 38:20 All the pegs for the tabernacle and for the court all around were of bronze.
02 38:21 These are the records of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant, which were drawn up at the commandment of Moses, the work of the Levites being under the direction of Ithamar son of the priest Aaron.
02 38:22 Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses;
02 38:23 and with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, engraver, designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and in fine linen.
02 38:24 All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, measured by the sanctuary shekel.
02 38:25 The silver from those of the congregation who were counted was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, measured by the sanctuary shekel;
02 38:26 a beka a head (that is, half a shekel, measured by the sanctuary shekel), for everyone who was counted in the census, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred three thousand, five hundred fifty men.
02 38:27 The hundred talents of silver were for casting the bases of the sanctuary, and the bases of the curtain; one hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent for a base.
02 38:28 Of the thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals and made bands for them.
02 38:29 The bronze that was contributed was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels;
02 38:30 with it he made the bases for the entrance of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar,
02 38:31 the bases all around the court, and the bases of the gate of the court, all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs around the court.
02 39:1 Of the blue, purple, and crimson yarns they made finely worked vestments, for ministering in the holy place; they made the sacred vestments for Aaron; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:2 He made the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen.
02 39:3 Gold leaf was hammered out and cut into threads to work into the blue, purple, and crimson yarns and into the fine twisted linen, in skilled design.
02 39:4 They made for the ephod shoulder-pieces, joined to it at its two edges.
02 39:5 The decorated band on it was of the same materials and workmanship, of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:6 The onyx stones were prepared, enclosed in settings of gold filigree and engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.
02 39:7 He set them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:8 He made the breastpiece, in skilled work, like the work of the ephod, of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen.
02 39:9 It was square; the breastpiece was made double, a span in length and a span in width when doubled.
02 39:10 They set in it four rows of stones. A row of carnelian, chrysolite, and emerald was the first row;
02 39:11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a moonstone;
02 39:12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
02 39:13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were enclosed in settings of gold filigree.
02 39:14 There were twelve stones with names corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
02 39:15 They made on the breastpiece chains of pure gold, twisted like cords;
02 39:16 and they made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece;
02 39:17 and they put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece.
02 39:18 Two ends of the two cords they had attached to the two settings of filigree; in this way they attached it in front to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.
02 39:19 Then they made two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
02 39:20 They made two rings of gold, and attached them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its joining above the decorated band of the ephod.
02 39:21 They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it should lie on the decorated band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece should not come loose from the ephod; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:22 He also made the robe of the ephod woven all of blue yarn;
02 39:23 and the opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening in a coat of mail, with a binding around the opening, so that it might not be torn.
02 39:24 On the lower hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen.
02 39:25 They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the lower hem of the robe all around, between the pomegranates;
02 39:26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate all around on the lower hem of the robe for ministering; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:27 They also made the tunics, woven of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons,
02 39:28 and the turban of fine linen, and the head-dresses of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen,
02 39:29 and the sash of fine twisted linen, and of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, embroidered with needlework; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:30 They made the rosette of the holy diadem of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engraving of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."
02 39:31 They tied to it a blue cord, to fasten it on the turban above; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:32 In this way all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished; the Israelites had done everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
02 39:34 the covering of tanned rams' skins and the covering of fine leather, and the curtain for the screen;
02 39:35 the ark of the covenant with its poles and the mercy seat;
02 39:36 the table with all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02 39:37 the pure lampstand with its lamps set on it and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
02 39:38 the golden altar, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance of the tent;
02 39:39 the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
02 39:40 the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, and its pegs; and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
02 39:41 the finely worked vestments for ministering in the holy place, the sacred vestments for the priest Aaron, and the vestments of his sons to serve as priests.
02 39:42 The Israelites had done all of the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 39:43 When Moses saw that they had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded, he blessed them.
02 40:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02 40:2 On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
02 40:3 You shall put in it the ark of the covenant, and you shall screen the ark with the curtain.
02 40:4 You shall bring in the table, and arrange its setting; and you shall bring in the lampstand, and set up its lamps.
02 40:5 You shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the covenant, and set up the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle.
02 40:6 You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,
02 40:7 and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
02 40:8 You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court.
02 40:9 Then you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it shall become holy.
02 40:10 You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, so that the altar shall be most holy.
02 40:11 You shall also anoint the basin with its stand, and consecrate it.
02 40:12 Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water,
02 40:13 and put on Aaron the sacred vestments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, so that he may serve me as priest.
02 40:14 You shall bring his sons also and put tunics on them,
02 40:15 and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests: and their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout all generations to come.
02 40:16 Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.
02 40:17 In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.
02 40:18 Moses set up the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars;
02 40:19 and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:20 He took the covenant and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above the ark;
02 40:21 and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the curtain for screening, and screened the ark of the covenant; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:22 He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain,
02 40:23 and set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:24 He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle,
02 40:25 and set up the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:26 He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain,
02 40:27 and offered fragrant incense on it; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:28 He also put in place the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle.
02 40:29 He set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:30 He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing,
02 40:31 with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
02 40:32 When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02 40:33 He set up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the screen at the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
02 40:34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02 40:35 Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02 40:36 Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on each stage of their journey;
02 40:37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up.
02 40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel at each stage of their journey.
03
03 1:1 The LORD summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying:
03 1:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When any of you bring an offering of livestock to the LORD, you shall bring your offering from the herd or from the flock.
03 1:3 If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you shall offer a male without blemish; you shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, for acceptance in your behalf before the LORD.
03 1:4 You shall lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be acceptable in your behalf as atonement for you.
03 1:5 The bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD; and Aaron's sons the priests shall offer the blood, dashing the blood against all sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 1:6 The burnt offering shall be flayed and cut up into its parts.
03 1:7 The sons of the priest Aaron shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
03 1:8 Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the parts, with the head and the suet, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar;
03 1:9 but its entrails and its legs shall be washed with water. Then the priest shall turn the whole into smoke on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 1:10 If your gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, your offering shall be a male without blemish.
03 1:11 It shall be slaughtered on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash its blood against all sides of the altar.
03 1:12 It shall be cut up into its parts, with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar;
03 1:13 but the entrails and the legs shall be washed with water. Then the priest shall offer the whole and turn it into smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 1:14 If your offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, you shall choose your offering from turtledoves or pigeons.
03 1:15 The priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head, and turn it into smoke on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out against the side of the altar.
03 1:16 He shall remove its crop with its contents and throw it at the east side of the altar, in the place for ashes.
03 1:17 He shall tear it open by its wings without severing it. Then the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 2:1 When anyone presents a grain offering to the LORD, the offering shall be of choice flour; the worshiper shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it,
03 2:2 and bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. After taking from it a handful of the choice flour and oil, with all its frankincense, the priest shall turn this token portion into smoke on the altar, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 2:3 And what is left of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons, a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the LORD.
03 2:4 When you present a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall be of choice flour: unleavened cakes mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
03 2:5 If your offering is grain prepared on a griddle, it shall be of choice flour mixed with oil, unleavened;
03 2:6 break it in pieces, and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
03 2:7 If your offering is grain prepared in a pan, it shall be made of choice flour in oil.
03 2:8 You shall bring to the LORD the grain offering that is prepared in any of these ways; and when it is presented to the priest, he shall take it to the altar.
03 2:9 The priest shall remove from the grain offering its token portion and turn this into smoke on the altar, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 2:10 And what is left of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the LORD.
03 2:11 No grain offering that you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you must not turn any leaven or honey into smoke as an offering by fire to the LORD.
03 2:12 You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of choice products, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing odor.
03 2:13 You shall not omit from your grain offerings the salt of the covenant with your God; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.
03 2:14 If you bring a grain offering of first fruits to the LORD, you shall bring as the grain offering of your first fruits coarse new grain from fresh ears, parched with fire.
03 2:15 You shall add oil to it and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
03 2:16 And the priest shall turn a token portion of it into smoke--some of the coarse grain and oil with all its frankincense; it is an offering by fire to the LORD.
03 3:1 If the offering is a sacrifice of well-being, if you offer an animal of the herd, whether male or female, you shall offer one without blemish before the LORD.
03 3:2 You shall lay your hand on the head of the offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against all sides of the altar.
03 3:3 You shall offer from the sacrifice of well-being, as an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is around the entrails;
03 3:4 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
03 3:5 Then Aaron's sons shall turn these into smoke on the altar, with the burnt offering that is on the wood on the fire, as an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 3:6 If your offering for a sacrifice of well-being to the LORD is from the flock, male or female, you shall offer one without blemish.
03 3:7 If you present a sheep as your offering, you shall bring it before the LORD
03 3:8 and lay your hand on the head of the offering. It shall be slaughtered before the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons shall dash its blood against all sides of the altar.
03 3:9 You shall present its fat from the sacrifice of well-being, as an offering by fire to the LORD: the whole broad tail, which shall be removed close to the backbone, the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is around the entrails;
03 3:10 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which you shall remove with the kidneys.
03 3:11 Then the priest shall turn these into smoke on the altar as a food offering by fire to the LORD.
03 3:12 If your offering is a goat, you shall bring it before the LORD
03 3:13 and lay your hand on its head; it shall be slaughtered before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash its blood against all sides of the altar.
03 3:14 You shall present as your offering from it, as an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is around the entrails;
03 3:15 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which you shall remove with the kidneys.
03 3:16 Then the priest shall turn these into smoke on the altar as a food offering by fire for a pleasing odor. All fat is the LORD's.
03 3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, in all your settlements: you must not eat any fat or any blood.
03 4:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03 4:2 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: When anyone sins unintentionally in any of the LORD's commandments about things not to be done, and does any one of them:
03 4:3 If it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, he shall offer for the sin that he has committed a bull of the herd without blemish as a sin offering to the LORD.
03 4:4 He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD and lay his hand on the head of the bull; the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
03 4:5 The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting.
03 4:6 The priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.
03 4:7 The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is in the tent of meeting before the LORD; and the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 4:8 He shall remove all the fat from the bull of sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is around the entrails;
03 4:9 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins; and the appendage of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys,
03 4:10 just as these are removed from the ox of the sacrifice of well-being. The priest shall turn them into smoke upon the altar of burnt offering.
03 4:11 But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, as well as its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung--
03 4:12 all the rest of the bull--he shall carry out to a clean place outside the camp, to the ash heap, and shall burn it on a wood fire; at the ash heap it shall be burned.
03 4:13 If the whole congregation of Israel errs unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done and incur guilt;
03 4:14 when the sin that they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting.
03 4:15 The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
03 4:16 The anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting,
03 4:17 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain.
03 4:18 He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 4:19 He shall remove all its fat and turn it into smoke on the altar.
03 4:20 He shall do with the bull just as is done with the bull of sin offering; he shall do the same with this. The priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
03 4:21 He shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
03 4:22 When a ruler sins, doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by commandments of the LORD his God ought not to be done and incurs guilt,
03 4:23 once the sin that he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without blemish.
03 4:24 He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat; it shall be slaughtered at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
03 4:25 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
03 4:26 All its fat he shall turn into smoke on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of well-being. Thus the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
03 4:27 If anyone of the ordinary people among you sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done and incurs guilt,
03 4:28 when the sin that you have committed is made known to you, you shall bring a female goat without blemish as your offering, for the sin that you have committed.
03 4:29 You shall lay your hand on the head of the sin offering; and the sin offering shall be slaughtered at the place of the burnt offering.
03 4:30 The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he shall pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
03 4:31 He shall remove all its fat, as the fat is removed from the offering of well-being, and the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar for a pleasing odor to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf, and you shall be forgiven.
03 4:32 If the offering you bring as a sin offering is a sheep, you shall bring a female without blemish.
03 4:33 You shall lay your hand on the head of the sin offering; and it shall be slaughtered as a sin offering at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
03 4:34 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
03 4:35 You shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the sheep is removed from the sacrifice of well-being, and the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar, with the offerings by fire to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for the sin that you have committed, and you shall be forgiven.
03 5:1 When any of you sin in that you have heard a public adjuration to testify and--though able to testify as one who has seen or learned of the matter--does not speak up, you are subject to punishment.
03 5:2 Or when any of you touch any unclean thing--whether the carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean livestock or the carcass of an unclean swarming thing--and are unaware of it, you have become unclean, and are guilty.
03 5:3 Or when you touch human uncleanness--any uncleanness by which one can become unclean--and are unaware of it, when you come to know it, you shall be guilty.
03 5:4 Or when any of you utter aloud a rash oath for a bad or a good purpose, whatever people utter in an oath, and are unaware of it, when you come to know it, you shall in any of these be guilty.
03 5:5 When you realize your guilt in any of these, you shall confess the sin that you have committed.
03 5:6 And you shall bring to the LORD, as your penalty for the sin that you have committed, a female from the flock, a sheep or a goat, as a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for your sin.
03 5:7 But if you cannot afford a sheep, you shall bring to the LORD, as your penalty for the sin that you have committed, two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
03 5:8 You shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering, wringing its head at the nape without severing it.
03 5:9 He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
03 5:10 And the second he shall offer for a burnt offering according to the regulation. Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for the sin that you have committed, and you shall be forgiven.
03 5:11 But if you cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, you shall bring as your offering for the sin that you have committed one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour for a sin offering; you shall not put oil on it or lay frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
03 5:12 You shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall scoop up a handful of it as its memorial portion, and turn this into smoke on the altar, with the offerings by fire to the LORD; it is a sin offering.
03 5:13 Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for whichever of these sins you have committed, and you shall be forgiven. Like the grain offering, the rest shall be for the priest.
03 5:14 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 5:15 When any of you commit a trespass and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD, you shall bring, as your guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, convertible into silver by the sanctuary shekel; it is a guilt offering.
03 5:16 And you shall make restitution for the holy thing in which you were remiss, and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. The priest shall make atonement on your behalf with the ram of the guilt offering, and you shall be forgiven.
03 5:17 If any of you sin without knowing it, doing any of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, you have incurred guilt, and are subject to punishment.
03 5:18 You shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, or the equivalent, as a guilt offering; and the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for the error that you committed unintentionally, and you shall be forgiven.
03 5:19 It is a guilt offering; you have incurred guilt before the LORD.
03 6:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 6:2 When any of you sin and commit a trespass against the LORD by deceiving a neighbor in a matter of a deposit or a pledge, or by robbery, or if you have defrauded a neighbor,
03 6:3 or have found something lost and lied about it--if you swear falsely regarding any of the various things that one may do and sin thereby--
03 6:4 when you have sinned and realize your guilt, and would restore what you took by robbery or by fraud or the deposit that was committed to you, or the lost thing that you found,
03 6:5 or anything else about which you have sworn falsely, you shall repay the principal amount and shall add one-fifth to it. You shall pay it to its owner when you realize your guilt.
03 6:6 And you shall bring to the priest, as your guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering.
03 6:7 The priest shall make atonement on your behalf before the LORD, and you shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and incur guilt thereby.
03 6:8 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 6:9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the ritual of the burnt offering. The burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth upon the altar all night until the morning, while the fire on the altar shall be kept burning.
03 6:10 The priest shall put on his linen vestments after putting on his linen undergarments next to his body; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar, and place them beside the altar.
03 6:11 Then he shall take off his vestments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes out to a clean place outside the camp.
03 6:12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it shall not go out. Every morning the priest shall add wood to it, lay out the burnt offering on it, and turn into smoke the fat pieces of the offerings of well-being.
03 6:13 A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar; it shall not go out.
03 6:14 This is the ritual of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar.
03 6:15 They shall take from it a handful of the choice flour and oil of the grain offering, with all the frankincense that is on the offering, and they shall turn its memorial portion into smoke on the altar as a pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 6:16 Aaron and his sons shall eat what is left of it; it shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
03 6:17 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
03 6:18 Every male among the descendants of Aaron shall eat of it, as their perpetual due throughout your generations, from the LORD's offerings by fire; anything that touches them shall become holy.
03 6:19 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 6:20 This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour as a regular offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
03 6:21 It shall be made with oil on a griddle; you shall bring it well soaked, as a grain offering of baked pieces, and you shall present it as a pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 6:22 And so the priest, anointed from among Aaron's descendants as a successor, shall prepare it; it is the LORD's--a perpetual due--to be turned entirely into smoke.
03 6:23 Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not be eaten.
03 6:24 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 6:25 Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the ritual of the sin offering. The sin offering shall be slaughtered before the LORD at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
03 6:26 The priest who offers it as a sin offering shall eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting.
03 6:27 Whatever touches its flesh shall become holy; and when any of its blood is spattered on a garment, you shall wash the bespattered part in a holy place.
03 6:28 An earthen vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; but if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
03 6:29 Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it is most holy.
03 6:30 But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting for atonement in the holy place; it shall be burned with fire.
03 7:1 This is the ritual of the guilt offering. It is most holy;
03 7:2 at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered, they shall slaughter the guilt offering, and its blood shall be dashed against all sides of the altar.
03 7:3 All its fat shall be offered: the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
03 7:4 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which shall be removed with the kidneys.
03 7:5 The priest shall turn them into smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
03 7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
03 7:7 The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is the same ritual for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
03 7:8 So, too, the priest who offers anyone's burnt offering shall keep the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
03 7:9 And every grain offering baked in the oven, and all that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle, shall belong to the priest who offers it.
03 7:10 But every other grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron equally.
03 7:11 This is the ritual of the sacrifice of the offering of well-being that one may offer to the LORD.
03 7:12 If you offer it for thanksgiving, you shall offer with the thank offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of choice flour well soaked in oil.
03 7:13 With your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being you shall bring your offering with cakes of leavened bread.
03 7:14 From this you shall offer one cake from each offering, as a gift to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who dashes the blood of the offering of well-being.
03 7:15 And the flesh of your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being shall be eaten on the day it is offered; you shall not leave any of it until morning.
03 7:16 But if the sacrifice you offer is a votive offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that you offer your sacrifice, and what is left of it shall be eaten the next day;
03 7:17 but what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice shall be burned up on the third day.
03 7:18 If any of the flesh of your sacrifice of well-being is eaten on the third day, it shall not be acceptable, nor shall it be credited to the one who offers it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall incur guilt.
03 7:19 Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned up. As for other flesh, all who are clean may eat such flesh.
03 7:20 But those who eat flesh from the LORD's sacrifice of well-being while in a state of uncleanness shall be cut off from their kin.
03 7:21 When any one of you touches any unclean thing--human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature--and then eats flesh from the LORD's sacrifice of well-being, you shall be cut off from your kin.
03 7:22 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 7:23 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat.
03 7:24 The fat of an animal that died or was torn by wild animals may be put to any use, but you must not eat it.
03 7:25 If any one of you eats the fat from an animal of which an offering by fire may be made to the LORD, you who eat it shall be cut off from your kin.
03 7:26 You must not eat any blood whatever, either of bird or of animal, in any of your settlements.
03 7:27 Any one of you who eats any blood shall be cut off from your kin.
03 7:28 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 7:29 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: Any one of you who would offer to the LORD your sacrifice of well-being must yourself bring to the LORD your offering from your sacrifice of well-being.
03 7:30 Your own hands shall bring the LORD's offering by fire; you shall bring the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be raised as an elevation offering before the LORD.
03 7:31 The priest shall turn the fat into smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons.
03 7:32 And the right thigh from your sacrifices of well-being you shall give to the priest as an offering;
03 7:33 the one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the offering of well-being shall have the right thigh for a portion.
03 7:34 For I have taken the breast of the elevation offering, and the thigh that is offered, from the people of Israel, from their sacrifices of well-being, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
03 7:35 This is the portion allotted to Aaron and to his sons from the offerings made by fire to the LORD, once they have been brought forward to serve the LORD as priests;
03 7:36 these the LORD commanded to be given them, when he anointed them, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel throughout their generations.
03 7:37 This is the ritual of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the offering of ordination, and the sacrifice of well-being,
03 7:38 which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, when he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
03 8:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, the vestments, the anointing oil, the bull of sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
03 8:3 and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
03 8:5 Moses said to the congregation, "This is what the LORD has commanded to be done."
03 8:6 Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward, and washed them with water.
03 8:7 He put the tunic on him, fastened the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He then put the decorated band of the ephod around him, tying the ephod to him with it.
03 8:8 He placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
03 8:9 And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden ornament, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03 8:10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
03 8:11 He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to consecrate them.
03 8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
03 8:13 And Moses brought forward Aaron's sons, and clothed them with tunics, and fastened sashes around them, and tied headdresses on them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03 8:14 He led forward the bull of sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of sin offering,
03 8:15 and it was slaughtered. Moses took the blood and with his finger put some on each of the horns of the altar, purifying the altar; then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar. Thus he consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
03 8:16 Moses took all the fat that was around the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and turned them into smoke on the altar.
03 8:17 But the bull itself, its skin and flesh and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03 8:18 Then he brought forward the ram of burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
03 8:19 and it was slaughtered. Moses dashed the blood against all sides of the altar.
03 8:20 The ram was cut into its parts, and Moses turned into smoke the head and the parts and the suet.
03 8:21 And after the entrails and the legs were washed with water, Moses turned into smoke the whole ram on the altar; it was a burnt offering for a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03 8:22 Then he brought forward the second ram, the ram of ordination. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
03 8:23 and it was slaughtered. Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
03 8:24 After Aaron's sons were brought forward, Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet; and Moses dashed the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar.
03 8:25 He took the fat--the broad tail, all the fat that was around the entrails, the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat--and the right thigh.
03 8:26 From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread with oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.
03 8:27 He placed all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and raised them as an elevation offering before the LORD.
03 8:28 Then Moses took them from their hands and turned them into smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering for a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
03 8:29 Moses took the breast and raised it as an elevation offering before the LORD; it was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03 8:30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his vestments, and also on his sons and their vestments. Thus he consecrated Aaron and his vestments, and also his sons and their vestments.
03 8:31 And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it';
03 8:32 and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.
03 8:33 You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day when your period of ordination is completed. For it will take seven days to ordain you;
03 8:34 as has been done today, the LORD has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
03 8:35 You shall remain at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, keeping the LORD's charge so that you do not die; for so I am commanded."
03 8:36 Aaron and his sons did all the things that the LORD commanded through Moses.
03 9:1 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
03 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
03 9:3 And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;
03 9:4 and an ox and a ram for an offering of well-being to sacrifice before the LORD; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'"
03 9:5 They brought what Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting; and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
03 9:6 And Moses said, "This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
03 9:7 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and sacrifice the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD has commanded."
03 9:8 Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
03 9:9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
03 9:10 But the fat, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering he turned into smoke on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses;
03 9:11 and the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
03 9:12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he dashed it against all sides of the altar.
03 9:13 And they brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, and the head, which he turned into smoke on the altar.
03 9:14 He washed the entrails and the legs and, with the burnt offering, turned them into smoke on the altar.
03 9:15 Next he presented the people's offering. He took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people, and slaughtered it, and presented it as a sin offering like the first one.
03 9:16 He presented the burnt offering, and sacrificed it according to regulation.
03 9:17 He presented the grain offering, and, taking a handful of it, he turned it into smoke on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.
03 9:18 He slaughtered the ox and the ram as a sacrifice of well-being for the people. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, which he dashed against all sides of the altar,
03 9:19 and the fat of the ox and of the ram--the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the appendage of the liver.
03 9:20 They first laid the fat on the breasts, and the fat was turned into smoke on the altar;
03 9:21 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron raised as an elevation offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.
03 9:22 Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the offering of well-being.
03 9:23 Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting, and then came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
03 9:24 Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
03 10:1 Now Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer, put fire in it, and laid incense on it; and they offered unholy fire before the LORD, such as he had not commanded them.
03 10:2 And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
03 10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD meant when he said, 'Through those who are near me I will show myself holy, and before all the people I will be glorified.'" And Aaron was silent.
03 10:4 Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, "Come forward, and carry your kinsmen away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp."
03 10:5 They came forward and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had ordered.
03 10:6 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not dishevel your hair, and do not tear your vestments, or you will die and wrath will strike all the congregation; but your kindred, the whole house of Israel, may mourn the burning that the LORD has sent.
03 10:7 You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die; for the anointing oil of the LORD is on you." And they did as Moses had ordered.
03 10:8 And the LORD spoke to Aaron:
03 10:9 Drink no wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons, when you enter the tent of meeting, that you may not die; it is a statute forever throughout your generations.
03 10:10 You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
03 10:11 and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them through Moses.
03 10:12 Moses spoke to Aaron and to his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: Take the grain offering that is left from the LORD's offerings by fire, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy;
03 10:13 you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due, from the offerings by fire to the LORD; for so I am commanded.
03 10:14 But the breast that is elevated and the thigh that is raised, you and your sons and daughters as well may eat in any clean place; for they have been assigned to you and your children from the sacrifices of the offerings of well-being of the people of Israel.
03 10:15 The thigh that is raised and the breast that is elevated they shall bring, together with the offerings by fire of the fat, to raise for an elevation offering before the LORD; they are to be your due and that of your children forever, as the LORD has commanded.
03 10:16 Then Moses made inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and--it had already been burned! He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and said,
03 10:17 "Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sacred area? For it is most holy, and God has given it to you that you may remove the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement on their behalf before the LORD.
03 10:18 Its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
03 10:19 And Aaron spoke to Moses, "See, today they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and yet such things as these have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been agreeable to the LORD?"
03 10:20 And when Moses heard that, he agreed.
03 11:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them:
03 11:2 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: From among all the land animals, these are the creatures that you may eat.
03 11:3 Any animal that has divided hoofs and is cleft-footed and chews the cud--such you may eat.
03 11:4 But among those that chew the cud or have divided hoofs, you shall not eat the following: the camel, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have divided hoofs; it is unclean for you.
03 11:5 The rock badger, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have divided hoofs; it is unclean for you.
03 11:6 The hare, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have divided hoofs; it is unclean for you.
03 11:7 The pig, for even though it has divided hoofs and is cleft-footed, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.
03 11:8 Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean for you.
03 11:9 These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams--such you may eat.
03 11:10 But anything in the seas or the streams that does not have fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and among all the other living creatures that are in the waters--they are detestable to you
03 11:11 and detestable they shall remain. Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall regard as detestable.
03 11:12 Everything in the waters that does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.
03 11:13 These you shall regard as detestable among the birds. They shall not be eaten; they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
03 11:14 the buzzard, the kite of any kind;
03 11:15 every raven of any kind;
03 11:16 the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk of any kind;
03 11:17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
03 11:18 the water hen, the desert owl, the carrion vulture,
03 11:19 the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
03 11:20 All winged insects that walk upon all fours are detestable to you.
03 11:21 But among the winged insects that walk on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to leap on the ground.
03 11:22 Of them you may eat: the locust according to its kind, the bald locust according to its kind, the cricket according to its kind, and the grasshopper according to its kind.
03 11:23 But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.
03 11:24 By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean until the evening,
03 11:25 and whoever carries any part of the carcass of any of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
03 11:26 Every animal that has divided hoofs but is not cleft-footed or does not chew the cud is unclean for you; everyone who touches one of them shall be unclean.
03 11:27 All that walk on their paws, among the animals that walk on all fours, are unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean until the evening,
03 11:28 and the one who carries the carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean for you.
03 11:29 These are unclean for you among the creatures that swarm upon the earth: the weasel, the mouse, the great lizard according to its kind,
03 11:30 the gecko, the land crocodile, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.
03 11:31 These are unclean for you among all that swarm; whoever touches one of them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
03 11:32 And anything upon which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether an article of wood or cloth or skin or sacking, any article that is used for any purpose; it shall be dipped into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening, and then it shall be clean.
03 11:33 And if any of them falls into any earthen vessel, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you shall break the vessel.
03 11:34 Any food that could be eaten shall be unclean if water from any such vessel comes upon it; and any liquid that could be drunk shall be unclean if it was in any such vessel.
03 11:35 Everything on which any part of the carcass falls shall be unclean; whether an oven or stove, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall remain unclean for you.
03 11:36 But a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, while whatever touches the carcass in it shall be unclean.
03 11:37 If any part of their carcass falls upon any seed set aside for sowing, it is clean;
03 11:38 but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you.
03 11:39 If an animal of which you may eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
03 11:40 Those who eat of its carcass shall wash their clothes and be unclean until the evening; and those who carry the carcass shall wash their clothes and be unclean until the evening.
03 11:41 All creatures that swarm upon the earth are detestable; they shall not be eaten.
03 11:42 Whatever moves on its belly, and whatever moves on all fours, or whatever has many feet, all the creatures that swarm upon the earth, you shall not eat; for they are detestable.
03 11:43 You shall not make yourselves detestable with any creature that swarms; you shall not defile yourselves with them, and so become unclean.
03 11:44 For I am the LORD your God; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming creature that moves on the earth.
03 11:45 For I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt, to be your God; you shall be holy, for I am holy.
03 11:46 This is the law pertaining to land animal and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms upon the earth,
03 11:47 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.
03 12:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 12:2 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: If a woman conceives and bears a male child, she shall be ceremonially unclean seven days; as at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.
03 12:3 On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
03 12:4 Her time of blood purification shall be thirty-three days; she shall not touch any holy thing, or come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed.
03 12:5 If she bears a female child, she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation; her time of blood purification shall be sixty-six days.
03 12:6 When the days of her purification are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
03 12:7 He shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement on her behalf; then she shall be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, male or female.
03 12:8 If she cannot afford a sheep, she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement on her behalf, and she shall be clean.
03 13:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
03 13:2 When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a leprous disease on the skin of his body, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
03 13:3 The priest shall examine the disease on the skin of his body, and if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; after the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him ceremonially unclean.
03 13:4 But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall confine the diseased person for seven days.
03 13:5 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if he sees that the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall confine him seven days more.
03 13:6 The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the disease has abated and the disease has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
03 13:7 But if the eruption spreads in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.
03 13:8 The priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
03 13:9 When a person contracts a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest.
03 13:10 The priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,
03 13:11 it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not confine him, for he is unclean.
03 13:12 But if the disease breaks out in the skin, so that it covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,
03 13:13 then the priest shall make an examination, and if the disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; since it has all turned white, he is clean.
03 13:14 But if raw flesh ever appears on him, he shall be unclean;
03 13:15 the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.
03 13:16 But if the raw flesh again turns white, he shall come to the priest;
03 13:17 the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean. He is clean.
03 13:18 When there is on the skin of one's body a boil that has healed,
03 13:19 and in the place of the boil there appears a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, it shall be shown to the priest.
03 13:20 The priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; this is a leprous disease, broken out in the boil.
03 13:21 But if the priest examines it and the hair on it is not white, nor is it deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.
03 13:22 If it spreads in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.
03 13:23 But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; the priest shall pronounce him clean.
03 13:24 Or, when the body has a burn on the skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,
03 13:25 the priest shall examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.
03 13:26 But if the priest examines it and the hair in the spot is not white, and it is no deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.
03 13:27 The priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.
03 13:28 But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin but has abated, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.
03 13:29 When a man or woman has a disease on the head or in the beard,
03 13:30 the priest shall examine the disease. If it appears deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.
03 13:31 If the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall confine the person with the itching disease for seven days.
03 13:32 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,
03 13:33 he shall shave, but the itch he shall not shave. The priest shall confine the person with the itch for seven days more.
03 13:34 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.
03 13:35 But if the itch spreads in the skin after he was pronounced clean,
03 13:36 the priest shall examine him. If the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
03 13:37 But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
03 13:38 When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,
03 13:39 the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.
03 13:40 If anyone loses the hair from his head, he is bald but he is clean.
03 13:41 If he loses the hair from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.
03 13:42 But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
03 13:43 The priest shall examine him; if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, which resembles a leprous disease in the skin of the body,
03 13:44 he is leprous, he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; the disease is on his head.
03 13:45 The person who has the leprous disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head be disheveled; and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, "Unclean, unclean."
03 13:46 He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
03 13:47 Concerning clothing: when a leprous disease appears in it, in woolen or linen cloth,
03 13:48 in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,
03 13:49 if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.
03 13:50 The priest shall examine the disease, and put the diseased article aside for seven days.
03 13:51 He shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the cloth, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, this is a spreading leprous disease; it is unclean.
03 13:52 He shall burn the clothing, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a spreading leprous disease; it shall be burned in fire.
03 13:53 If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the clothing, in warp or woof or in anything of skin,
03 13:54 the priest shall command them to wash the article in which the disease appears, and he shall put it aside seven days more.
03 13:55 The priest shall examine the diseased article after it has been washed. If the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in fire, whether the leprous spot is on the inside or on the outside.
03 13:56 If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has abated after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the cloth, in warp or woof, or out of skin.
03 13:57 If it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which the disease appears.
03 13:58 But the cloth, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease disappears when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and it shall be clean.
03 13:59 This is the ritual for a leprous disease in a cloth of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.
03 14:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 14:2 This shall be the ritual for the leprous person at the time of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest;
03 14:3 the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make an examination. If the disease is healed in the leprous person,
03 14:4 the priest shall command that two living clean birds and cedarwood and crimson yarn and hyssop be brought for the one who is to be cleansed.
03 14:5 The priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in an earthen vessel.
03 14:6 He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the crimson yarn and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water.
03 14:7 He shall sprinkle it seven times upon the one who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease; then he shall pronounce him clean, and he shall let the living bird go into the open field.
03 14:8 The one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, but shall live outside his tent seven days.
03 14:9 On the seventh day he shall shave all his hair: of head, beard, eyebrows; he shall shave all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
03 14:10 On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb in its first year without blemish, and a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
03 14:11 The priest who cleanses shall set the person to be cleansed, along with these things, before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 14:12 The priest shall take one of the lambs, and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and raise them as an elevation offering before the LORD.
03 14:13 He shall slaughter the lamb in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered in the holy place; for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest: it is most holy.
03 14:14 The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot.
03 14:15 The priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand,
03 14:16 and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
03 14:17 Some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
03 14:18 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD:
03 14:19 the priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Afterward he shall slaughter the burnt offering;
03 14:20 and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement on his behalf and he shall be clean.
03 14:21 But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be elevated, to make atonement on his behalf, and one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil for a grain offering and a log of oil;
03 14:22 also two turtledoves or two pigeons, such as he can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
03 14:23 On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the LORD;
03 14:24 and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall raise them as an elevation offering before the LORD.
03 14:25 The priest shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering and shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot.
03 14:26 The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,
03 14:27 and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD.
03 14:28 The priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot, where the blood of the guilt offering was placed.
03 14:29 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before the LORD.
03 14:30 And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or pigeons such as he can afford,
03 14:31 one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with a grain offering; and the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one being cleansed.
03 14:32 This is the ritual for the one who has a leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing.
03 14:33 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
03 14:34 When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,
03 14:35 the owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, "There seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house."
03 14:36 The priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, or all that is in the house will become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.
03 14:37 He shall examine the disease; if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface,
03 14:38 the priest shall go outside to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.
03 14:39 The priest shall come again on the seventh day and make an inspection; if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
03 14:40 the priest shall command that the stones in which the disease appears be taken out and thrown into an unclean place outside the city.
03 14:41 He shall have the inside of the house scraped thoroughly, and the plaster that is scraped off shall be dumped in an unclean place outside the city.
03 14:42 They shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and take other plaster and plaster the house.
03 14:43 If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,
03 14:44 the priest shall go and make inspection; if the disease has spread in the house, it is a spreading leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.
03 14:45 He shall have the house torn down, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house, and taken outside the city to an unclean place.
03 14:46 All who enter the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening;
03 14:47 and all who sleep in the house shall wash their clothes; and all who eat in the house shall wash their clothes.
03 14:48 If the priest comes and makes an inspection, and the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, the priest shall pronounce the house clean; the disease is healed.
03 14:49 For the cleansing of the house he shall take two birds, with cedarwood and crimson yarn and hyssop,
03 14:50 and shall slaughter one of the birds over fresh water in an earthen vessel,
03 14:51 and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the crimson yarn, along with the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
03 14:52 Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the fresh water, and with the living bird, and with the cedarwood and hyssop and crimson yarn;
03 14:53 and he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field; so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
03 14:54 This is the ritual for any leprous disease: for an itch,
03 14:55 for leprous diseases in clothing and houses,
03 14:56 and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot,
03 14:57 to determine when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the ritual for leprous diseases.
03 15:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
03 15:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When any man has a discharge from his member, his discharge makes him ceremonially unclean.
03 15:3 The uncleanness of his discharge is this: whether his member flows with his discharge, or his member is stopped from discharging, it is uncleanness for him.
03 15:4 Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be unclean; and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
03 15:5 Anyone who touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:6 All who sit on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:7 All who touch the body of the one with the discharge shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:8 If the one with the discharge spits on persons who are clean, then they shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:9 Any saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean.
03 15:10 All who touch anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening, and all who carry such a thing shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:11 All those whom the one with the discharge touches without his having rinsed his hands in water shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:12 Any earthen vessel that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
03 15:13 When the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, he shall count seven days for his cleansing; he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in fresh water, and he shall be clean.
03 15:14 On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the LORD to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
03 15:15 The priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD for his discharge.
03 15:16 If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:17 Everything made of cloth or of skin on which the semen falls shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:18 If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:19 When a woman has a discharge of blood that is her regular discharge from her body, she shall be in her impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
03 15:20 Everything upon which she lies during her impurity shall be unclean; everything also upon which she sits shall be unclean.
03 15:21 Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:22 Whoever touches anything upon which she sits shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening;
03 15:23 whether it is the bed or anything upon which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening.
03 15:24 If any man lies with her, and her impurity falls on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
03 15:25 If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness; as in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean.
03 15:26 Every bed on which she lies during all the days of her discharge shall be treated as the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity.
03 15:27 Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.
03 15:28 If she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
03 15:29 On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03 15:30 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before the LORD for her unclean discharge.
03 15:31 Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.
03 15:32 This is the ritual for those who have a discharge: for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby,
03 15:33 for her who is in the infirmity of her period, for anyone, male or female, who has a discharge, and for the man who lies with a woman who is unclean.
03 16:1 The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died.
03 16:2 The LORD said to Moses: Tell your brother Aaron not to come just at any time into the sanctuary inside the curtain before the mercy seat that is upon the ark, or he will die; for I appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
03 16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
03 16:4 He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and shall have the linen undergarments next to his body, fasten the linen sash, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy vestments. He shall bathe his body in water, and then put them on.
03 16:5 He shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
03 16:6 Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.
03 16:7 He shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting;
03 16:8 and Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Azazel.
03 16:9 Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD, and offer it as a sin offering;
03 16:10 but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.
03 16:11 Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house; he shall slaughter the bull as a sin offering for himself.
03 16:12 He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of crushed sweet incense, and he shall bring it inside the curtain
03 16:13 and put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the covenant, or he will die.
03 16:14 He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times.
03 16:15 He shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.
03 16:16 Thus he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, and because of their transgressions, all their sins; and so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which remains with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
03 16:17 No one shall be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the sanctuary until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.
03 16:18 Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement on its behalf, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat, and put it on each of the horns of the altar.
03 16:19 He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.
03 16:20 When he has finished atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
03 16:21 Then Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and sending it away into the wilderness by means of someone designated for the task.
03 16:22 The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a barren region; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness.
03 16:23 Then Aaron shall enter the tent of meeting, and shall take off the linen vestments that he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there.
03 16:24 He shall bathe his body in water in a holy place, and put on his vestments; then he shall come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.
03 16:25 The fat of the sin offering he shall turn into smoke on the altar.
03 16:26 The one who sets the goat free for Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward may come into the camp.
03 16:27 The bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp; their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be consumed in fire.
03 16:28 The one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward may come into the camp.
03 16:29 This shall be a statute to you forever: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall deny yourselves, and shall do no work, neither the citizen nor the alien who resides among you.
03 16:30 For on this day atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before the LORD.
03 16:31 It is a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall deny yourselves; it is a statute forever.
03 16:32 The priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the linen vestments, the holy vestments.
03 16:33 He shall make atonement for the sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
03 16:34 This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the people of Israel once in the year for all their sins. And Moses did as the LORD had commanded him.
03 17:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03 17:2 Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the people of Israel and say to them: This is what the LORD has commanded.
03 17:3 If anyone of the house of Israel slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or slaughters it outside the camp,
03 17:4 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to present it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, he shall be held guilty of bloodshed; he has shed blood, and he shall be cut off from the people.
03 17:5 This is in order that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they offer in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and offer them as sacrifices of well-being to the LORD.
03 17:6 The priest shall dash the blood against the altar of the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and turn the fat into smoke as a pleasing odor to the LORD,
03 17:7 so that they may no longer offer their sacrifices for goat-demons, to whom they prostitute themselves. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.
03 17:8 And say to them further: Anyone of the house of Israel or of the aliens who reside among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
03 17:9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to the LORD, shall be cut off from the people.
03 17:10 If anyone of the house of Israel or of the aliens who reside among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood, and will cut that person off from the people.
03 17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you for making atonement for your lives on the altar; for, as life, it is the blood that makes atonement.
03 17:12 Therefore I have said to the people of Israel: No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any alien who resides among you eat blood.
03 17:13 And anyone of the people of Israel, or of the aliens who reside among them, who hunts down an animal or bird that may be eaten shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
03 17:14 For the life of every creature--its blood is its life; therefore I have said to the people of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.
03 17:15 All persons, citizens or aliens, who eat what dies of itself or what has been torn by wild animals, shall wash their clothes, and bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening; then they shall be clean.
03 17:16 But if they do not wash themselves or bathe their body, they shall bear their guilt.
03 18:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 18:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: I am the LORD your God.
03 18:3 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you. You shall not follow their statutes.
03 18:4 My ordinances you shall observe and my statutes you shall keep, following them: I am the LORD your God.
03 18:5 You shall keep my statutes and my ordinances; by doing so one shall live: I am the LORD.
03 18:6 None of you shall approach anyone near of kin to uncover nakedness: I am the LORD.
03 18:7 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
03 18:8 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is the nakedness of your father.
03 18:9 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether born at home or born abroad.
03 18:10 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter or of your daughter's daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness.
03 18:11 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, begotten by your father, since she is your sister.
03 18:12 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's flesh.
03 18:13 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's flesh.
03 18:14 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
03 18:15 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law: she is your son's wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
03 18:16 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness.
03 18:17 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, and you shall not take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are your flesh; it is depravity.
03 18:18 And you shall not take a woman as a rival to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive.
03 18:19 You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.
03 18:20 You shall not have sexual relations with your kinsman's wife, and defile yourself with her.
03 18:21 You shall not give any of your offspring to sacrifice them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.
03 18:22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.
03 18:23 You shall not have sexual relations with any animal and defile yourself with it, nor shall any woman give herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it: it is perversion.
03 18:24 Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for by all these practices the nations I am casting out before you have defiled themselves.
03 18:25 Thus the land became defiled; and I punished it for its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
03 18:26 But you shall keep my statutes and my ordinances and commit none of these abominations, either the citizen or the alien who resides among you
03 18:27 (for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled);
03 18:28 otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
03 18:29 For whoever commits any of these abominations shall be cut off from their people.
03 18:30 So keep my charge not to commit any of these abominations that were done before you, and not to defile yourselves by them: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 19:2 Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them: You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.
03 19:3 You shall each revere your mother and father, and you shall keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:4 Do not turn to idols or make cast images for yourselves: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:5 When you offer a sacrifice of well-being to the LORD, offer it in such a way that it is acceptable on your behalf.
03 19:6 It shall be eaten on the same day you offer it, or on the next day; and anything left over until the third day shall be consumed in fire.
03 19:7 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it will not be acceptable.
03 19:8 All who eat it shall be subject to punishment, because they have profaned what is holy to the LORD; and any such person shall be cut off from the people.
03 19:9 When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
03 19:10 You shall not strip your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the alien: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:11 You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; and you shall not lie to one another.
03 19:12 And you shall not swear falsely by my name, profaning the name of your God: I am the LORD.
03 19:13 You shall not defraud your neighbor; you shall not steal; and you shall not keep for yourself the wages of a laborer until morning.
03 19:14 You shall not revile the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind; you shall fear your God: I am the LORD.
03 19:15 You shall not render an unjust judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great: with justice you shall judge your neighbor.
03 19:16 You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not profit by the blood of your neighbor: I am the LORD.
03 19:17 You shall not hate in your heart anyone of your kin; you shall reprove your neighbor, or you will incur guilt yourself.
03 19:18 You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.
03 19:19 You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your animals breed with a different kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed; nor shall you put on a garment made of two different materials.
03 19:20 If a man has sexual relations with a woman who is a slave, designated for another man but not ransomed or given her freedom, an inquiry shall be held. They shall not be put to death, since she has not been freed;
03 19:21 but he shall bring a guilt offering for himself to the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, a ram as guilt offering.
03 19:22 And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of guilt offering before the LORD for his sin that he committed; and the sin he committed shall be forgiven him.
03 19:23 When you come into the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall regard their fruit as forbidden; three years it shall be forbidden to you, it must not be eaten.
03 19:24 In the fourth year all their fruit shall be set apart for rejoicing in the LORD.
03 19:25 But in the fifth year you may eat of their fruit, that their yield may be increased for you: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:26 You shall not eat anything with its blood. You shall not practice augury or witchcraft.
03 19:27 You shall not round off the hair on your temples or mar the edges of your beard.
03 19:28 You shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tattoo any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
03 19:29 Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, that the land not become prostituted and full of depravity.
03 19:30 You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
03 19:31 Do not turn to mediums or wizards; do not seek them out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:32 You shall rise before the aged, and defer to the old; and you shall fear your God: I am the LORD.
03 19:33 When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien.
03 19:34 The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
03 19:35 You shall not cheat in measuring length, weight, or quantity.
03 19:36 You shall have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
03 19:37 You shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and observe them: I am the LORD.
03 20:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 20:2 Say further to the people of Israel: Any of the people of Israel, or of the aliens who reside in Israel, who give any of their offspring to Molech shall be put to death; the people of the land shall stone them to death.
03 20:3 I myself will set my face against them, and will cut them off from the people, because they have given of their offspring to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name.
03 20:4 And if the people of the land should ever close their eyes to them, when they give of their offspring to Molech, and do not put them to death,
03 20:5 I myself will set my face against them and against their family, and will cut them off from among their people, them and all who follow them in prostituting themselves to Molech.
03 20:6 If any turn to mediums and wizards, prostituting themselves to them, I will set my face against them, and will cut them off from the people.
03 20:7 Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the LORD your God.
03 20:8 Keep my statutes, and observe them; I am the LORD; I sanctify you.
03 20:9 All who curse father or mother shall be put to death; having cursed father or mother, their blood is upon them.
03 20:10 If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.
03 20:11 The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall be put to death; their blood is upon them.
03 20:12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed perversion, their blood is upon them.
03 20:13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood is upon them.
03 20:14 If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is depravity; they shall be burned to death, both he and they, that there may be no depravity among you.
03 20:15 If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the animal.
03 20:16 If a woman approaches any animal and has sexual relations with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.
03 20:17 If a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace, and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people; he has uncovered his sister's nakedness, he shall be subject to punishment.
03 20:18 If a man lies with a woman having her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow and she has laid bare her flow of blood; both of them shall be cut off from their people.
03 20:19 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for that is to lay bare one's own flesh; they shall be subject to punishment.
03 20:20 If a man lies with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they shall be subject to punishment; they shall die childless.
03 20:21 If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
03 20:22 You shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and observe them, so that the land to which I bring you to settle in may not vomit you out.
03 20:23 You shall not follow the practices of the nation that I am driving out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.
03 20:24 But I have said to you: You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the LORD your God; I have separated you from the peoples.
03 20:25 You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; you shall not bring abomination on yourselves by animal or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.
03 20:26 You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD am holy, and I have separated you from the other peoples to be mine.
03 20:27 A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned to death, their blood is upon them.
03 21:1 The LORD said to Moses: Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his relatives,
03 21:2 except for his nearest kin: his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother;
03 21:3 likewise, for a virgin sister, close to him because she has had no husband, he may defile himself for her.
03 21:4 But he shall not defile himself as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
03 21:5 They shall not make bald spots upon their heads, or shave off the edges of their beards, or make any gashes in their flesh.
03 21:6 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the LORD's offerings by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
03 21:7 They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled; neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband. For they are holy to their God,
03 21:8 and you shall treat them as holy, since they offer the food of your God; they shall be holy to you, for I the LORD, I who sanctify you, am holy.
03 21:9 When the daughter of a priest profanes herself through prostitution, she profanes her father; she shall be burned to death.
03 21:10 The priest who is exalted above his fellows, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the vestments, shall not dishevel his hair, nor tear his vestments.
03 21:11 He shall not go where there is a dead body; he shall not defile himself even for his father or mother.
03 21:12 He shall not go outside the sanctuary and thus profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
03 21:13 He shall marry only a woman who is a virgin.
03 21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, a prostitute, these he shall not marry. He shall marry a virgin of his own kin,
03 21:15 that he may not profane his offspring among his kin; for I am the LORD; I sanctify him.
03 21:16 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 21:17 Speak to Aaron and say: No one of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the food of his God.
03 21:18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, one who is blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long,
03 21:19 or one who has a broken foot or a broken hand,
03 21:20 or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a blemish in his eyes or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles.
03 21:21 No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD's offerings by fire; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God.
03 21:22 He may eat the food of his God, of the most holy as well as of the holy.
03 21:23 But he shall not come near the curtain or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries; for I am the LORD; I sanctify them.
03 21:24 Thus Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
03 22:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 22:2 Direct Aaron and his sons to deal carefully with the sacred donations of the people of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they may not profane my holy name; I am the LORD.
03 22:3 Say to them: If anyone among all your offspring throughout your generations comes near the sacred donations, which the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he is in a state of uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
03 22:4 No one of Aaron's offspring who has a leprous disease or suffers a discharge may eat of the sacred donations until he is clean. Whoever touches anything made unclean by a corpse or a man who has had an emission of semen,
03 22:5 and whoever touches any swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or any human being by whom he may be made unclean--whatever his uncleanness may be--
03 22:6 the person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the sacred donations unless he has washed his body in water.
03 22:7 When the sun sets he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the sacred donations, for they are his food.
03 22:8 That which died or was torn by wild animals he shall not eat, becoming unclean by it: I am the LORD.
03 22:9 They shall keep my charge, so that they may not incur guilt and die in the sanctuary for having profaned it: I am the LORD; I sanctify them.
03 22:10 No lay person shall eat of the sacred donations. No bound or hired servant of the priest shall eat of the sacred donations;
03 22:11 but if a priest acquires anyone by purchase, the person may eat of them; and those that are born in his house may eat of his food.
03 22:12 If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the sacred donations;
03 22:13 but if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced, without offspring, and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food. No lay person shall eat of it.
03 22:14 If a man eats of the sacred donation unintentionally, he shall add one-fifth of its value to it, and give the sacred donation to the priest.
03 22:15 No one shall profane the sacred donations of the people of Israel, which they offer to the LORD,
03 22:16 causing them to bear guilt requiring a guilt offering, by eating their sacred donations: for I am the LORD; I sanctify them.
03 22:17 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 22:18 Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them: When anyone of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing in Israel presents an offering, whether in payment of a vow or as a freewill offering that is offered to the LORD as a burnt offering,
03 22:19 to be acceptable in your behalf it shall be a male without blemish, of the cattle or the sheep or the goats.
03 22:20 You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable in your behalf.
03 22:21 When anyone offers a sacrifice of well-being to the LORD, in fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, to be acceptable it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
03 22:22 Anything blind, or injured, or maimed, or having a discharge or an itch or scabs--these you shall not offer to the LORD or put any of them on the altar as offerings by fire to the LORD.
03 22:23 An ox or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short you may present for a freewill offering; but it will not be accepted for a vow.
03 22:24 Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the LORD; such you shall not do within your land,
03 22:25 nor shall you accept any such animals from a foreigner to offer as food to your God; since they are mutilated, with a blemish in them, they shall not be accepted in your behalf.
03 22:26 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 22:27 When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as the LORD's offering by fire.
03 22:28 But you shall not slaughter, from the herd or the flock, an animal with its young on the same day.
03 22:29 When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that it may be acceptable in your behalf.
03 22:30 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall not leave any of it until morning: I am the LORD.
03 22:31 Thus you shall keep my commandments and observe them: I am the LORD.
03 22:32 You shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel: I am the LORD; I sanctify you,
03 22:33 I who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD.
03 23:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 23:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: These are the appointed festivals of the LORD that you shall proclaim as holy convocations, my appointed festivals.
03 23:3 Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no work: it is a sabbath to the LORD throughout your settlements.
03 23:4 These are the appointed festivals of the LORD, the holy convocations, which you shall celebrate at the time appointed for them.
03 23:5 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, there shall be a passover offering to the LORD,
03 23:6 and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the festival of unleavened bread to the LORD; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
03 23:7 On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.
03 23:8 For seven days you shall present the LORD's offerings by fire; on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation: you shall not work at your occupations.
03 23:9 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03 23:10 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.
03 23:11 He shall raise the sheaf before the LORD, that you may find acceptance; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall raise it.
03 23:12 On the day when you raise the sheaf, you shall offer a lamb a year old, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the LORD.
03 23:13 And the grain offering with it shall be two-tenths of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, one-fourth of a hin.
03 23:14 You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that very day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your settlements.
03 23:15 And from the day after the sabbath, from the day on which you bring the sheaf of the elevation offering, you shall count off seven weeks; they shall be complete.
03 23:16 You shall count until the day after the seventh sabbath, fifty days; then you shall present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
03 23:17 You shall bring from your settlements two loaves of bread as an elevation offering, each made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of choice flour, baked with leaven, as first fruits to the LORD.
03 23:18 You shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, along with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD.
03 23:19 You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of well-being.
03 23:20 The priest shall raise them with the bread of the first fruits as an elevation offering before the LORD, together with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
03 23:21 On that same day you shall make proclamation; you shall hold a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations. This is a statute forever in all your settlements throughout your generations.
03 23:22 When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the alien: I am the LORD your God.
03 23:23 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 23:24 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of complete rest, a holy convocation commemorated with trumpet blasts.
03 23:25 You shall not work at your occupations; and you shall present the LORD's offering by fire.
03 23:26 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 23:27 Now, the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you: you shall deny yourselves and present the LORD's offering by fire;
03 23:28 and you shall do no work during that entire day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God.
03 23:29 For anyone who does not practice self-denial during that entire day shall be cut off from the people.
03 23:30 And anyone who does any work during that entire day, such a one I will destroy from the midst of the people.
03 23:31 You shall do no work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your settlements.
03 23:32 It shall be to you a sabbath of complete rest, and you shall deny yourselves; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your sabbath.
03 23:33 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 23:34 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and lasting seven days, there shall be the festival of booths to the LORD.
03 23:35 The first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.
03 23:36 Seven days you shall present the LORD's offerings by fire; on the eighth day you shall observe a holy convocation and present the LORD's offerings by fire; it is a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your occupations.
03 23:37 These are the appointed festivals of the LORD, which you shall celebrate as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the LORD offerings by fire--burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day--
03 23:38 apart from the sabbaths of the LORD, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your votive offerings, and apart from all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
03 23:39 Now, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the festival of the LORD, lasting seven days; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day.
03 23:40 On the first day you shall take the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
03 23:41 You shall keep it as a festival to the LORD seven days in the year; you shall keep it in the seventh month as a statute forever throughout your generations.
03 23:42 You shall live in booths for seven days; all that are citizens in Israel shall live in booths,
03 23:43 so that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
03 23:44 Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed festivals of the LORD.
03 24:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 24:2 Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly.
03 24:3 Aaron shall set it up in the tent of meeting, outside the curtain of the covenant, to burn from evening to morning before the LORD regularly; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
03 24:4 He shall set up the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the LORD regularly.
03 24:5 You shall take choice flour, and bake twelve loaves of it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf.
03 24:6 You shall place them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure gold.
03 24:7 You shall put pure frankincense with each row, to be a token offering for the bread, as an offering by fire to the LORD.
03 24:8 Every sabbath day Aaron shall set them in order before the LORD regularly as a commitment of the people of Israel, as a covenant forever.
03 24:9 They shall be for Aaron and his descendants, who shall eat them in a holy place, for they are most holy portions for him from the offerings by fire to the LORD, a perpetual due.
03 24:10 A man whose mother was an Israelite and whose father was an Egyptian came out among the people of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a certain Israelite began fighting in the camp.
03 24:11 The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name in a curse. And they brought him to Moses--now his mother's name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan--
03 24:12 and they put him in custody, until the decision of the LORD should be made clear to them.
03 24:13 The LORD said to Moses, saying:
03 24:14 Take the blasphemer outside the camp; and let all who were within hearing lay their hands on his head, and let the whole congregation stone him.
03 24:15 And speak to the people of Israel, saying: Anyone who curses God shall bear the sin.
03 24:16 One who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall be put to death; the whole congregation shall stone the blasphemer. Aliens as well as citizens, when they blaspheme the Name, shall be put to death.
03 24:17 Anyone who kills a human being shall be put to death.
03 24:18 Anyone who kills an animal shall make restitution for it, life for life.
03 24:19 Anyone who maims another shall suffer the same injury in return:
03 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; the injury inflicted is the injury to be suffered.
03 24:21 One who kills an animal shall make restitution for it; but one who kills a human being shall be put to death.
03 24:22 You shall have one law for the alien and for the citizen: for I am the LORD your God.
03 24:23 Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel; and they took the blasphemer outside the camp, and stoned him to death. The people of Israel did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03 25:1 The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:
03 25:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land shall observe a sabbath for the LORD.
03 25:3 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in their yield;
03 25:4 but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of complete rest for the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
03 25:5 You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your unpruned vine: it shall be a year of complete rest for the land.
03 25:6 You may eat what the land yields during its sabbath--you, your male and female slaves, your hired and your bound laborers who live with you;
03 25:7 for your livestock also, and for the wild animals in your land all its yield shall be for food.
03 25:8 You shall count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the period of seven weeks of years gives forty-nine years.
03 25:9 Then you shall have the trumpet sounded loud; on the tenth day of the seventh month--on the day of atonement--you shall have the trumpet sounded throughout all your land.
03 25:10 And you shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you: you shall return, every one of you, to your property and every one of you to your family.
03 25:11 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall not sow, or reap the aftergrowth, or harvest the unpruned vines.
03 25:12 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat only what the field itself produces.
03 25:13 In this year of jubilee you shall return, every one of you, to your property.
03 25:14 When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not cheat one another.
03 25:15 When you buy from your neighbor, you shall pay only for the number of years since the jubilee; the seller shall charge you only for the remaining crop years.
03 25:16 If the years are more, you shall increase the price, and if the years are fewer, you shall diminish the price; for it is a certain number of harvests that are being sold to you.
03 25:17 You shall not cheat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the LORD your God.
03 25:18 You shall observe my statutes and faithfully keep my ordinances, so that you may live on the land securely.
03 25:19 The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live on it securely.
03 25:20 Should you ask, What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?
03 25:21 I will order my blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will yield a crop for three years.
03 25:22 When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating from the old crop; until the ninth year, when its produce comes in, you shall eat the old.
03 25:23 The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants.
03 25:24 Throughout the land that you hold, you shall provide for the redemption of the land.
03 25:25 If anyone of your kin falls into difficulty and sells a piece of property, then the next of kin shall come and redeem what the relative has sold.
03 25:26 If the person has no one to redeem it, but then prospers and finds sufficient means to do so,
03 25:27 the years since its sale shall be computed and the difference shall be refunded to the person to whom it was sold, and the property shall be returned.
03 25:28 But if there is not sufficient means to recover it, what was sold shall remain with the purchaser until the year of jubilee; in the jubilee it shall be released, and the property shall be returned.
03 25:29 If anyone sells a dwelling house in a walled city, it may be redeemed until a year has elapsed since its sale; the right of redemption shall be one year.
03 25:30 If it is not redeemed before a full year has elapsed, a house that is in a walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the purchaser, throughout the generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee.
03 25:31 But houses in villages that have no walls around them shall be classed as open country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee.
03 25:32 As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites shall forever have the right of redemption of the houses in the cities belonging to them.
03 25:33 Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites--houses sold in a city belonging to them--shall be released in the jubilee; because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel.
03 25:34 But the open land around their cities may not be sold; for that is their possession for all time.
03 25:35 If any of your kin fall into difficulty and become dependent on you, you shall support them; they shall live with you as though resident aliens.
03 25:36 Do not take interest in advance or otherwise make a profit from them, but fear your God; let them live with you.
03 25:37 You shall not lend them your money at interest taken in advance, or provide them food at a profit.
03 25:38 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.
03 25:39 If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves.
03 25:40 They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.
03 25:41 Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority; they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property.
03 25:42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.
03 25:43 You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God.
03 25:44 As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.
03 25:45 You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property.
03 25:46 You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness.
03 25:47 If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch of the alien's family,
03 25:48 after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption; one of their brothers may redeem them,
03 25:49 or their uncle or their uncle's son may redeem them, or anyone of their family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may redeem themselves.
03 25:50 They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be rated as the time of a hired laborer.
03 25:51 If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion to the purchase price;
03 25:52 and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus: according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption.
03 25:53 As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien's authority, who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight.
03 25:54 And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children with them shall go free in the jubilee year.
03 25:55 For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
03 26:1 You shall make for yourselves no idols and erect no carved images or pillars, and you shall not place figured stones in your land, to worship at them; for I am the LORD your God.
03 26:2 You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
03 26:3 If you follow my statutes and keep my commandments and observe them faithfully,
03 26:4 I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
03 26:5 Your threshing shall overtake the vintage, and the vintage shall overtake the sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and live securely in your land.
03 26:6 And I will grant peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one shall make you afraid; I will remove dangerous animals from the land, and no sword shall go through your land.
03 26:7 You shall give chase to your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
03 26:8 Five of you shall give chase to a hundred, and a hundred of you shall give chase to ten thousand; your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
03 26:9 I will look with favor upon you and make you fruitful and multiply you; and I will maintain my covenant with you.
03 26:10 You shall eat old grain long stored, and you shall have to clear out the old to make way for the new.
03 26:11 I will place my dwelling in your midst, and I shall not abhor you.
03 26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.
03 26:13 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be their slaves no more; I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect.
03 26:14 But if you will not obey me, and do not observe all these commandments,
03 26:15 if you spurn my statutes, and abhor my ordinances, so that you will not observe all my commandments, and you break my covenant,
03 26:16 I in turn will do this to you: I will bring terror on you; consumption and fever that waste the eyes and cause life to pine away. You shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
03 26:17 I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down by your enemies; your foes shall rule over you, and you shall flee though no one pursues you.
03 26:18 And if in spite of this you will not obey me, I will continue to punish you sevenfold for your sins.
03 26:19 I will break your proud glory, and I will make your sky like iron and your earth like copper.
03 26:20 Your strength shall be spent to no purpose: your land shall not yield its produce, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.
03 26:21 If you continue hostile to me, and will not obey me, I will continue to plague you sevenfold for your sins.
03 26:22 I will let loose wild animals against you, and they shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock; they shall make you few in number, and your roads shall be deserted.
03 26:23 If in spite of these punishments you have not turned back to me, but continue hostile to me,
03 26:24 then I too will continue hostile to you: I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins.
03 26:25 I will bring the sword against you, executing vengeance for the covenant; and if you withdraw within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into enemy hands.
03 26:26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven, and they shall dole out your bread by weight; and though you eat, you shall not be satisfied.
03 26:27 But if, despite this, you disobey me, and continue hostile to me,
03 26:28 I will continue hostile to you in fury; I in turn will punish you myself sevenfold for your sins.
03 26:29 You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.
03 26:30 I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars; I will heap your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols. I will abhor you.
03 26:31 I will lay your cities waste, will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing odors.
03 26:32 I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to settle in it shall be appalled at it.
03 26:33 And you I will scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword against you; your land shall be a desolation, and your cities a waste.
03 26:34 Then the land shall enjoy its sabbath years as long as it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its sabbath years.
03 26:35 As long as it lies desolate, it shall have the rest it did not have on your sabbaths when you were living on it.
03 26:36 And as for those of you who survive, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall though no one pursues.
03 26:37 They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though no one pursues; and you shall have no power to stand against your enemies.
03 26:38 You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.
03 26:39 And those of you who survive shall languish in the land of your enemies because of their iniquities; also they shall languish because of the iniquities of their ancestors.
03 26:40 But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors, in that they committed treachery against me and, moreover, that they continued hostile to me--
03 26:41 so that I, in turn, continued hostile to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity,
03 26:42 then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; I will remember also my covenant with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
03 26:43 For the land shall be deserted by them, and enjoy its sabbath years by lying desolate without them, while they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they dared to spurn my ordinances, and they abhorred my statutes.
03 26:44 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, or abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God;
03 26:45 but I will remember in their favor the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, to be their God: I am the LORD.
03 26:46 These are the statutes and ordinances and laws that the LORD established between himself and the people of Israel on Mount Sinai through Moses.
03 27:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
03 27:2 Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When a person makes an explicit vow to the LORD concerning the equivalent for a human being,
03 27:3 the equivalent for a male shall be: from twenty to sixty years of age the equivalent shall be fifty shekels of silver by the sanctuary shekel.
03 27:4 If the person is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels.
03 27:5 If the age is from five to twenty years of age, the equivalent is twenty shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female.
03 27:6 If the age is from one month to five years, the equivalent for a male is five shekels of silver, and for a female the equivalent is three shekels of silver.
03 27:7 And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the equivalent for a male is fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
03 27:8 If any cannot afford the equivalent, they shall be brought before the priest and the priest shall assess them; the priest shall assess them according to what each one making a vow can afford.
03 27:9 If it concerns an animal that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any such that may be given to the LORD shall be holy.
03 27:10 Another shall not be exchanged or substituted for it, either good for bad or bad for good; and if one animal is substituted for another, both that one and its substitute shall be holy.
03 27:11 If it concerns any unclean animal that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal shall be presented before the priest.
03 27:12 The priest shall assess it: whether good or bad, according to the assessment of the priest, so it shall be.
03 27:13 But if it is to be redeemed, one-fifth must be added to the assessment.
03 27:14 If a person consecrates a house to the LORD, the priest shall assess it: whether good or bad, as the priest assesses it, so it shall stand.
03 27:15 And if the one who consecrates the house wishes to redeem it, one-fifth shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original owner.
03 27:16 If a person consecrates to the LORD any inherited landholding, its assessment shall be in accordance with its seed requirements: fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed.
03 27:17 If the person consecrates the field as of the year of jubilee, that assessment shall stand;
03 27:18 but if the field is consecrated after the jubilee, the priest shall compute the price for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and the assessment shall be reduced.
03 27:19 And if the one who consecrates the field wishes to redeem it, then one-fifth shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original owner;
03 27:20 but if the field is not redeemed, or if it has been sold to someone else, it shall no longer be redeemable.
03 27:21 But when the field is released in the jubilee, it shall be holy to the LORD as a devoted field; it becomes the priest's holding.
03 27:22 If someone consecrates to the LORD a field that has been purchased, which is not a part of the inherited landholding,
03 27:23 the priest shall compute for it the proportionate assessment up to the year of jubilee, and the assessment shall be paid as of that day, a sacred donation to the LORD.
03 27:24 In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought, whose holding the land is.
03 27:25 All assessments shall be by the sanctuary shekel: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.
03 27:26 A firstling of animals, however, which as a firstling belongs to the LORD, cannot be consecrated by anyone; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.
03 27:27 If it is an unclean animal, it shall be ransomed at its assessment, with one-fifth added; if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at its assessment.
03 27:28 Nothing that a person owns that has been devoted to destruction for the LORD, be it human or animal, or inherited landholding, may be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
03 27:29 No human beings who have been devoted to destruction can be ransomed; they shall be put to death.
03 27:30 All tithes from the land, whether the seed from the ground or the fruit from the tree, are the LORD's; they are holy to the LORD.
03 27:31 If persons wish to redeem any of their tithes, they must add one-fifth to them.
03 27:32 All tithes of herd and flock, every tenth one that passes under the shepherd's staff, shall be holy to the LORD.
03 27:33 Let no one inquire whether it is good or bad, or make substitution for it; if one makes substitution for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy and cannot be redeemed.
03 27:34 These are the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.

04 1:1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
04 1:2 Take a census of the whole congregation of Israelites, in their clans, by ancestral houses, according to the number of names, every male individually;
04 1:3 from twenty years old and upward, everyone in Israel able to go to war. You and Aaron shall enroll them, company by company.
04 1:4 A man from each tribe shall be with you, each man the head of his ancestral house.
04 1:5 These are the names of the men who shall assist you: From Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur.
04 1:6 From Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
04 1:7 From Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04 1:8 From Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar.
04 1:9 From Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon.
04 1:10 From the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
04 1:11 From Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni.
04 1:12 From Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04 1:13 From Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran.
04 1:14 From Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04 1:15 From Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.
04 1:16 These were the ones chosen from the congregation, the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the divisions of Israel.
04 1:17 Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
04 1:18 and on the first day of the second month they assembled the whole congregation together. They registered themselves in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, individually,
04 1:19 as the LORD commanded Moses. So he enrolled them in the wilderness of Sinai.
04 1:20 The descendants of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, individually, every male from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:21 those enrolled of the tribe of Reuben were forty-six thousand five hundred.
04 1:22 The descendants of Simeon, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, those of them that were numbered, according to the number of names, individually, every male from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:23 those enrolled of the tribe of Simeon were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
04 1:24 The descendants of Gad, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:25 those enrolled of the tribe of Gad were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
04 1:26 The descendants of Judah, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:27 those enrolled of the tribe of Judah were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
04 1:28 The descendants of Issachar, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:29 those enrolled of the tribe of Issachar were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
04 1:30 The descendants of Zebulun, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:31 those enrolled of the tribe of Zebulun were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
04 1:32 The descendants of Joseph, namely, the descendants of Ephraim, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:33 those enrolled of the tribe of Ephraim were forty thousand five hundred.
04 1:34 The descendants of Manasseh, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:35 those enrolled of the tribe of Manasseh were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
04 1:36 The descendants of Benjamin, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:37 those enrolled of the tribe of Benjamin were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
04 1:38 The descendants of Dan, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:39 those enrolled of the tribe of Dan were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
04 1:40 The descendants of Asher, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:41 those enrolled of the tribe of Asher were forty-one thousand five hundred.
04 1:42 The descendants of Naphtali, their lineage, in their clans, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war:
04 1:43 those enrolled of the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
04 1:44 These are those who were enrolled, whom Moses and Aaron enrolled with the help of the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each representing his ancestral house.
04 1:45 So the whole number of the Israelites, by their ancestral houses, from twenty years old and upward, everyone able to go to war in Israel--
04 1:46 their whole number was six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
04 1:47 The Levites, however, were not numbered by their ancestral tribe along with them.
04 1:48 The LORD had said to Moses:
04 1:49 Only the tribe of Levi you shall not enroll, and you shall not take a census of them with the other Israelites.
04 1:50 Rather you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the covenant, and over all its equipment, and over all that belongs to it; they are to carry the tabernacle and all its equipment, and they shall tend it, and shall camp around the tabernacle.
04 1:51 When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.
04 1:52 The other Israelites shall camp in their respective regimental camps, by companies;
04 1:53 but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the covenant, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the Israelites; and the Levites shall perform the guard duty of the tabernacle of the covenant.
04 1:54 The Israelites did so; they did just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04 2:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
04 2:2 The Israelites shall camp each in their respective regiments, under ensigns by their ancestral houses; they shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side.
04 2:3 Those to camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the regimental encampment of Judah by companies. The leader of the people of Judah shall be Nahshon son of Amminadab,
04 2:4 with a company as enrolled of seventy-four thousand six hundred.
04 2:5 Those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar. The leader of the Issacharites shall be Nethanel son of Zuar,
04 2:6 with a company as enrolled of fifty-four thousand four hundred.
04 2:7 Then the tribe of Zebulun: The leader of the Zebulunites shall be Eliab son of Helon,
04 2:8 with a company as enrolled of fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
04 2:9 The total enrollment of the camp of Judah, by companies, is one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred. They shall set out first on the march.
04 2:10 On the south side shall be the regimental encampment of Reuben by companies. The leader of the Reubenites shall be Elizur son of Shedeur,
04 2:11 with a company as enrolled of forty-six thousand five hundred.
04 2:12 And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon. The leader of the Simeonites shall be Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
04 2:13 with a company as enrolled of fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
04 2:14 Then the tribe of Gad: The leader of the Gadites shall be Eliasaph son of Reuel,
04 2:15 with a company as enrolled of forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
04 2:16 The total enrollment of the camp of Reuben, by companies, is one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty. They shall set out second.
04 2:17 The tent of meeting, with the camp of the Levites, shall set out in the center of the camps; they shall set out just as they camp, each in position, by their regiments.
04 2:18 On the west side shall be the regimental encampment of Ephraim by companies. The leader of the people of Ephraim shall be Elishama son of Ammihud,
04 2:19 with a company as enrolled of forty thousand five hundred.
04 2:20 Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh. The leader of the people of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
04 2:21 with a company as enrolled of thirty-two thousand two hundred.
04 2:22 Then the tribe of Benjamin: The leader of the Benjaminites shall be Abidan son of Gideoni,
04 2:23 with a company as enrolled of thirty-five thousand four hundred.
04 2:24 The total enrollment of the camp of Ephraim, by companies, is one hundred eight thousand one hundred. They shall set out third on the march.
04 2:25 On the north side shall be the regimental encampment of Dan by companies. The leader of the Danites shall be Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai,
04 2:26 with a company as enrolled of sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
04 2:27 Those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher. The leader of the Asherites shall be Pagiel son of Ochran,
04 2:28 with a company as enrolled of forty-one thousand five hundred.
04 2:29 Then the tribe of Naphtali: The leader of the Naphtalites shall be Ahira son of Enan,
04 2:30 with a company as enrolled of fifty-three thousand four hundred.
04 2:31 The total enrollment of the camp of Dan is one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last, by companies.
04 2:32 This was the enrollment of the Israelites by their ancestral houses; the total enrollment in the camps by their companies was six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
04 2:33 Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, the Levites were not enrolled among the other Israelites.
04 2:34 The Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses: They camped by regiments, and they set out the same way, everyone by clans, according to ancestral houses.
04 3:1 This is the lineage of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
04 3:2 These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar;
04 3:3 these are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to minister as priests.
04 3:4 Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered illicit fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.
04 3:5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 3:6 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, so that they may assist him.
04 3:7 They shall perform duties for him and for the whole congregation in front of the tent of meeting, doing service at the tabernacle;
04 3:8 they shall be in charge of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and attend to the duties for the Israelites as they do service at the tabernacle.
04 3:9 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and his descendants; they are unreservedly given to him from among the Israelites.
04 3:10 But you shall make a register of Aaron and his descendants; it is they who shall attend to the priesthood, and any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.
04 3:11 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 3:12 I hereby accept the Levites from among the Israelites as substitutes for all the firstborn that open the womb among the Israelites. The Levites shall be mine,
04 3:13 for all the firstborn are mine; when I killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both human and animal; they shall be mine. I am the LORD.
04 3:14 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying:
04 3:15 Enroll the Levites by ancestral houses and by clans. You shall enroll every male from a month old and upward.
04 3:16 So Moses enrolled them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.
04 3:17 The following were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
04 3:18 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
04 3:19 The sons of Kohath by their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
04 3:20 The sons of Merari by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, by their ancestral houses.
04 3:21 To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.
04 3:22 Their enrollment, counting all the males from a month old and upward, was seven thousand five hundred.
04 3:23 The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west,
04 3:24 with Eliasaph son of Lael as head of the ancestral house of the Gershonites.
04 3:25 The responsibility of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was to be the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
04 3:26 the hangings of the court, the screen for the entrance of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords--all the service pertaining to these.
04 3:27 To Kohath belonged the clan of the Amramites, the clan of the Izharites, the clan of the Hebronites, and the clan of the Uzzielites; these are the clans of the Kohathites.
04 3:28 Counting all the males, from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred, attending to the duties of the sanctuary.
04 3:29 The clans of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
04 3:30 with Elizaphan son of Uzziel as head of the ancestral house of the clans of the Kohathites.
04 3:31 Their responsibility was to be the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and the screen--all the service pertaining to these.
04 3:32 Eleazar son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the leaders of the Levites, and to have oversight of those who had charge of the sanctuary.
04 3:33 To Merari belonged the clan of the Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites: these are the clans of Merari.
04 3:34 Their enrollment, counting all the males from a month old and upward, was six thousand two hundred.
04 3:35 The head of the ancestral house of the clans of Merari was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
04 3:36 The responsibility assigned to the sons of Merari was to be the frames of the tabernacle, the bars, the pillars, the bases, and all their accessories--all the service pertaining to these;
04 3:37 also the pillars of the court all around, with their bases and pegs and cords.
04 3:38 Those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle on the east--in front of the tent of meeting toward the east--were Moses and Aaron and Aaron's sons, having charge of the rites within the sanctuary, whatever had to be done for the Israelites; and any outsider who came near was to be put to death.
04 3:39 The total enrollment of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron enrolled at the commandment of the LORD, by their clans, all the males from a month old and upward, was twenty-two thousand.
04 3:40 Then the LORD said to Moses: Enroll all the firstborn males of the Israelites, from a month old and upward, and count their names.
04 3:41 But you shall accept the Levites for me--I am the LORD--as substitutes for all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for all the firstborn among the livestock of the Israelites.
04 3:42 So Moses enrolled all the firstborn among the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him.
04 3:43 The total enrollment, all the firstborn males from a month old and upward, counting the number of names, was twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
04 3:44 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 3:45 Accept the Levites as substitutes for all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine. I am the LORD.
04 3:46 As the price of redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the Israelites, over and above the number of the Levites,
04 3:47 you shall accept five shekels apiece, reckoning by the shekel of the sanctuary, a shekel of twenty gerahs.
04 3:48 Give to Aaron and his sons the money by which the excess number of them is redeemed.
04 3:49 So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites;
04 3:50 from the firstborn of the Israelites he took the money, one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, reckoned by the shekel of the sanctuary;
04 3:51 and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 4:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
04 4:2 Take a census of the Kohathites separate from the other Levites, by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04 4:3 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who qualify to do work relating to the tent of meeting.
04 4:4 The service of the Kohathites relating to the tent of meeting concerns the most holy things.
04 4:5 When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the screening curtain, and cover the ark of the covenant with it;
04 4:6 then they shall put on it a covering of fine leather, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and shall put its poles in place.
04 4:7 Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the plates, the dishes for incense, the bowls, and the flagons for the drink offering; the regular bread also shall be on it;
04 4:8 then they shall spread over them a crimson cloth, and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and shall put its poles in place.
04 4:9 They shall take a blue cloth, and cover the lampstand for the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all the vessels for oil with which it is supplied;
04 4:10 and they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of fine leather, and put it on the carrying frame.
04 4:11 Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and shall put its poles in place;
04 4:12 and they shall take all the utensils of the service that are used in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on the carrying frame.
04 4:13 They shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it;
04 4:14 and they shall put on it all the utensils of the altar, which are used for the service there, the firepans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of fine leather, and shall put its poles in place.
04 4:15 When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the Kohathites shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, or they will die. These are the things of the tent of meeting that the Kohathites are to carry.
04 4:16 Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering, and the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, in the sanctuary and in its utensils.
04 4:17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
04 4:18 You must not let the tribe of the clans of the Kohathites be destroyed from among the Levites.
04 4:19 This is how you must deal with them in order that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each to a particular task or burden.
04 4:20 But the Kohathites must not go in to look on the holy things even for a moment; otherwise they will die.
04 4:21 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 4:22 Take a census of the Gershonites also, by their ancestral houses and by their clans;
04 4:23 from thirty years old up to fifty years old you shall enroll them, all who qualify to do work in the tent of meeting.
04 4:24 This is the service of the clans of the Gershonites, in serving and bearing burdens:
04 4:25 They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting with its covering, and the outer covering of fine leather that is on top of it, and the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
04 4:26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords, and all the equipment for their service; and they shall do all that needs to be done with regard to them.
04 4:27 All the service of the Gershonites shall be at the command of Aaron and his sons, in all that they are to carry, and in all that they have to do; and you shall assign to their charge all that they are to carry.
04 4:28 This is the service of the clans of the Gershonites relating to the tent of meeting, and their responsibilities are to be under the oversight of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04 4:29 As for the Merarites, you shall enroll them by their clans and their ancestral houses;
04 4:30 from thirty years old up to fifty years old you shall enroll them, everyone who qualifies to do the work of the tent of meeting.
04 4:31 This is what they are charged to carry, as the whole of their service in the tent of meeting: the frames of the tabernacle, with its bars, pillars, and bases,
04 4:32 and the pillars of the court all around with their bases, pegs, and cords, with all their equipment and all their related service; and you shall assign by name the objects that they are required to carry.
04 4:33 This is the service of the clans of the Merarites, the whole of their service relating to the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04 4:34 So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation enrolled the Kohathites, by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04 4:35 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who qualified for work relating to the tent of meeting;
04 4:36 and their enrollment by clans was two thousand seven hundred fifty.
04 4:37 This was the enrollment of the clans of the Kohathites, all who served at the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron enrolled according to the commandment of the LORD by Moses.
04 4:38 The enrollment of the Gershonites, by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04 4:39 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who qualified for work relating to the tent of meeting--
04 4:40 their enrollment by their clans and their ancestral houses was two thousand six hundred thirty.
04 4:41 This was the enrollment of the clans of the Gershonites, all who served at the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron enrolled according to the commandment of the LORD.
04 4:42 The enrollment of the clans of the Merarites, by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04 4:43 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who qualified for work relating to the tent of meeting--
04 4:44 their enrollment by their clans was three thousand two hundred.
04 4:45 This is the enrollment of the clans of the Merarites, whom Moses and Aaron enrolled according to the commandment of the LORD by Moses.
04 4:46 All those who were enrolled of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel enrolled, by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04 4:47 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who qualified to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens relating to the tent of meeting,
04 4:48 their enrollment was eight thousand five hundred eighty.
04 4:49 According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses they were appointed to their several tasks of serving or carrying; thus they were enrolled by him, as the LORD commanded Moses.
04 5:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 5:2 Command the Israelites to put out of the camp everyone who is leprous, or has a discharge, and everyone who is unclean through contact with a corpse;
04 5:3 you shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp; they must not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.
04 5:4 The Israelites did so, putting them outside the camp; as the LORD had spoken to Moses, so the Israelites did.
04 5:5 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 5:6 Speak to the Israelites: When a man or a woman wrongs another, breaking faith with the LORD, that person incurs guilt
04 5:7 and shall confess the sin that has been committed. The person shall make full restitution for the wrong, adding one fifth to it, and giving it to the one who was wronged.
04 5:8 If the injured party has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the LORD for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for the guilty party.
04 5:9 Among all the sacred donations of the Israelites, every gift that they bring to the priest shall be his.
04 5:10 The sacred donations of all are their own; whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his.
04 5:11 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 5:12 Speak to the Israelites and say to them: If any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
04 5:13 if a man has had intercourse with her but it is hidden from her husband, so that she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her since she was not caught in the act;
04 5:14 if a spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself; or if a spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself;
04 5:15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. And he shall bring the offering required for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
04 5:16 Then the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD;
04 5:17 the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
04 5:18 The priest shall set the woman before the LORD, dishevel the woman's hair, and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. In his own hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
04 5:19 Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, "If no man has lain with you, if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband's authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse.
04 5:20 But if you have gone astray while under your husband's authority, if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has had intercourse with you,"
04 5:21 --let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse and say to the woman--"the LORD make you an execration and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your uterus drop, your womb discharge;
04 5:22 now may this water that brings the curse enter your bowels and make your womb discharge, your uterus drop!" And the woman shall say, "Amen. Amen."
04 5:23 Then the priest shall put these curses in writing, and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
04 5:24 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter her and cause bitter pain.
04 5:25 The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall elevate the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;
04 5:26 and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and turn it into smoke on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
04 5:27 When he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall discharge, her uterus drop, and the woman shall become an execration among her people.
04 5:28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be immune and be able to conceive children.
04 5:29 This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband's authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
04 5:30 or when a spirit of jealousy comes on a man and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall apply this entire law to her.
04 5:31 The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.
04 6:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 6:2 Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When either men or women make a special vow, the vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves to the LORD,
04 6:3 they shall separate themselves from wine and strong drink; they shall drink no wine vinegar or other vinegar, and shall not drink any grape juice or eat grapes, fresh or dried.
04 6:4 All their days as nazirites they shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.
04 6:5 All the days of their nazirite vow no razor shall come upon the head; until the time is completed for which they separate themselves to the LORD, they shall be holy; they shall let the locks of the head grow long.
04 6:6 All the days that they separate themselves to the LORD they shall not go near a corpse.
04 6:7 Even if their father or mother, brother or sister, should die, they may not defile themselves; because their consecration to God is upon the head.
04 6:8 All their days as nazirites they are holy to the LORD.
04 6:9 If someone dies very suddenly nearby, defiling the consecrated head, then they shall shave the head on the day of their cleansing; on the seventh day they shall shave it.
04 6:10 On the eighth day they shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
04 6:11 and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for them, because they incurred guilt by reason of the corpse. They shall sanctify the head that same day,
04 6:12 and separate themselves to the LORD for their days as nazirites, and bring a male lamb a year old as a guilt offering. The former time shall be void, because the consecrated head was defiled.
04 6:13 This is the law for the nazirites when the time of their consecration has been completed: they shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
04 6:14 and they shall offer their gift to the LORD, one male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering, one ram without blemish as an offering of well-being,
04 6:15 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of choice flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, with their grain offering and their drink offerings.
04 6:16 The priest shall present them before the LORD and offer their sin offering and burnt offering,
04 6:17 and shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of well-being to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest also shall make the accompanying grain offering and drink offering.
04 6:18 Then the nazirites shall shave the consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair from the consecrated head and put it on the fire under the sacrifice of well-being.
04 6:19 The priest shall take the shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them in the palms of the nazirites, after they have shaved the consecrated head.
04 6:20 Then the priest shall elevate them as an elevation offering before the LORD; they are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is elevated and the thigh that is offered. After that the nazirites may drink wine.
04 6:21 This is the law for the nazirites who take a vow. Their offering to the LORD must be in accordance with the nazirite vow, apart from what else they can afford. In accordance with whatever vow they take, so they shall do, following the law for their consecration.
04 6:22 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 6:23 Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the Israelites: You shall say to them,
04 6:24 The LORD bless you and keep you;
04 6:25 the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you;
04 6:26 the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.
04 6:27 So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.
04 7:1 On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings, and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,
04 7:2 the leaders of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses, the leaders of the tribes, who were over those who were enrolled, made offerings.
04 7:3 They brought their offerings before the LORD, six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; they presented them before the tabernacle.
04 7:4 Then the LORD said to Moses:
04 7:5 Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each according to his service.
04 7:6 So Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
04 7:7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the Gershonites, according to their service;
04 7:8 and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the Merarites, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04 7:9 But to the Kohathites he gave none, because they were charged with the care of the holy things that had to be carried on the shoulders.
04 7:10 The leaders also presented offerings for the dedication of the altar at the time when it was anointed; the leaders presented their offering before the altar.
04 7:11 The LORD said to Moses: They shall present their offerings, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.

04 7:89 When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he would hear the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the covenant from between the two cherubim; thus it spoke to him.
04 8:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 8:2 Speak to Aaron and say to him: When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.
04 8:3 Aaron did so; he set up its lamps to give light in front of the lampstand, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 8:4 Now this was how the lampstand was made, out of hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
04 8:5 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 8:6 Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them.
04 8:7 Thus you shall do to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification on them, have them shave their whole body with a razor and wash their clothes, and so cleanse themselves.
04 8:8 Then let them take a young bull and its grain offering of choice flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull for a sin offering.
04 8:9 You shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and assemble the whole congregation of the Israelites.
04 8:10 When you bring the Levites before the LORD, the Israelites shall lay their hands on the Levites,
04 8:11 and Aaron shall present the Levites before the LORD as an elevation offering from the Israelites, that they may do the service of the LORD.
04 8:12 The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and he shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
04 8:13 Then you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and you shall present them as an elevation offering to the LORD.
04 8:14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the other Israelites, and the Levites shall be mine.
04 8:15 Thereafter the Levites may go in to do service at the tent of meeting, once you have cleansed them and presented them as an elevation offering.
04 8:16 For they are unreservedly given to me from among the Israelites; I have taken them for myself, in place of all that open the womb, the firstborn of all the Israelites.
04 8:17 For all the firstborn among the Israelites are mine, both human and animal. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,
04 8:18 but I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites.
04 8:19 Moreover, I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to do the service for the Israelites at the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the Israelites, in order that there may be no plague among the Israelites for coming too close to the sanctuary.
04 8:20 Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation of the Israelites did with the Levites accordingly; the Israelites did with the Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning them.
04 8:21 The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them as an elevation offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
04 8:22 Thereafter the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting in attendance on Aaron and his sons. As the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did with them.
04 8:23 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 8:24 This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall begin to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting;
04 8:25 and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from the duty of the service and serve no more.
04 8:26 They may assist their brothers in the tent of meeting in carrying out their duties, but they shall perform no service. Thus you shall do with the Levites in assigning their duties.
04 9:1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
04 9:2 Let the Israelites keep the passover at its appointed time.
04 9:3 On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its regulations you shall keep it.
04 9:4 So Moses told the Israelites that they should keep the passover.
04 9:5 They kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai. Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did.
04 9:6 Now there were certain people who were unclean through touching a corpse, so that they could not keep the passover on that day. They came before Moses and Aaron on that day,
04 9:7 and said to him, "Although we are unclean through touching a corpse, why must we be kept from presenting the LORD's offering at its appointed time among the Israelites?"
04 9:8 Moses spoke to them, "Wait, so that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you."
04 9:9 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 9:10 Speak to the Israelites, saying: Anyone of you or your descendants who is unclean through touching a corpse, or is away on a journey, shall still keep the passover to the LORD.
04 9:11 In the second month on the fourteenth day, at twilight, they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
04 9:12 They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it.
04 9:13 But anyone who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet refrains from keeping the passover, shall be cut off from the people for not presenting the LORD's offering at its appointed time; such a one shall bear the consequences for the sin.
04 9:14 Any alien residing among you who wishes to keep the passover to the LORD shall do so according to the statute of the passover and according to its regulation; you shall have one statute for both the resident alien and the native.
04 9:15 On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant; and from evening until morning it was over the tabernacle, having the appearance of fire.
04 9:16 It was always so: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
04 9:17 Whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, then the Israelites would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the Israelites would camp.
04 9:18 At the command of the LORD the Israelites would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they would remain in camp.
04 9:19 Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the Israelites would keep the charge of the LORD, and would not set out.
04 9:20 Sometimes the cloud would remain a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they would remain in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they would set out.
04 9:21 Sometimes the cloud would remain from evening until morning; and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they would set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they would set out.
04 9:22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, resting upon it, the Israelites would remain in camp and would not set out; but when it lifted they would set out.
04 9:23 At the command of the LORD they would camp, and at the command of the LORD they would set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.
04 10:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 10:2 Make two silver trumpets; you shall make them of hammered work; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation, and for breaking camp.
04 10:3 When both are blown, the whole congregation shall assemble before you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
04 10:4 But if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall assemble before you.
04 10:5 When you blow an alarm, the camps on the east side shall set out;
04 10:6 when you blow a second alarm, the camps on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
04 10:7 But when the assembly is to be gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
04 10:8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; this shall be a perpetual institution for you throughout your generations.
04 10:9 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before the LORD your God and be saved from your enemies.
04 10:10 Also on your days of rejoicing, at your appointed festivals, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over your sacrifices of well-being; they shall serve as a reminder on your behalf before the LORD your God: I am the LORD your God.
04 10:11 In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the covenant.
04 10:12 Then the Israelites set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
04 10:13 They set out for the first time at the command of the LORD by Moses.
04 10:14 The standard of the camp of Judah set out first, company by company, and over the whole company was Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04 10:15 Over the company of the tribe of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar;
04 10:16 and over the company of the tribe of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon.
04 10:17 Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites, who carried the tabernacle, set out.
04 10:18 Next the standard of the camp of Reuben set out, company by company; and over the whole company was Elizur son of Shedeur.
04 10:19 Over the company of the tribe of Simeon was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
04 10:20 and over the company of the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04 10:21 Then the Kohathites, who carried the holy things, set out; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.
04 10:22 Next the standard of the Ephraimite camp set out, company by company, and over the whole company was Elishama son of Ammihud.
04 10:23 Over the company of the tribe of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
04 10:24 and over the company of the tribe of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni.
04 10:25 Then the standard of the camp of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out, company by company, and over the whole company was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04 10:26 Over the company of the tribe of Asher was Pagiel son of Ochran,
04 10:27 and over the company of the tribe of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan.
04 10:28 This was the order of march of the Israelites, company by company, when they set out.
04 10:29 Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you'; come with us, and we will treat you well; for the LORD has promised good to Israel."
04 10:30 But he said to him, "I will not go, but I will go back to my own land and to my kindred."
04 10:31 He said, "Do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.
04 10:32 Moreover, if you go with us, whatever good the LORD does for us, the same we will do for you."
04 10:33 So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey with the ark of the covenant of the LORD going before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them,
04 10:34 the cloud of the LORD being over them by day when they set out from the camp.
04 10:35 Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, "Arise, O LORD, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you."
04 10:36 And whenever it came to rest, he would say, "Return, O LORD of the ten thousand thousands of Israel."
04 11:1 Now when the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes, the LORD heard it and his anger was kindled. Then the fire of the LORD burned against them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
04 11:2 But the people cried out to Moses; and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire abated.
04 11:3 So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned against them.
04 11:4 The rabble among them had a strong craving; and the Israelites also wept again, and said, "If only we had meat to eat!
04 11:5 We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;
04 11:6 but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at."
04 11:7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color was like the color of gum resin.
04 11:8 The people went around and gathered it, ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, then boiled it in pots and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
04 11:9 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna would fall with it.
04 11:10 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, all at the entrances of their tents. Then the LORD became very angry, and Moses was displeased.
04 11:11 So Moses said to the LORD, "Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
04 11:12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, that you should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a sucking child,' to the land that you promised on oath to their ancestors?
04 11:13 Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they come weeping to me and say, 'Give us meat to eat!'
04 11:14 I am not able to carry all this people alone, for they are too heavy for me.
04 11:15 If this is the way you are going to treat me, put me to death at once--if I have found favor in your sight--and do not let me see my misery."
04 11:16 So the LORD said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them take their place there with you.
04 11:17 I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people along with you so that you will not bear it all by yourself.
04 11:18 And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wailed in the hearing of the LORD, saying, 'If only we had meat to eat! Surely it was better for us in Egypt.' Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat.
04 11:19 You shall eat not only one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
04 11:20 but for a whole month--until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you--because you have rejected the LORD who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, 'Why did we ever leave Egypt?'"
04 11:21 But Moses said, "The people I am with number six hundred thousand on foot; and you say, 'I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month'!
04 11:22 Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them? Are there enough fish in the sea to catch for them?"
04 11:23 The LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's power limited? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not."
04 11:24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD; and he gathered seventy elders of the people, and placed them all around the tent.
04 11:25 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do so again.
04 11:26 Two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
04 11:27 And a young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
04 11:28 And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, "My lord Moses, stop them!"
04 11:29 But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!"
04 11:30 And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
04 11:31 Then a wind went out from the LORD, and it brought quails from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits deep on the ground.
04 11:32 So the people worked all that day and night and all the next day, gathering the quails; the least anyone gathered was ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
04 11:33 But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.
04 11:34 So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.
04 11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth.
04 12:1 While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had indeed married a Cushite woman);
04 12:2 and they said, "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" And the LORD heard it.
04 12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth.
04 12:4 Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting." So the three of them came out.
04 12:5 Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.
04 12:6 And he said, "Hear my words: When there are prophets among you, I the LORD make myself known to them in visions; I speak to them in dreams.
04 12:7 Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.
04 12:8 With him I speak face to face--clearly, not in riddles; and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
04 12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.
04 12:10 When the cloud went away from over the tent, Miriam had become leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam and saw that she was leprous.
04 12:11 Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, do not punish us for a sin that we have so foolishly committed.
04 12:12 Do not let her be like one stillborn, whose flesh is half consumed when it comes out of its mother's womb."
04 12:13 And Moses cried to the LORD, "O God, please heal her."
04 12:14 But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp for seven days, and after that she may be brought in again."
04 12:15 So Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days; and the people did not set out on the march until Miriam had been brought in again.
04 12:16 After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
04 13:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04 13:2 "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites; from each of their ancestral tribes you shall send a man, every one a leader among them."
04 13:3 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them leading men among the Israelites.
04 13:4 These were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
04 13:5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
04 13:6 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
04 13:7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
04 13:8 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
04 13:9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
04 13:10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
04 13:11 from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi son of Susi;
04 13:12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
04 13:13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
04 13:14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
04 13:15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.
04 13:16 These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses changed the name of Hoshea son of Nun to Joshua.
04 13:17 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, "Go up there into the Negeb, and go up into the hill country,
04 13:18 and see what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
04 13:19 and whether the land they live in is good or bad, and whether the towns that they live in are unwalled or fortified,
04 13:20 and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be bold, and bring some of the fruit of the land." Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes.
04 13:21 So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.
04 13:22 They went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the Anakites, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
04 13:23 And they came to the Wadi Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them. They also brought some pomegranates and figs.
04 13:24 That place was called the Wadi Eshcol, because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there.
04 13:25 At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
04 13:26 And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
04 13:27 And they told him, "We came to the land to which you sent us; it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
04 13:28 Yet the people who live in the land are strong, and the towns are fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
04 13:29 The Amalekites live in the land of the Negeb; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea, and along the Jordan."
04 13:30 But Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it."
04 13:31 Then the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against this people, for they are stronger than we."
04 13:32 So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out, saying, "The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size.
04 13:33 There we saw the Nephilim (the Anakites come from the Nephilim); and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them."
04 14:1 Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.
04 14:2 And all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron; the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!
04 14:3 Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become booty; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
04 14:4 So they said to one another, "Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt."
04 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites.
04 14:6 And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
04 14:7 and said to all the congregation of the Israelites, "The land that we went through as spies is an exceedingly good land.
04 14:8 If the LORD is pleased with us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.
04 14:9 Only, do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are no more than bread for us; their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."
04 14:10 But the whole congregation threatened to stone them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
04 14:11 And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? And how long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?
04 14:12 I will strike them with pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."
04 14:13 But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for in your might you brought up this people from among them,
04 14:14 and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O LORD, are in the midst of this people; for you, O LORD, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go in front of them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
04 14:15 Now if you kill this people all at one time, then the nations who have heard about you will say,
04 14:16 'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them that he has slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
04 14:17 And now, therefore, let the power of the LORD be great in the way that you promised when you spoke, saying,
04 14:18 'The LORD is slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and the fourth generation.'
04 14:19 Forgive the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have pardoned this people, from Egypt even until now."
04 14:20 Then the LORD said, "I do forgive, just as you have asked;
04 14:21 nevertheless--as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD--
04 14:22 none of the people who have seen my glory and the signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have tested me these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,
04 14:23 shall see the land that I swore to give to their ancestors; none of those who despised me shall see it.
04 14:24 But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me wholeheartedly, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.
04 14:25 Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."
04 14:26 And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
04 14:27 How long shall this wicked congregation complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the Israelites, which they complain against me.
04 14:28 Say to them, "As I live," says the LORD, "I will do to you the very things I heard you say:
04 14:29 your dead bodies shall fall in this very wilderness; and of all your number, included in the census, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me,
04 14:30 not one of you shall come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04 14:31 But your little ones, who you said would become booty, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have despised.
04 14:32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
04 14:33 And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.
04 14:34 According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty years, and you shall know my displeasure."
04 14:35 I the LORD have spoken; surely I will do thus to all this wicked congregation gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.
04 14:36 And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report about the land--
04 14:37 the men who brought an unfavorable report about the land died by a plague before the LORD.
04 14:38 But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh alone remained alive, of those men who went to spy out the land.
04 14:39 When Moses told these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned greatly.
04 14:40 They rose early in the morning and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, "Here we are. We will go up to the place that the LORD has promised, for we have sinned."
04 14:41 But Moses said, "Why do you continue to transgress the command of the LORD? That will not succeed.
04 14:42 Do not go up, for the LORD is not with you; do not let yourselves be struck down before your enemies.
04 14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will confront you there, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned back from following the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."
04 14:44 But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, even though the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, had not left the camp.
04 14:45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and defeated them, pursuing them as far as Hormah.
04 15:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 15:2 Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving you,
04 15:3 and you make an offering by fire to the LORD from the herd or from the flock--whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or at your appointed festivals--to make a pleasing odor for the LORD,
04 15:4 then whoever presents such an offering to the LORD shall present also a grain offering, one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour, mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil.
04 15:5 Moreover, you shall offer one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.
04 15:6 For a ram, you shall offer a grain offering, two-tenths of an ephah of choice flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
04 15:7 and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine, a pleasing odor to the LORD.
04 15:8 When you offer a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as an offering of well-being to the LORD,
04 15:9 then you shall present with the bull a grain offering, three-tenths of an ephah of choice flour, mixed with half a hin of oil,
04 15:10 and you shall present as a drink offering half a hin of wine, as an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.
04 15:11 Thus it shall be done for each ox or ram, or for each of the male lambs or the kids.
04 15:12 According to the number that you offer, so you shall do with each and every one.
04 15:13 Every native Israelite shall do these things in this way, in presenting an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.
04 15:14 An alien who lives with you, or who takes up permanent residence among you, and wishes to offer an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD, shall do as you do.
04 15:15 As for the assembly, there shall be for both you and the resident alien a single statute, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you and the alien shall be alike before the LORD.
04 15:16 You and the alien who resides with you shall have the same law and the same ordinance.
04 15:17 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 15:18 Speak to the Israelites and say to them: After you come into the land to which I am bringing you,
04 15:19 whenever you eat of the bread of the land, you shall present a donation to the LORD.
04 15:20 From your first batch of dough you shall present a loaf as a donation; you shall present it just as you present a donation from the threshing floor.
04 15:21 Throughout your generations you shall give to the LORD a donation from the first of your batch of dough.
04 15:22 But if you unintentionally fail to observe all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses--
04 15:23 everything that the LORD has commanded you by Moses, from the day the LORD gave commandment and thereafter, throughout your generations--
04 15:24 then if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, the whole congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a pleasing odor to the LORD, together with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
04 15:25 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the Israelites, and they shall be forgiven; it was unintentional, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error.
04 15:26 All the congregation of the Israelites shall be forgiven, as well as the aliens residing among them, because the whole people was involved in the error.
04 15:27 An individual who sins unintentionally shall present a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
04 15:28 And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the one who commits an error, when it is unintentional, to make atonement for the person, who then shall be forgiven.
04 15:29 For both the native among the Israelites and the alien residing among them--you shall have the same law for anyone who acts in error.
04 15:30 But whoever acts high-handedly, whether a native or an alien, affronts the LORD, and shall be cut off from among the people.
04 15:31 Because of having despised the word of the LORD and broken his commandment, such a person shall be utterly cut off and bear the guilt.
04 15:32 When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.
04 15:33 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses, Aaron, and to the whole congregation.
04 15:34 They put him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.
04 15:35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him outside the camp."
04 15:36 The whole congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 15:37 The LORD said to Moses:
04 15:38 Speak to the Israelites, and tell them to make fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations and to put a blue cord on the fringe at each corner.
04 15:39 You have the fringe so that, when you see it, you will remember all the commandments of the LORD and do them, and not follow the lust of your own heart and your own eyes.
04 15:40 So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and you shall be holy to your God.
04 15:41 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.
04 16:1 Now Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth--descendants of Reuben--took
04 16:2 two hundred fifty Israelite men, leaders of the congregation, chosen from the assembly, well-known men, and they confronted Moses.
04 16:3 They assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, "You have gone too far! All the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and the LORD is among them. So why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"
04 16:4 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.
04 16:5 Then he said to Korah and all his company, "In the morning the LORD will make known who is his, and who is holy, and who will be allowed to approach him; the one whom he will choose he will allow to approach him.
04 16:6 Do this: take censers, Korah and all your company,
04 16:7 and tomorrow put fire in them, and lay incense on them before the LORD; and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the holy one. You Levites have gone too far!"
04 16:8 Then Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you Levites!
04 16:9 Is it too little for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to allow you to approach him in order to perform the duties of the LORD's tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation and serve them?
04 16:10 He has allowed you to approach him, and all your brother Levites with you; yet you seek the priesthood as well!
04 16:11 Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the LORD. What is Aaron that you rail against him?"
04 16:12 Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab; but they said, "We will not come!
04 16:13 Is it too little that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also lord it over us?
04 16:14 It is clear you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come!"
04 16:15 Moses was very angry and said to the LORD, "Pay no attention to their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed any one of them."
04 16:16 And Moses said to Korah, "As for you and all your company, be present tomorrow before the LORD, you and they and Aaron;
04 16:17 and let each one of you take his censer, and put incense on it, and each one of you present his censer before the LORD, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer."
04 16:18 So each man took his censer, and they put fire in the censers and laid incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
04 16:19 Then Korah assembled the whole congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole congregation.
04 16:20 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
04 16:21 Separate yourselves from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.
04 16:22 They fell on their faces, and said, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one person sin and you become angry with the whole congregation?"
04 16:23 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 16:24 Say to the congregation: Get away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
04 16:25 So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him.
04 16:26 He said to the congregation, "Turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, or you will be swept away for all their sins."
04 16:27 So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, their children, and their little ones.
04 16:28 And Moses said, "This is how you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; it has not been of my own accord:
04 16:29 If these people die a natural death, or if a natural fate comes on them, then the LORD has not sent me.
04 16:30 But if the LORD creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the LORD."
04 16:31 As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground under them was split apart.
04 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households--everyone who belonged to Korah and all their goods.
04 16:33 So they with all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol; the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
04 16:34 All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they said, "The earth will swallow us too!"
04 16:35 And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred fifty men offering the incense.
04 16:36 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 16:37 Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to take the censers out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide.
04 16:38 For the censers of these sinners have become holy at the cost of their lives. Make them into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they presented them before the LORD and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the Israelites.
04 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been presented by those who were burned; and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar--
04 16:40 a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, shall approach to offer incense before the LORD, so as not to become like Korah and his company--just as the LORD had said to him through Moses.
04 16:41 On the next day, however, the whole congregation of the Israelites rebelled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of the LORD."
04 16:42 And when the congregation had assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting; the cloud had covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
04 16:43 Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
04 16:44 and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04 16:45 "Get away from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment." And they fell on their faces.
04 16:46 Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, put fire on it from the altar and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the LORD; the plague has begun."
04 16:47 So Aaron took it as Moses had ordered, and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
04 16:48 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.
04 16:49 Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.
04 16:50 When the plague was stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
04 17:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 17:2 Speak to the Israelites, and get twelve staffs from them, one for each ancestral house, from all the leaders of their ancestral houses. Write each man's name on his staff,
04 17:3 and write Aaron's name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each ancestral house.
04 17:4 Place them in the tent of meeting before the covenant, where I meet with you.
04 17:5 And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout; thus I will put a stop to the complaints of the Israelites that they continually make against you.
04 17:6 Moses spoke to the Israelites; and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their ancestral houses, twelve staffs; and the staff of Aaron was among theirs.
04 17:7 So Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the covenant.
04 17:8 When Moses went into the tent of the covenant on the next day, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted. It put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
04 17:9 Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the Israelites; and they looked, and each man took his staff.
04 17:10 And the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the staff of Aaron before the covenant, to be kept as a warning to rebels, so that you may make an end of their complaints against me, or else they will die."
04 17:11 Moses did so; just as the LORD commanded him, so he did.
04 17:12 The Israelites said to Moses, "We are perishing; we are lost, all of us are lost!
04 17:13 Everyone who approaches the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all to perish?"
04 18:1 The LORD said to Aaron: You and your sons and your ancestral house with you shall bear responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, while you and your sons alone shall bear responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood.
04 18:2 So bring with you also your brothers of the tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, in order that they may be joined to you, and serve you while you and your sons with you are in front of the tent of the covenant.
04 18:3 They shall perform duties for you and for the whole tent. But they must not approach either the utensils of the sanctuary or the altar, otherwise both they and you will die.
04 18:4 They are attached to you in order to perform the duties of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; no outsider shall approach you.
04 18:5 You yourselves shall perform the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar, so that wrath may never again come upon the Israelites.
04 18:6 It is I who now take your brother Levites from among the Israelites; they are now yours as a gift, dedicated to the LORD, to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
04 18:7 But you and your sons with you shall diligently perform your priestly duties in all that concerns the altar and the area behind the curtain. I give your priesthood as a gift; any outsider who approaches shall be put to death.
04 18:8 The LORD spoke to Aaron: I have given you charge of the offerings made to me, all the holy gifts of the Israelites; I have given them to you and your sons as a priestly portion due you in perpetuity.
04 18:9 This shall be yours from the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs that they render to me as a most holy thing, whether grain offering, sin offering, or guilt offering, shall belong to you and your sons.
04 18:10 As a most holy thing you shall eat it; every male may eat it; it shall be holy to you.
04 18:11 This also is yours: I have given to you, together with your sons and daughters, as a perpetual due, whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the elevation offerings of the Israelites; everyone who is clean in your house may eat them.
04 18:12 All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the grain, the choice produce that they give to the LORD, I have given to you.
04 18:13 The first fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house may eat of it.
04 18:14 Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
04 18:15 The first issue of the womb of all creatures, human and animal, which is offered to the LORD, shall be yours; but the firstborn of human beings you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.
04 18:16 Their redemption price, reckoned from one month of age, you shall fix at five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (that is, twenty gerahs).
04 18:17 But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall dash their blood on the altar, and shall turn their fat into smoke as an offering by fire for a pleasing odor to the LORD;
04 18:18 but their flesh shall be yours, just as the breast that is elevated and as the right thigh are yours.
04 18:19 All the holy offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD I have given to you, together with your sons and daughters, as a perpetual due; it is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and your descendants as well.
04 18:20 Then the LORD said to Aaron: You shall have no allotment in their land, nor shall you have any share among them; I am your share and your possession among the Israelites.
04 18:21 To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for a possession in return for the service that they perform, the service in the tent of meeting.
04 18:22 From now on the Israelites shall no longer approach the tent of meeting, or else they will incur guilt and die.
04 18:23 But the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear responsibility for their own offenses; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. But among the Israelites they shall have no allotment,
04 18:24 because I have given to the Levites as their portion the tithe of the Israelites, which they set apart as an offering to the LORD. Therefore I have said of them that they shall have no allotment among the Israelites.
04 18:25 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 18:26 You shall speak to the Levites, saying: When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that I have given you from them for your portion, you shall set apart an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
04 18:27 It shall be reckoned to you as your gift, the same as the grain of the threshing floor and the fullness of the wine press.
04 18:28 Thus you also shall set apart an offering to the LORD from all the tithes that you receive from the Israelites; and from them you shall give the LORD's offering to the priest Aaron.
04 18:29 Out of all the gifts to you, you shall set apart every offering due to the LORD; the best of all of them is the part to be consecrated.
04 18:30 Say also to them: When you have set apart the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the wine press.
04 18:31 You may eat it in any place, you and your households; for it is your payment for your service in the tent of meeting.
04 18:32 You shall incur no guilt by reason of it, when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy gifts of the Israelites, on pain of death.
04 19:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
04 19:2 This is a statute of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect, in which there is no blemish and on which no yoke has been laid.
04 19:3 You shall give it to the priest Eleazar, and it shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04 19:4 The priest Eleazar shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times towards the front of the tent of meeting.
04 19:5 Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its skin, its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned.
04 19:6 The priest shall take cedarwood, hyssop, and crimson material, and throw them into the fire in which the heifer is burning.
04 19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he may come into the camp; but the priest shall remain unclean until evening.
04 19:8 The one who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water; he shall remain unclean until evening.
04 19:9 Then someone who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the Israelites for the water for cleansing. It is a purification offering.
04 19:10 The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. This shall be a perpetual statute for the Israelites and for the alien residing among them.
04 19:11 Those who touch the dead body of any human being shall be unclean seven days.
04 19:12 They shall purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean; but if they do not purify themselves on the third day and on the seventh day, they will not become clean.
04 19:13 All who touch a corpse, the body of a human being who has died, and do not purify themselves, defile the tabernacle of the LORD; such persons shall be cut off from Israel. Since water for cleansing was not dashed on them, they remain unclean; their uncleanness is still on them.
04 19:14 This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
04 19:15 And every open vessel with no cover fastened on it is unclean.
04 19:16 Whoever in the open field touches one who has been killed by a sword, or who has died naturally, or a human bone, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
04 19:17 For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt purification offering, and running water shall be added in a vessel;
04 19:18 then a clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the furnishings, on the persons who were there, and on whoever touched the bone, the slain, the corpse, or the grave.
04 19:19 The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean ones on the third day and on the seventh day, thus purifying them on the seventh day. Then they shall wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and at evening they shall be clean.
04 19:20 Any who are unclean but do not purify themselves, those persons shall be cut off from the assembly, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Since the water for cleansing has not been dashed on them, they are unclean.
04 19:21 It shall be a perpetual statute for them. The one who sprinkles the water for cleansing shall wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for cleansing shall be unclean until evening.
04 19:22 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening.
04 20:1 The Israelites, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died there, and was buried there.
04 20:2 Now there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and against Aaron.
04 20:3 The people quarreled with Moses and said, "Would that we had died when our kindred died before the LORD!
04 20:4 Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
04 20:5 Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to bring us to this wretched place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines, or pomegranates; and there is no water to drink."
04 20:6 Then Moses and Aaron went away from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting; they fell on their faces, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
04 20:7 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 20:8 Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and your brother Aaron, and command the rock before their eyes to yield its water. Thus you shall bring water out of the rock for them; thus you shall provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.
04 20:9 So Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he had commanded him.
04 20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Listen, you rebels, shall we bring water for you out of this rock?"
04 20:11 Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff; water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their livestock drank.
04 20:12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me, to show my holiness before the eyes of the Israelites, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them."
04 20:13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and by which he showed his holiness.
04 20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the adversity that has befallen us:
04 20:15 how our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians oppressed us and our ancestors;
04 20:16 and when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and here we are in Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
04 20:17 Now let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from any well; we will go along the King's Highway, not turning aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory."
04 20:18 But Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through, or we will come out with the sword against you."
04 20:19 The Israelites said to him, "We will stay on the highway; and if we drink of your water, we and our livestock, then we will pay for it. It is only a small matter; just let us pass through on foot."
04 20:20 But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against them with a large force, heavily armed.
04 20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through their territory; so Israel turned away from them.
04 20:22 They set out from Kadesh, and the Israelites, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
04 20:23 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom,
04 20:24 "Let Aaron be gathered to his people. For he shall not enter the land that I have given to the Israelites, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
04 20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and bring them up Mount Hor;
04 20:26 strip Aaron of his vestments, and put them on his son Eleazar. But Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there."
04 20:27 Moses did as the LORD had commanded; they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole congregation.
04 20:28 Moses stripped Aaron of his vestments, and put them on his son Eleazar; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
04 20:29 When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.
04 21:1 When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
04 21:2 Then Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, "If you will indeed give this people into our hands, then we will utterly destroy their towns."
04 21:3 The LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and handed over the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their towns; so the place was called Hormah.
04 21:4 From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; but the people became impatient on the way.
04 21:5 The people spoke against God and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food."
04 21:6 Then the LORD sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died.
04 21:7 The people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD to take away the serpents from us." So Moses prayed for the people.
04 21:8 And the LORD said to Moses, "Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live."
04 21:9 So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.
04 21:10 The Israelites set out, and camped in Oboth.
04 21:11 They set out from Oboth, and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness bordering Moab toward the sunrise.
04 21:12 From there they set out, and camped in the Wadi Zered.
04 21:13 From there they set out, and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
04 21:14 Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, "Waheb in Suphah and the wadis. The Arnon
04 21:15 and the slopes of the wadis that extend to the seat of Ar, and lie along the border of Moab."
04 21:16 From there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
04 21:17 Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well!--Sing to it!--
04 21:18 the well that the leaders sank, that the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, with the staff." From the wilderness to Mattanah,
04 21:19 from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
04 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that overlooks the wasteland.
04 21:21 Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, saying,
04 21:22 "Let me pass through your land; we will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of any well; we will go by the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory."
04 21:23 But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness; he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
04 21:24 Israel put him to the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites; for the boundary of the Ammonites was strong.
04 21:25 Israel took all these towns, and Israel settled in all the towns of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
04 21:26 For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and captured all his land as far as the Arnon.
04 21:27 Therefore the ballad singers say, "Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established.
04 21:28 For fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, and swallowed up the heights of the Arnon.
04 21:29 Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon.
04 21:30 So their posterity perished from Heshbon to Dibon, and we laid waste until fire spread to Medeba."
04 21:31 Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
04 21:32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they captured its villages, and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
04 21:33 Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan; and King Og of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
04 21:34 But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him; for I have given him into your hand, with all his people, and all his land. You shall do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon."
04 21:35 So they killed him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land.
04 22:1 The Israelites set out, and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.
04 22:2 Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
04 22:3 Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were so numerous; Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.
04 22:4 And Moab said to the elders of Midian, "This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
04 22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is on the Euphrates, in the land of Amaw, to summon him, saying, "A people has come out of Egypt; they have spread over the face of the earth, and they have settled next to me.
04 22:6 Come now, curse this people for me, since they are stronger than I; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed."
04 22:7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message.
04 22:8 He said to them, "Stay here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, just as the LORD speaks to me"; so the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam.
04 22:9 God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?"
04 22:10 Balaam said to God, "King Balak son of Zippor of Moab, has sent me this message:
04 22:11 'A people has come out of Egypt and has spread over the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.'"
04 22:12 God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed."
04 22:13 So Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the officials of Balak, "Go to your own land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
04 22:14 So the officials of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
04 22:15 Once again Balak sent officials, more numerous and more distinguished than these.
04 22:16 They came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak son of Zippor: 'Do not let anything hinder you from coming to me;
04 22:17 for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do; come, curse this people for me.'"
04 22:18 But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, "Although Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
04 22:19 You remain here, as the others did, so that I may learn what more the LORD may say to me."
04 22:20 That night God came to Balaam and said to him, "If the men have come to summon you, get up and go with them; but do only what I tell you to do."
04 22:21 So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.
04 22:22 God's anger was kindled because he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the road as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.
04 22:23 The donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand; so the donkey turned off the road, and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn it back onto the road.
04 22:24 Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.
04 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it scraped against the wall, and scraped Balaam's foot against the wall; so he struck it again.
04 22:26 Then the angel of the LORD went ahead, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
04 22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
04 22:28 Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and it said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
04 22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made a fool of me! I wish I had a sword in my hand! I would kill you right now!"
04 22:30 But the donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I been in the habit of treating you this way?" And he said, "No."
04 22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed down, falling on his face.
04 22:32 The angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.
04 22:33 The donkey saw me, and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let it live."
04 22:34 Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now therefore, if it is displeasing to you, I will return home."
04 22:35 The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but speak only what I tell you to speak." So Balaam went on with the officials of Balak.
04 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at Ir-moab, on the boundary formed by the Arnon, at the farthest point of the boundary.
04 22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?"
04 22:38 Balaam said to Balak, "I have come to you now, but do I have power to say just anything? The word God puts in my mouth, that is what I must say."
04 22:39 Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
04 22:40 Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent them to Balaam and to the officials who were with him.
04 22:41 On the next day Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal; and from there he could see part of the people of Israel.
04 23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04 23:2 Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04 23:3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your burnt offerings while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you." And he went to a bare height.
04 23:4 Then God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, "I have arranged the seven altars, and have offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
04 23:5 The LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you must say."
04 23:6 So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.
04 23:7 Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: "Balak has brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: 'Come, curse Jacob for me; Come, denounce Israel!'
04 23:8 How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
04 23:9 For from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I behold him; Here is a people living alone, and not reckoning itself among the nations!
04 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the dust-cloud of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!"
04 23:11 Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but now you have done nothing but bless them."
04 23:12 He answered, "Must I not take care to say what the LORD puts into my mouth?"
04 23:13 So Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only part of them, and shall not see them all; then curse them for me from there."
04 23:14 So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah. He built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offerings, while I meet the LORD over there.
04 23:16 The LORD met Balaam, put a word into his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you shall say."
04 23:17 When he came to him, he was standing beside his burnt offerings with the officials of Moab. Balak said to him, "What has the LORD said?"
04 23:18 Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: "Rise, Balak, and hear; listen to me, O son of Zippor:
04 23:19 God is not a human being, that he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change his mind. Has he promised, and will he not do it? Has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
04 23:20 See, I received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
04 23:21 He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob; nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, acclaimed as a king among them.
04 23:22 God, who brings them out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
04 23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what God has done!'
04 23:24 Look, a people rising up like a lioness, and rousing itself like a lion! It does not lie down until it has eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain."
04 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all."
04 23:26 But Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'Whatever the LORD says, that is what I must do'?"
04 23:27 So Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there."
04 23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.
04 23:29 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04 23:30 So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04 24:1 Now Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, so he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.
04 24:2 Balaam looked up and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe. Then the spirit of God came upon him,
04 24:3 and he uttered his oracle, saying: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is clear,
04 24:4 the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, but with eyes uncovered:
04 24:5 how fair are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!
04 24:6 Like palm-groves that stretch far away, like gardens beside a river, like aloes that the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.
04 24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall have abundant water, his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
04 24:8 God who brings him out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for him; he shall devour the nations that are his foes and break their bones. He shall strike with his arrows.
04 24:9 He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, and cursed is everyone who curses you."
04 24:10 Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but instead you have blessed them these three times.
04 24:11 Now be off with you! Go home! I said, 'I will reward you richly,' but the LORD has denied you any reward."
04 24:12 And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
04 24:13 'If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own will; what the LORD says, that is what I will say'?
04 24:14 So now, I am going to my people; let me advise you what this people will do to your people in days to come."
04 24:15 So he uttered his oracle, saying: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is clear,
04 24:16 the oracle of one who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, but with his eyes uncovered:
04 24:17 I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near--a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the borderlands of Moab, and the territory of all the Shethites.
04 24:18 Edom will become a possession, Seir a possession of its enemies, while Israel does valiantly.
04 24:19 One out of Jacob shall rule, and destroy the survivors of Ir."
04 24:20 Then he looked on Amalek, and uttered his oracle, saying: "First among the nations was Amalek, but its end is to perish forever."
04 24:21 Then he looked on the Kenite, and uttered his oracle, saying: "Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;
04 24:22 yet Kain is destined for burning. How long shall Asshur take you away captive?"
04 24:23 Again he uttered his oracle, saying: "Alas, who shall live when God does this?
04 24:24 But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber; and he also shall perish forever."
04 24:25 Then Balaam got up and went back to his place, and Balak also went his way.
04 25:1 While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people began to have sexual relations with the women of Moab.
04 25:2 These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
04 25:3 Thus Israel yoked itself to the Baal of Peor, and the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel.
04 25:4 The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and impale them in the sun before the LORD, in order that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel."
04 25:5 And Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you shall kill any of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor."
04 25:6 Just then one of the Israelites came and brought a Midianite woman into his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the Israelites, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
04 25:7 When Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he got up and left the congregation. Taking a spear in his hand,
04 25:8 he went after the Israelite man into the tent, and pierced the two of them, the Israelite and the woman, through the belly. So the plague was stopped among the people of Israel.
04 25:9 Nevertheless those that died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
04 25:10 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 25:11 "Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the Israelites by manifesting such zeal among them on my behalf that in my jealousy I did not consume the Israelites.
04 25:12 Therefore say, 'I hereby grant him my covenant of peace.
04 25:13 It shall be for him and for his descendants after him a covenant of perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the Israelites.'"
04 25:14 The name of the slain Israelite man, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri son of Salu, head of an ancestral house belonging to the Simeonites.
04 25:15 The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi daughter of Zur, who was the head of a clan, an ancestral house in Midian.
04 25:16 The LORD said to Moses,
04 25:17 "Harass the Midianites, and defeat them;
04 25:18 for they have harassed you by the trickery with which they deceived you in the affair of Peor, and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of a leader of Midian, their sister; she was killed on the day of the plague that resulted from Peor."
04 26:1 After the plague the LORD said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
04 26:2 "Take a census of the whole congregation of the Israelites, from twenty years old and upward, by their ancestral houses, everyone in Israel able to go to war."
04 26:3 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
04 26:4 "Take a census of the people, from twenty years old and upward," as the LORD commanded Moses. The Israelites, who came out of the land of Egypt, were:
04 26:5 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel. The descendants of Reuben: of Hanoch, the clan of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites;
04 26:6 of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites.
04 26:7 These are the clans of the Reubenites; the number of those enrolled was forty-three thousand seven hundred thirty.
04 26:8 And the descendants of Pallu: Eliab.
04 26:9 The descendants of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram, chosen from the congregation, who rebelled against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they rebelled against the LORD,
04 26:10 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred fifty men; and they became a warning.
04 26:11 Notwithstanding, the sons of Korah did not die.
04 26:12 The descendants of Simeon by their clans: of Nemuel, the clan of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the clan of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the clan of the Jachinites;
04 26:13 of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites; of Shaul, the clan of the Shaulites.
04 26:14 These are the clans of the Simeonites, twenty-two thousand two hundred.
04 26:15 The children of Gad by their clans: of Zephon, the clan of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the clan of the Haggites; of Shuni, the clan of the Shunites;

04 26:17 of Arod, the clan of the Arodites; of Areli, the clan of the Arelites.
04 26:18 These are the clans of the Gadites: the number of those enrolled was forty thousand five hundred.
04 26:19 The sons of Judah: Er and Onan; Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
04 26:20 The descendants of Judah by their clans were: of Shelah, the clan of the Shelanites; of Perez, the clan of the Perezites; of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites.
04 26:21 The descendants of Perez were: of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the clan of the Hamulites.
04 26:22 These are the clans of Judah: the number of those enrolled was seventy-six thousand five hundred.
04 26:23 The descendants of Issachar by their clans: of Tola, the clan of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the clan of the Punites;
04 26:24 of Jashub, the clan of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the clan of the Shimronites.
04 26:25 These are the clans of Issachar: sixty-four thousand three hundred enrolled.
04 26:26 The descendants of Zebulun by their clans: of Sered, the clan of the Seredites; of Elon, the clan of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the clan of the Jahleelites.
04 26:27 These are the clans of the Zebulunites; the number of those enrolled was sixty thousand five hundred.
04 26:28 The sons of Joseph by their clans: Manasseh and Ephraim.
04 26:29 The descendants of Manasseh: of Machir, the clan of the Machirites; and Machir was the father of Gilead; of Gilead, the clan of the Gileadites.
04 26:30 These are the descendants of Gilead: of Iezer, the clan of the Iezerites; of Helek, the clan of the Helekites;
04 26:31 and of Asriel, the clan of the Asrielites; and of Shechem, the clan of the Shechemites;
04 26:32 and of Shemida, the clan of the Shemidaites; and of Hepher, the clan of the Hepherites.
04 26:33 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
04 26:34 These are the clans of Manasseh; the number of those enrolled was fifty-two thousand seven hundred.
04 26:35 These are the descendants of Ephraim according to their clans: of Shuthelah, the clan of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the clan of the Becherites; of Tahan, the clan of the Tahanites.
04 26:36 And these are the descendants of Shuthelah: of Eran, the clan of the Eranites.
04 26:37 These are the clans of the Ephraimites: the number of those enrolled was thirty-two thousand five hundred. These are the descendants of Joseph by their clans.
04 26:38 The descendants of Benjamin by their clans: of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the clan of the Ahiramites;
04 26:39 of Shephupham, the clan of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the clan of the Huphamites.
04 26:40 And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the clan of the Ardites; of Naaman, the clan of the Naamites.
04 26:41 These are the descendants of Benjamin by their clans; the number of those enrolled was forty-five thousand six hundred.
04 26:42 These are the descendants of Dan by their clans: of Shuham, the clan of the Shuhamites. These are the clans of Dan by their clans.
04 26:43 All the clans of the Shuhamites: sixty-four thousand four hundred enrolled.
04 26:44 The descendants of Asher by their families: of Imnah, the clan of the Imnites; of Ishvi, the clan of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the clan of the Beriites.
04 26:45 Of the descendants of Beriah: of Heber, the clan of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the clan of the Malchielites.
04 26:46 And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serah.
04 26:47 These are the clans of the Asherites: the number of those enrolled was fifty-three thousand four hundred.
04 26:48 The descendants of Naphtali by their clans: of Jahzeel, the clan of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the clan of the Gunites;
04 26:49 of Jezer, the clan of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the clan of the Shillemites.
04 26:50 These are the Naphtalites by their clans: the number of those enrolled was forty-five thousand four hundred.
04 26:51 This was the number of the Israelites enrolled: six hundred and one thousand seven hundred thirty.
04 26:52 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 26:53 To these the land shall be apportioned for inheritance according to the number of names.
04 26:54 To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance; every tribe shall be given its inheritance according to its enrollment.
04 26:55 But the land shall be apportioned by lot; according to the names of their ancestral tribes they shall inherit.
04 26:56 Their inheritance shall be apportioned according to lot between the larger and the smaller.
04 26:57 This is the enrollment of the Levites by their clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites.
04 26:58 These are the clans of Levi: the clan of the Libnites, the clan of the Hebronites, the clan of the Mahlites, the clan of the Mushites, the clan of the Korahites. Now Kohath was the father of Amram.
04 26:59 The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.
04 26:60 To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
04 26:61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered illicit fire before the LORD.
04 26:62 The number of those enrolled was twenty-three thousand, every male one month old and up; for they were not enrolled among the Israelites because there was no allotment given to them among the Israelites.
04 26:63 These were those enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who enrolled the Israelites in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
04 26:64 Among these there was not one of those enrolled by Moses and Aaron the priest, who had enrolled the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai.
04 26:65 For the LORD had said of them, "They shall die in the wilderness." Not one of them was left, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04 27:1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad came forward. Zelophehad was son of Hepher son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh son of Joseph, a member of the Manassite clans. The names of his daughters were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
04 27:2 They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and they said,
04 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons.
04 27:4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father's brothers."
04 27:5 Moses brought their case before the LORD.
04 27:6 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 27:7 The daughters of Zelophehad are right in what they are saying; you shall indeed let them possess an inheritance among their father's brothers and pass the inheritance of their father on to them.
04 27:8 You shall also say to the Israelites, "If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance on to his daughter.
04 27:9 If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
04 27:10 If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
04 27:11 And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest kinsman of his clan, and he shall possess it. It shall be for the Israelites a statute and ordinance, as the LORD commanded Moses."
04 27:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Go up this mountain of the Abarim range, and see the land that I have given to the Israelites.
04 27:13 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
04 27:14 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin when the congregation quarreled with me. You did not show my holiness before their eyes at the waters." (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
04 27:15 Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
04 27:16 "Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint someone over the congregation
04 27:17 who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD may not be like sheep without a shepherd."
04 27:18 So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand upon him;
04 27:19 have him stand before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation, and commission him in their sight.
04 27:20 You shall give him some of your authority, so that all the congregation of the Israelites may obey.
04 27:21 But he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the decision of the Urim before the LORD; at his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the Israelites with him, the whole congregation."
04 27:22 So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation;
04 27:23 he laid his hands on him and commissioned him--as the LORD had directed through Moses.
04 28:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 28:2 Command the Israelites, and say to them: My offering, the food for my offerings by fire, my pleasing odor, you shall take care to offer to me at its appointed time.
04 28:3 And you shall say to them, This is the offering by fire that you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs a year old without blemish, daily, as a regular offering.
04 28:4 One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight
04 28:5 also one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour for a grain offering, mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil.
04 28:6 It is a regular burnt offering, ordained at Mount Sinai for a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
04 28:7 Its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in the sanctuary you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD.
04 28:8 The other lamb you shall offer at twilight with a grain offering and a drink offering like the one in the morning; you shall offer it as an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.
04 28:9 On the sabbath day: two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of choice flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering--
04 28:10 this is the burnt offering for every sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04 28:11 At the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
04 28:12 also three-tenths of an ephah of choice flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two-tenths of choice flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
04 28:13 and one-tenth of choice flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for every lamb--a burnt offering of pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
04 28:14 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
04 28:15 And there shall be one male goat for a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04 28:16 On the fourteenth day of the first month there shall be a passover offering to the LORD.
04 28:17 And on the fifteenth day of this month is a festival; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
04 28:18 On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall not work at your occupations.
04 28:19 You shall offer an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; see that they are without blemish.
04 28:20 Their grain offering shall be of choice flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah shall you offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram;
04 28:21 one-tenth shall you offer for each of the seven lambs;
04 28:22 also one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
04 28:23 You shall offer these in addition to the burnt offering of the morning, which belongs to the regular burnt offering.
04 28:24 In the same way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD; it shall be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04 28:25 And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.
04 28:26 On the day of the first fruits, when you offer a grain offering of new grain to the LORD at your festival of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.
04 28:27 You shall offer a burnt offering, a pleasing odor to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old.
04 28:28 Their grain offering shall be of choice flour mixed with oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for one ram,
04 28:29 one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
04 28:30 with one male goat, to make atonement for you.
04 28:31 In addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, you shall offer them and their drink offering. They shall be without blemish.
04 29:1 On the first day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations. It is a day for you to blow the trumpets,
04 29:2 and you shall offer a burnt offering, a pleasing odor to the LORD: one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish.
04 29:3 Their grain offering shall be of choice flour mixed with oil, three-tenths of one ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
04 29:4 and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
04 29:5 with one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
04 29:6 These are in addition to the burnt offering of the new moon and its grain offering, and the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to the ordinance for them, a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the LORD.
04 29:7 On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and deny yourselves; you shall do no work.
04 29:8 You shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing odor: one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old. They shall be without blemish.
04 29:9 Their grain offering shall be of choice flour mixed with oil, three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
04 29:10 one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
04 29:11 with one male goat for a sin offering, in addition to the sin offering of atonement, and the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
04 29:12 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations. You shall celebrate a festival to the LORD seven days.
04 29:13 You shall offer a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD: thirteen young bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old. They shall be without blemish.
04 29:14 Their grain offering shall be of choice flour mixed with oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams,
04 29:15 and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs;
04 29:16 also one male goat for a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering, its grain offering and its drink offering.
04 29:17 On the second day: twelve young bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish,

04 29:31 also one male goat for a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offerings.
04 29:32 On the seventh day: seven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish,
04 29:33 with the grain offering and the drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, as prescribed in accordance with their number;
04 29:34 also one male goat for a sin offering, besides the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.
04 29:35 On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your occupations.
04 29:36 You shall offer a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD: one bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish,
04 29:37 and the grain offering and the drink offerings for the bull, for the ram, and for the lambs, as prescribed in accordance with their number;
04 29:38 also one male goat for a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering and its drink offering.
04 29:39 These you shall offer to the LORD at your appointed festivals, in addition to your votive offerings and your freewill offerings, as your burnt offerings, your grain offerings, your drink offerings, and your offerings of well-being.
04 29:40 So Moses told the Israelites everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 30:1 Then Moses said to the heads of the tribes of the Israelites: This is what the LORD has commanded.
04 30:2 When a man makes a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
04 30:3 When a woman makes a vow to the LORD, or binds herself by a pledge, while within her father's house, in her youth,
04 30:4 and her father hears of her vow or her pledge by which she has bound herself, and says nothing to her; then all her vows shall stand, and any pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
04 30:5 But if her father expresses disapproval to her at the time that he hears of it, no vow of hers, and no pledge by which she has bound herself, shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father had expressed to her his disapproval.
04 30:6 If she marries, while obligated by her vows or any thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,
04 30:7 and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her at the time that he hears, then her vows shall stand, and her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand.
04 30:8 But if, at the time that her husband hears of it, he expresses disapproval to her, then he shall nullify the vow by which she was obligated, or the thoughtless utterance of her lips, by which she bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her.
04 30:9 (But every vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall be binding upon her.)
04 30:10 And if she made a vow in her husband's house, or bound herself by a pledge with an oath,
04 30:11 and her husband heard it and said nothing to her, and did not express disapproval to her, then all her vows shall stand, and any pledge by which she bound herself shall stand.
04 30:12 But if her husband nullifies them at the time that he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning her pledge of herself, shall not stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will forgive her.
04 30:13 Any vow or any binding oath to deny herself, her husband may allow to stand, or her husband may nullify.
04 30:14 But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he validates all her vows, or all her pledges, by which she is obligated; he has validated them, because he said nothing to her at the time that he heard of them.
04 30:15 But if he nullifies them some time after he has heard of them, then he shall bear her guilt.
04 30:16 These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses concerning a husband and his wife, and a father and his daughter while she is still young and in her father's house.
04 31:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04 31:2 "Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
04 31:3 So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your number for the war, so that they may go against Midian, to execute the LORD's vengeance on Midian.
04 31:4 You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war."
04 31:5 So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were conscripted, twelve thousand armed for battle.
04 31:6 Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the alarm in his hand.
04 31:7 They did battle against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed every male.
04 31:8 They killed the kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian, in addition to others who were slain by them; and they also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
04 31:9 The Israelites took the women of Midian and their little ones captive; and they took all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods as booty.
04 31:10 All their towns where they had settled, and all their encampments, they burned,
04 31:11 but they took all the spoil and all the booty, both people and animals.
04 31:12 Then they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the Israelites, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
04 31:13 Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
04 31:14 Moses became angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
04 31:15 Moses said to them, "Have you allowed all the women to live?
04 31:16 These women here, on Balaam's advice, made the Israelites act treacherously against the LORD in the affair of Peor, so that the plague came among the congregation of the LORD.
04 31:17 Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by sleeping with him.
04 31:18 But all the young girls who have not known a man by sleeping with him, keep alive for yourselves.
04 31:19 Camp outside the camp seven days; whoever of you has killed any person or touched a corpse, purify yourselves and your captives on the third and on the seventh day.
04 31:20 You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, everything made of goats' hair, and every article of wood."
04 31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the troops who had gone to battle: "This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
04 31:22 gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead--
04 31:23 everything that can withstand fire, shall be passed through fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall also be purified with the water for purification; and whatever cannot withstand fire, shall be passed through the water.
04 31:24 You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; afterward you may come into the camp."
04 31:25 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04 31:26 "You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the ancestral houses of the congregation make an inventory of the booty captured, both human and animal.
04 31:27 Divide the booty into two parts, between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
04 31:28 From the share of the warriors who went out to battle, set aside as tribute for the LORD, one item out of every five hundred, whether persons, oxen, donkeys, sheep, or goats.
04 31:29 Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
04 31:30 But from the Israelites' half you shall take one out of every fifty, whether persons, oxen, donkeys, sheep, or goats--all the animals--and give them to the Levites who have charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
04 31:31 Then Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD had commanded Moses:
04 31:32 The booty remaining from the spoil that the troops had taken totaled six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
04 31:33 seventy-two thousand oxen,
04 31:34 sixty-one thousand donkeys,
04 31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, women who had not known a man by sleeping with him.
04 31:36 The half-share, the portion of those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats,
04 31:37 and the LORD's tribute of sheep and goats was six hundred seventy-five.
04 31:38 The oxen were thirty-six thousand, of which the LORD's tribute was seventy-two.
04 31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the LORD's tribute was sixty-one.
04 31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand, of which the LORD's tribute was thirty-two persons.
04 31:41 Moses gave the tribute, the offering for the LORD, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 31:42 As for the Israelites' half, which Moses separated from that of the troops,
04 31:43 the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats,
04 31:44 thirty-six thousand oxen,
04 31:45 thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
04 31:46 and sixteen thousand persons.
04 31:47 From the Israelites' half Moses took one of every fifty, both of persons and of animals, and gave them to the Levites who had charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 31:48 Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moses,
04 31:49 and said to Moses, "Your servants have counted the warriors who are under our command, and not one of us is missing.
04 31:50 And we have brought the LORD's offering, what each of us found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and pendants, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
04 31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all in the form of crafted articles.
04 31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
04 31:53 (The troops had all taken plunder for themselves.)
04 31:54 So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
04 32:1 Now the Reubenites and the Gadites owned a very great number of cattle. When they saw that the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was a good place for cattle,
04 32:2 the Gadites and the Reubenites came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
04 32:3 "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon--
04 32:4 the land that the LORD subdued before the congregation of Israel--is a land for cattle; and your servants have cattle."
04 32:5 They continued, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not make us cross the Jordan."
04 32:6 But Moses said to the Gadites and to the Reubenites, "Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?
04 32:7 Why will you discourage the hearts of the Israelites from going over into the land that the LORD has given them?
04 32:8 Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
04 32:9 When they went up to the Wadi Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the hearts of the Israelites from going into the land that the LORD had given them.
04 32:10 The LORD's anger was kindled on that day and he swore, saying,
04 32:11 'Surely none of the people who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not unreservedly followed me--
04 32:12 none except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have unreservedly followed the LORD.'
04 32:13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD had disappeared.
04 32:14 And now you, a brood of sinners, have risen in place of your fathers, to increase the LORD's fierce anger against Israel!
04 32:15 If you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
04 32:16 Then they came up to him and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks, and towns for our little ones,
04 32:17 but we will take up arms as a vanguard before the Israelites, until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our little ones will stay in the fortified towns because of the inhabitants of the land.
04 32:18 We will not return to our homes until all the Israelites have obtained their inheritance.
04 32:19 We will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east."
04 32:20 So Moses said to them, "If you do this--if you take up arms to go before the LORD for the war,
04 32:21 and all those of you who bear arms cross the Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him
04 32:22 and the land is subdued before the LORD--then after that you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
04 32:23 But if you do not do this, you have sinned against the LORD; and be sure your sin will find you out.
04 32:24 Build towns for your little ones, and folds for your flocks; but do what you have promised."
04 32:25 Then the Gadites and the Reubenites said to Moses, "Your servants will do as my lord commands.
04 32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall remain there in the towns of Gilead;
04 32:27 but your servants will cross over, everyone armed for war, to do battle for the LORD, just as my lord orders."
04 32:28 So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the ancestral houses of the Israelite tribes.
04 32:29 And Moses said to them, "If the Gadites and the Reubenites, everyone armed for battle before the LORD, will cross over the Jordan with you and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
04 32:30 but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
04 32:31 The Gadites and the Reubenites answered, "As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do.
04 32:32 We will cross over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan."
04 32:33 Moses gave to them--to the Gadites and to the Reubenites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph--the kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites and the kingdom of King Og of Bashan, the land and its towns, with the territories of the surrounding towns.
04 32:34 And the Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
04 32:35 Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
04 32:36 Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
04 32:37 And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
04 32:38 Nebo, and Baal-meon (some names being changed), and Sibmah; and they gave names to the towns that they rebuilt.
04 32:39 The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were there;
04 32:40 so Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there.
04 32:41 Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and renamed them Havvoth-jair.
04 32:42 And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and renamed it Nobah after himself.
04 33:1 These are the stages by which the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt in military formation under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04 33:2 Moses wrote down their starting points, stage by stage, by command of the LORD; and these are their stages according to their starting places.
04 33:3 They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the passover the Israelites went out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,
04 33:4 while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD executed judgments even against their gods.
04 33:5 So the Israelites set out from Rameses, and camped at Succoth.
04 33:6 They set out from Succoth, and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
04 33:7 They set out from Etham, and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon; and they camped before Migdol.
04 33:8 They set out from Pi-hahiroth, passed through the sea into the wilderness, went a three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and camped at Marah.
04 33:9 They set out from Marah and came to Elim; at Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
04 33:10 They set out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
04 33:11 They set out from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
04 33:12 They set out from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
04 33:13 They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
04 33:14 They set out from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
04 33:15 They set out from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
04 33:16 They set out from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
04 33:17 They set out from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
04 33:18 They set out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
04 33:19 They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
04 33:20 They set out from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
04 33:21 They set out from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
04 33:22 They set out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
04 33:23 They set out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
04 33:24 They set out from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
04 33:25 They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
04 33:26 They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
04 33:27 They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah.
04 33:28 They set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
04 33:29 They set out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
04 33:30 They set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
04 33:31 They set out from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
04 33:32 They set out from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
04 33:33 They set out from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
04 33:34 They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
04 33:35 They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
04 33:36 They set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin (that is, Kadesh).
04 33:37 They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom.
04 33:38 Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor at the command of the LORD and died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
04 33:39 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
04 33:40 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the Israelites.
04 33:41 They set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
04 33:42 They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
04 33:43 They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth.
04 33:44 They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the territory of Moab.
04 33:45 They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
04 33:46 They set out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
04 33:47 They set out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
04 33:48 They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho;
04 33:49 they camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
04 33:50 In the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 33:51 Speak to the Israelites, and say to them: When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04 33:52 you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their figured stones, destroy all their cast images, and demolish all their high places.
04 33:53 You shall take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
04 33:54 You shall apportion the land by lot according to your clans; to a large one you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small one you shall give a small inheritance; the inheritance shall belong to the person on whom the lot falls; according to your ancestral tribes you shall inherit.
04 33:55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those whom you let remain shall be as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they shall trouble you in the land where you are settling.
04 33:56 And I will do to you as I thought to do to them.
04 34:1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 34:2 Command the Israelites, and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan, defined by its boundaries),
04 34:3 your south sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom. Your southern boundary shall begin from the end of the Dead Sea on the east;
04 34:4 your boundary shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and cross to Zin, and its outer limit shall be south of Kadesh-barnea; then it shall go on to Hazar-addar, and cross to Azmon;
04 34:5 the boundary shall turn from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the Sea.
04 34:6 For the western boundary, you shall have the Great Sea and its coast; this shall be your western boundary.
04 34:7 This shall be your northern boundary: from the Great Sea you shall mark out your line to Mount Hor;
04 34:8 from Mount Hor you shall mark it out to Lebo-hamath, and the outer limit of the boundary shall be at Zedad;
04 34:9 then the boundary shall extend to Ziphron, and its end shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your northern boundary.
04 34:10 You shall mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham;
04 34:11 and the boundary shall continue down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the boundary shall go down, and reach the eastern slope of the sea of Chinnereth;
04 34:12 and the boundary shall go down to the Jordan, and its end shall be at the Dead Sea. This shall be your land with its boundaries all around.
04 34:13 Moses commanded the Israelites, saying: This is the land that you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe;
04 34:14 for the tribe of the Reubenites by their ancestral houses and the tribe of the Gadites by their ancestral houses have taken their inheritance, and also the half-tribe of Manasseh;
04 34:15 the two tribes and the half-tribe have taken their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.
04 34:16 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 34:17 These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance: the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun.
04 34:18 You shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance.
04 34:19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
04 34:20 Of the tribe of the Simeonites, Shemuel son of Ammihud.
04 34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon.
04 34:22 Of the tribe of the Danites a leader, Bukki son of Jogli.
04 34:23 Of the Josephites: of the tribe of the Manassites a leader, Hanniel son of Ephod,
04 34:24 and of the tribe of the Ephraimites a leader, Kemuel son of Shiphtan.
04 34:25 Of the tribe of the Zebulunites a leader, Eli-zaphan son of Parnach.
04 34:26 Of the tribe of the Issacharites a leader, Paltiel son of Azzan.
04 34:27 And of the tribe of the Asherites a leader, Ahihud son of Shelomi.
04 34:28 Of the tribe of the Naphtalites a leader, Pedahel son of Ammihud.
04 34:29 These were the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance for the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
04 35:1 In the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 35:2 Command the Israelites to give, from the inheritance that they possess, towns for the Levites to live in; you shall also give to the Levites pasture lands surrounding the towns.
04 35:3 The towns shall be theirs to live in, and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle, for their livestock, and for all their animals.
04 35:4 The pasture lands of the towns, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the town outward a thousand cubits all around.
04 35:5 You shall measure, outside the town, for the east side two thousand cubits, for the south side two thousand cubits, for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, with the town in the middle; this shall belong to them as pasture land for their towns.
04 35:6 The towns that you give to the Levites shall include the six cities of refuge, where you shall permit a slayer to flee, and in addition to them you shall give forty-two towns.
04 35:7 The towns that you give to the Levites shall total forty-eight, with their pasture lands.
04 35:8 And as for the towns that you shall give from the possession of the Israelites, from the larger tribes you shall take many, and from the smaller tribes you shall take few; each, in proportion to the inheritance that it obtains, shall give of its towns to the Levites.
04 35:9 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
04 35:10 Speak to the Israelites, and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04 35:11 then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you, so that a slayer who kills a person without intent may flee there.
04 35:12 The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, so that the slayer may not die until there is a trial before the congregation.
04 35:13 The cities that you designate shall be six cities of refuge for you:
04 35:14 you shall designate three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities in the land of Canaan, to be cities of refuge.
04 35:15 These six cities shall serve as refuge for the Israelites, for the resident or transient alien among them, so that anyone who kills a person without intent may flee there.
04 35:16 But anyone who strikes another with an iron object, and death ensues, is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04 35:17 Or anyone who strikes another with a stone in hand that could cause death, and death ensues, is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04 35:18 Or anyone who strikes another with a weapon of wood in hand that could cause death, and death ensues, is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04 35:19 The avenger of blood is the one who shall put the murderer to death; when they meet, the avenger of blood shall execute the sentence.
04 35:20 Likewise, if someone pushes another from hatred, or hurls something at another, lying in wait, and death ensues,
04 35:21 or in enmity strikes another with the hand, and death ensues, then the one who struck the blow shall be put to death; that person is a murderer; the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when they meet.
04 35:22 But if someone pushes another suddenly without enmity, or hurls any object without lying in wait,
04 35:23 or, while handling any stone that could cause death, unintentionally drops it on another and death ensues, though they were not enemies, and no harm was intended,
04 35:24 then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood, in accordance with these ordinances;
04 35:25 and the congregation shall rescue the slayer from the avenger of blood. Then the congregation shall send the slayer back to the original city of refuge. The slayer shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
04 35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time go outside the bounds of the original city of refuge,
04 35:27 and is found by the avenger of blood outside the bounds of the city of refuge, and is killed by the avenger, no bloodguilt shall be incurred.
04 35:28 For the slayer must remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the slayer may return home.
04 35:29 These things shall be a statute and ordinance for you throughout your generations wherever you live.
04 35:30 If anyone kills another, the murderer shall be put to death on the evidence of witnesses; but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of a single witness.
04 35:31 Moreover you shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer who is subject to the death penalty; a murderer must be put to death.
04 35:32 Nor shall you accept ransom for one who has fled to a city of refuge, enabling the fugitive to return to live in the land before the death of the high priest.
04 35:33 You shall not pollute the land in which you live; for blood pollutes the land, and no expiation can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
04 35:34 You shall not defile the land in which you live, in which I also dwell; for I the LORD dwell among the Israelites.
04 36:1 The heads of the ancestral houses of the clans of the descendants of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, of the Josephite clans, came forward and spoke in the presence of Moses and the leaders, the heads of the ancestral houses of the Israelites;
04 36:2 they said, "The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the Israelites; and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
04 36:3 But if they are married into another Israelite tribe, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our ancestors and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so it will be taken away from the alloted portion of our inheritance.
04 36:4 And when the jubilee of the Israelites comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they have married; and their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe."
04 36:5 Then Moses commanded the Israelites according to the word of the LORD, saying, "The descendants of the tribe of Joseph are right in what they are saying.
04 36:6 This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, 'Let them marry whom they think best; only it must be into a clan of their father's tribe that they are married,
04 36:7 so that no inheritance of the Israelites shall be transferred from one tribe to another; for all Israelites shall retain the inheritance of their ancestral tribes.
04 36:8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the Israelites shall marry one from the clan of her father's tribe, so that all Israelites may continue to possess their ancestral inheritance.
04 36:9 No inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another; for each of the tribes of the Israelites shall retain its own inheritance.'"
04 36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04 36:11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married sons of their father's brothers.
04 36:12 They were married into the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father's clan.
04 36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances that the LORD commanded through Moses to the Israelites in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
