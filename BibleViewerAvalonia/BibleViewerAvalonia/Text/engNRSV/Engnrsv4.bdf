18
18¿é 1:1 There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
18¿é 1:2 There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
18¿é 1:3 He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
18¿é 1:4 His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another's houses in turn; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18¿é 1:5 And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." This is what Job always did.
18¿é 1:6 One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
18¿é 1:7 The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
18¿é 1:8 The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil."
18¿é 1:9 Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18¿é 1:10 Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18¿é 1:11 But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."
18¿é 1:12 The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him!" So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
18¿é 1:13 One day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the eldest brother's house,
18¿é 1:14 a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them,
18¿é 1:15 and the Sabeans fell on them and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:16 While he was still speaking, another came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:17 While he was still speaking, another came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three columns, made a raid on the camels and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:18 While he was still speaking, another came and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,
18¿é 1:19 and suddenly a great wind came across the desert, struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:20 Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground and worshiped.
18¿é 1:21 He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
18¿é 1:22 In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong-doing.
18¿é 2:1 One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
18¿é 2:2 The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
18¿é 2:3 The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason."
18¿é 2:4 Then Satan answered the LORD, "Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives.
18¿é 2:5 But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."
18¿é 2:6 The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life."
18¿é 2:7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
18¿é 2:8 Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.
18¿é 2:9 Then his wife said to him, "Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die."
18¿é 2:10 But he said to her, "You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not receive the bad?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
18¿é 2:11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all these troubles that had come upon him, each of them set out from his home--Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to go and console and comfort him.
18¿é 2:12 When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept aloud; they tore their robes and threw dust in the air upon their heads.
18¿é 2:13 They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
18¿é 3:1 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18¿é 3:2 Job said:
18¿é 3:3 "Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man-child is conceived.'
18¿é 3:4 Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, or light shine on it.
18¿é 3:5 Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds settle upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
18¿é 3:6 That night--let thick darkness seize it! let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
18¿é 3:7 Yes, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry be heard in it.
18¿é 3:8 Let those curse it who curse the Sea, those who are skilled to rouse up Leviathan.
18¿é 3:9 Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none; may it not see the eyelids of the morning--
18¿é 3:10 because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, and hide trouble from my eyes.
18¿é 3:11 "Why did I not die at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?
18¿é 3:12 Why were there knees to receive me, or breasts for me to suck?
18¿é 3:13 Now I would be lying down and quiet; I would be asleep; then I would be at rest
18¿é 3:14 with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuild ruins for themselves,
18¿é 3:15 or with princes who have gold, who fill their houses with silver.
18¿é 3:16 Or why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like an infant that never sees the light?
18¿é 3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
18¿é 3:18 There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
18¿é 3:19 The small and the great are there, and the slaves are free from their masters.
18¿é 3:20 "Why is light given to one in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
18¿é 3:21 who long for death, but it does not come, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;
18¿é 3:22 who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they find the grave?
18¿é 3:23 Why is light given to one who cannot see the way, whom God has fenced in?
18¿é 3:24 For my sighing comes like my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.
18¿é 3:25 Truly the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.
18¿é 3:26 I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest; but trouble comes."
18¿é 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
18¿é 4:2 "If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended? But who can keep from speaking?
18¿é 4:3 See, you have instructed many; you have strengthened the weak hands.
18¿é 4:4 Your words have supported those who were stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.
18¿é 4:5 But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
18¿é 4:6 Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?
18¿é 4:7 "Think now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?
18¿é 4:8 As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
18¿é 4:9 By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
18¿é 4:10 The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.
18¿é 4:11 The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
18¿é 4:12 "Now a word came stealing to me, my ear received the whisper of it.
18¿é 4:13 Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on mortals,
18¿é 4:14 dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
18¿é 4:15 A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh bristled.
18¿é 4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:
18¿é 4:17 'Can mortals be righteous before God? Can human beings be pure before their Maker?
18¿é 4:18 Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;
18¿é 4:19 how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth.
18¿é 4:20 Between morning and evening they are destroyed; they perish forever without any regarding it.
18¿é 4:21 Their tent-cord is plucked up within them, and they die devoid of wisdom.'
18¿é 5:1 "Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
18¿é 5:2 Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.
18¿é 5:3 I have seen fools taking root, but suddenly I cursed their dwelling.
18¿é 5:4 Their children are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.
18¿é 5:5 The hungry eat their harvest, and they take it even out of the thorns; and the thirsty pant after their wealth.
18¿é 5:6 For misery does not come from the earth, nor does trouble sprout from the ground;
18¿é 5:7 but human beings are born to trouble just as sparks fly upward.
18¿é 5:8 "As for me, I would seek God, and to God I would commit my cause.
18¿é 5:9 He does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number.
18¿é 5:10 He gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
18¿é 5:11 he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
18¿é 5:12 He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
18¿é 5:13 He takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
18¿é 5:14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.
18¿é 5:15 But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, from the hand of the mighty.
18¿é 5:16 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
18¿é 5:17 "How happy is the one whom God reproves; therefore do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18¿é 5:18 For he wounds, but he binds up; he strikes, but his hands heal.
18¿é 5:19 He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no harm shall touch you.
18¿é 5:20 In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
18¿é 5:21 You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
18¿é 5:22 At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the wild animals of the earth.
18¿é 5:23 For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the wild animals shall be at peace with you.
18¿é 5:24 You shall know that your tent is safe, you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
18¿é 5:25 You shall know that your descendants will be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
18¿é 5:26 You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, as a shock of grain comes up to the threshing floor in its season.
18¿é 5:27 See, we have searched this out; it is true. Hear, and know it for yourself."
18¿é 6:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 6:2 "O that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!
18¿é 6:3 For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
18¿é 6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
18¿é 6:5 Does the wild ass bray over its grass, or the ox low over its fodder?
18¿é 6:6 Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any flavor in the juice of mallows?
18¿é 6:7 My appetite refuses to touch them; they are like food that is loathsome to me.
18¿é 6:8 "O that I might have my request, and that God would grant my desire;
18¿é 6:9 that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
18¿é 6:10 This would be my consolation; I would even exult in unrelenting pain; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18¿é 6:11 What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?
18¿é 6:12 Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
18¿é 6:13 In truth I have no help in me, and any resource is driven from me.
18¿é 6:14 "Those who withhold kindness from a friend forsake the fear of the Almighty.
18¿é 6:15 My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed, like freshets that pass away,
18¿é 6:16 that run dark with ice, turbid with melting snow.
18¿é 6:17 In time of heat they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
18¿é 6:18 The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste, and perish.
18¿é 6:19 The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.
18¿é 6:20 They are disappointed because they were confident; they come there and are confounded.
18¿é 6:21 Such you have now become to me; you see my calamity, and are afraid.
18¿é 6:22 Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?
18¿é 6:23 Or, 'Save me from an opponent's hand'? Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of oppressors'?
18¿é 6:24 "Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone wrong.
18¿é 6:25 How forceful are honest words! But your reproof, what does it reprove?
18¿é 6:26 Do you think that you can reprove words, as if the speech of the desperate were wind?
18¿é 6:27 You would even cast lots over the orphan, and bargain over your friend.
18¿é 6:28 "But now, be pleased to look at me; for I will not lie to your face.
18¿é 6:29 Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done. Turn now, my vindication is at stake.
18¿é 6:30 Is there any wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?
18¿é 7:1 "Do not human beings have a hard service on earth, and are not their days like the days of a laborer?
18¿é 7:2 Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like laborers who look for their wages,
18¿é 7:3 so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
18¿é 7:4 When I lie down I say, 'When shall I rise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing until dawn.
18¿é 7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out again.
18¿é 7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and come to their end without hope.
18¿é 7:7 "Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good.
18¿é 7:8 The eye that beholds me will see me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I shall be gone.
18¿é 7:9 As the cloud fades and vanishes, so those who go down to Sheol do not come up;
18¿é 7:10 they return no more to their houses, nor do their places know them any more.
18¿é 7:11 "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18¿é 7:12 Am I the Sea, or the Dragon, that you set a guard over me?
18¿é 7:13 When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'
18¿é 7:14 then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18¿é 7:15 so that I would choose strangling and death rather than this body.
18¿é 7:16 I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are a breath.
18¿é 7:17 What are human beings, that you make so much of them, that you set your mind on them,
18¿é 7:18 visit them every morning, test them every moment?
18¿é 7:19 Will you not look away from me for a while, let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
18¿é 7:20 If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of humanity? Why have you made me your target? Why have I become a burden to you?
18¿é 7:21 Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."
18¿é 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
18¿é 8:2 "How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
18¿é 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
18¿é 8:4 If your children sinned against him, he delivered them into the power of their transgression.
18¿é 8:5 If you will seek God and make supplication to the Almighty,
18¿é 8:6 if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore to you your rightful place.
18¿é 8:7 Though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.
18¿é 8:8 "For inquire now of bygone generations, and consider what their ancestors have found;
18¿é 8:9 for we are but of yesterday, and we know nothing, for our days on earth are but a shadow.
18¿é 8:10 Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?
18¿é 8:11 "Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?
18¿é 8:12 While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.
18¿é 8:13 Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.
18¿é 8:14 Their confidence is gossamer, a spider's house their trust.
18¿é 8:15 If one leans against its house, it will not stand; if one lays hold of it, it will not endure.
18¿é 8:16 The wicked thrive before the sun, and their shoots spread over the garden.
18¿é 8:17 Their roots twine around the stoneheap; they live among the rocks.
18¿é 8:18 If they are destroyed from their place, then it will deny them, saying, 'I have never seen you.'
18¿é 8:19 See, these are their happy ways, and out of the earth still others will spring.
18¿é 8:20 "See, God will not reject a blameless person, nor take the hand of evildoers.
18¿é 8:21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouts of joy.
18¿é 8:22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."
18¿é 9:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 9:2 "Indeed I know that this is so; but how can a mortal be just before God?
18¿é 9:3 If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand.
18¿é 9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength--who has resisted him, and succeeded?--
18¿é 9:5 he who removes mountains, and they do not know it, when he overturns them in his anger;
18¿é 9:6 who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
18¿é 9:7 who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;
18¿é 9:8 who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the Sea;
18¿é 9:9 who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
18¿é 9:10 who does great things beyond understanding, and marvelous things without number.
18¿é 9:11 Look, he passes by me, and I do not see him; he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
18¿é 9:12 He snatches away; who can stop him? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'
18¿é 9:13 "God will not turn back his anger; the helpers of Rahab bowed beneath him.
18¿é 9:14 How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?
18¿é 9:15 Though I am innocent, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
18¿é 9:16 If I summoned him and he answered me, I do not believe that he would listen to my voice.
18¿é 9:17 For he crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause;
18¿é 9:18 he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
18¿é 9:19 If it is a contest of strength, he is the strong one! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
18¿é 9:20 Though I am innocent, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
18¿é 9:21 I am blameless; I do not know myself; I loathe my life.
18¿é 9:22 It is all one; therefore I say, he destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
18¿é 9:23 When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.
18¿é 9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the eyes of its judges--if it is not he, who then is it?
18¿é 9:25 "My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.
18¿é 9:26 They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey.
18¿é 9:27 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint; I will put off my sad countenance and be of good cheer,'
18¿é 9:28 I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
18¿é 9:29 I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
18¿é 9:30 If I wash myself with soap and cleanse my hands with lye,
18¿é 9:31 yet you will plunge me into filth, and my own clothes will abhor me.
18¿é 9:32 For he is not a mortal, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together.
18¿é 9:33 There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand on us both.
18¿é 9:34 If he would take his rod away from me, and not let dread of him terrify me,
18¿é 9:35 then I would speak without fear of him, for I know I am not what I am thought to be.
18¿é 10:1 "I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18¿é 10:2 I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me.
18¿é 10:3 Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?
18¿é 10:4 Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as humans see?
18¿é 10:5 Are your days like the days of mortals, or your years like human years,
18¿é 10:6 that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,
18¿é 10:7 although you know that I am not guilty, and there is no one to deliver out of your hand?
18¿é 10:8 Your hands fashioned and made me; and now you turn and destroy me.
18¿é 10:9 Remember that you fashioned me like clay; and will you turn me to dust again?
18¿é 10:10 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
18¿é 10:11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
18¿é 10:12 You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.
18¿é 10:13 Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.
18¿é 10:14 If I sin, you watch me, and do not acquit me of my iniquity.
18¿é 10:15 If I am wicked, woe to me! If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look upon my affliction.
18¿é 10:16 Bold as a lion you hunt me; you repeat your exploits against me.
18¿é 10:17 You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.
18¿é 10:18 "Why did you bring me forth from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me,
18¿é 10:19 and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.
18¿é 10:20 Are not the days of my life few? Let me alone, that I may find a little comfort
18¿é 10:21 before I go, never to return, to the land of gloom and deep darkness,
18¿é 10:22 the land of gloom and chaos, where light is like darkness."
18¿é 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
18¿é 11:2 "Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and should one full of talk be vindicated?
18¿é 11:3 Should your babble put others to silence, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
18¿é 11:4 For you say, 'My conduct is pure, and I am clean in God's sight.'
18¿é 11:5 But oh, that God would speak, and open his lips to you,
18¿é 11:6 and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For wisdom is many-sided. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
18¿é 11:7 "Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
18¿é 11:8 It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know?
18¿é 11:9 Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
18¿é 11:10 If he passes through, and imprisons, and assembles for judgment, who can hinder him?
18¿é 11:11 For he knows those who are worthless; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
18¿é 11:12 But a stupid person will get understanding, when a wild ass is born human.
18¿é 11:13 "If you direct your heart rightly, you will stretch out your hands toward him.
18¿é 11:14 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and do not let wickedness reside in your tents.
18¿é 11:15 Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure, and will not fear.
18¿é 11:16 You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
18¿é 11:17 And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
18¿é 11:18 And you will have confidence, because there is hope; you will be protected and take your rest in safety.
18¿é 11:19 You will lie down, and no one will make you afraid; many will entreat your favor.
18¿é 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
18¿é 12:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 12:2 "No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you.
18¿é 12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?
18¿é 12:4 I am a laughingstock to my friends; I, who called upon God and he answered me, a just and blameless man, I am a laughingstock.
18¿é 12:5 Those at ease have contempt for misfortune, but it is ready for those whose feet are unstable.
18¿é 12:6 The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hands.
18¿é 12:7 "But ask the animals, and they will teach you; the birds of the air, and they will tell you;
18¿é 12:8 ask the plants of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you.
18¿é 12:9 Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18¿é 12:10 In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of every human being.
18¿é 12:11 Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
18¿é 12:12 Is wisdom with the aged, and understanding in length of days?
18¿é 12:13 "With God are wisdom and strength; he has counsel and understanding.
18¿é 12:14 If he tears down, no one can rebuild; if he shuts someone in, no one can open up.
18¿é 12:15 If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land.
18¿é 12:16 With him are strength and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his.
18¿é 12:17 He leads counselors away stripped, and makes fools of judges.
18¿é 12:18 He looses the sash of kings, and binds a waistcloth on their loins.
18¿é 12:19 He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.
18¿é 12:20 He deprives of speech those who are trusted, and takes away the discernment of the elders.
18¿é 12:21 He pours contempt on princes, and looses the belt of the strong.
18¿é 12:22 He uncovers the deeps out of darkness, and brings deep darkness to light.
18¿é 12:23 He makes nations great, then destroys them; he enlarges nations, then leads them away.
18¿é 12:24 He strips understanding from the leaders of the earth, and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
18¿é 12:25 They grope in the dark without light; he makes them stagger like a drunkard.
18¿é 13:1 "Look, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
18¿é 13:2 What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18¿é 13:3 But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God.
18¿é 13:4 As for you, you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless physicians.
18¿é 13:5 If you would only keep silent, that would be your wisdom!
18¿é 13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
18¿é 13:7 Will you speak falsely for God, and speak deceitfully for him?
18¿é 13:8 Will you show partiality toward him, will you plead the case for God?
18¿é 13:9 Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one person deceives another?
18¿é 13:10 He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality.
18¿é 13:11 Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you?
18¿é 13:12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes, your defenses are defenses of clay.
18¿é 13:13 "Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may.
18¿é 13:14 I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand.
18¿é 13:15 See, he will kill me; I have no hope; but I will defend my ways to his face.
18¿é 13:16 This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him.
18¿é 13:17 Listen carefully to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears.
18¿é 13:18 I have indeed prepared my case; I know that I shall be vindicated.
18¿é 13:19 Who is there that will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
18¿é 13:20 Only grant two things to me, then I will not hide myself from your face:
18¿é 13:21 withdraw your hand far from me, and do not let dread of you terrify me.
18¿é 13:22 Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me.
18¿é 13:23 How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
18¿é 13:24 Why do you hide your face, and count me as your enemy?
18¿é 13:25 Will you frighten a windblown leaf and pursue dry chaff?
18¿é 13:26 For you write bitter things against me, and make me reap the iniquities of my youth.
18¿é 13:27 You put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths; you set a bound to the soles of my feet.
18¿é 13:28 One wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
18¿é 14:1 "A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble,
18¿é 14:2 comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow and does not last.
18¿é 14:3 Do you fix your eyes on such a one? Do you bring me into judgment with you?
18¿é 14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one can.
18¿é 14:5 Since their days are determined, and the number of their months is known to you, and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,
18¿é 14:6 look away from them, and desist, that they may enjoy, like laborers, their days.
18¿é 14:7 "For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.
18¿é 14:8 Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,
18¿é 14:9 yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.
18¿é 14:10 But mortals die, and are laid low; humans expire, and where are they?
18¿é 14:11 As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,
18¿é 14:12 so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused out of their sleep.
18¿é 14:13 Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!
18¿é 14:14 If mortals die, will they live again? All the days of my service I would wait until my release should come.
18¿é 14:15 You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands.
18¿é 14:16 For then you would not number my steps, you would not keep watch over my sin;
18¿é 14:17 my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity.
18¿é 14:18 "But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place;
18¿é 14:19 the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of mortals.
18¿é 14:20 You prevail forever against them, and they pass away; you change their countenance, and send them away.
18¿é 14:21 Their children come to honor, and they do not know it; they are brought low, and it goes unnoticed.
18¿é 14:22 They feel only the pain of their own bodies, and mourn only for themselves."
18¿é 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
18¿é 15:2 "Should the wise answer with windy knowledge, and fill themselves with the east wind?
18¿é 15:3 Should they argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which they can do no good?
18¿é 15:4 But you are doing away with the fear of God, and hindering meditation before God.
18¿é 15:5 For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
18¿é 15:6 Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you.
18¿é 15:7 "Are you the firstborn of the human race? Were you brought forth before the hills?
18¿é 15:8 Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
18¿é 15:9 What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
18¿é 15:10 The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, those older than your father.
18¿é 15:11 Are the consolations of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?
18¿é 15:12 Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18¿é 15:13 so that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?
18¿é 15:14 What are mortals, that they can be clean? Or those born of woman, that they can be righteous?
18¿é 15:15 God puts no trust even in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his sight;
18¿é 15:16 how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, one who drinks iniquity like water!
18¿é 15:17 "I will show you; listen to me; what I have seen I will declare--
18¿é 15:18 what sages have told, and their ancestors have not hidden,
18¿é 15:19 to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them.
18¿é 15:20 The wicked writhe in pain all their days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.
18¿é 15:21 Terrifying sounds are in their ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon them.
18¿é 15:22 They despair of returning from darkness, and they are destined for the sword.
18¿é 15:23 They wander abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' They know that a day of darkness is ready at hand;
18¿é 15:24 distress and anguish terrify them; they prevail against them, like a king prepared for battle.
18¿é 15:25 Because they stretched out their hands against God, and bid defiance to the Almighty,
18¿é 15:26 running stubbornly against him with a thick-bossed shield;
18¿é 15:27 because they have covered their faces with their fat, and gathered fat upon their loins,
18¿é 15:28 they will live in desolate cities, in houses that no one should inhabit, houses destined to become heaps of ruins;
18¿é 15:29 they will not be rich, and their wealth will not endure, nor will they strike root in the earth;
18¿é 15:30 they will not escape from darkness; the flame will dry up their shoots, and their blossom will be swept away by the wind.
18¿é 15:31 Let them not trust in emptiness, deceiving themselves; for emptiness will be their recompense.
18¿é 15:32 It will be paid in full before their time, and their branch will not be green.
18¿é 15:33 They will shake off their unripe grape, like the vine, and cast off their blossoms, like the olive tree.
18¿é 15:34 For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery.
18¿é 15:35 They conceive mischief and bring forth evil and their heart prepares deceit."
18¿é 16:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 16:2 "I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.
18¿é 16:3 Have windy words no limit? Or what provokes you that you keep on talking?
18¿é 16:4 I also could talk as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you.
18¿é 16:5 I could encourage you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.
18¿é 16:6 "If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?
18¿é 16:7 Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.
18¿é 16:8 And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me; my leanness has risen up against me, and it testifies to my face.
18¿é 16:9 He has torn me in his wrath, and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
18¿é 16:10 They have gaped at me with their mouths; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me.
18¿é 16:11 God gives me up to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
18¿é 16:12 I was at ease, and he broke me in two; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;
18¿é 16:13 his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys, and shows no mercy; he pours out my gall on the ground.
18¿é 16:14 He bursts upon me again and again; he rushes at me like a warrior.
18¿é 16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my strength in the dust.
18¿é 16:16 My face is red with weeping, and deep darkness is on my eyelids,
18¿é 16:17 though there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
18¿é 16:18 "O earth, do not cover my blood; let my outcry find no resting place.
18¿é 16:19 Even now, in fact, my witness is in heaven, and he that vouches for me is on high.
18¿é 16:20 My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,
18¿é 16:21 that he would maintain the right of a mortal with God, as one does for a neighbor.
18¿é 16:22 For when a few years have come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
18¿é 17:1 My spirit is broken, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me.
18¿é 17:2 Surely there are mockers around me, and my eye dwells on their provocation.
18¿é 17:3 "Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there that will give surety for me?
18¿é 17:4 Since you have closed their minds to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph.
18¿é 17:5 Those who denounce friends for reward--the eyes of their children will fail.
18¿é 17:6 "He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom people spit.
18¿é 17:7 My eye has grown dim from grief, and all my members are like a shadow.
18¿é 17:8 The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stir themselves up against the godless.
18¿é 17:9 Yet the righteous hold to their way, and they that have clean hands grow stronger and stronger.
18¿é 17:10 But you, come back now, all of you, and I shall not find a sensible person among you.
18¿é 17:11 My days are past, my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart.
18¿é 17:12 They make night into day; 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.'
18¿é 17:13 If I look for Sheol as my house, if I spread my couch in darkness,
18¿é 17:14 if I say to the Pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'
18¿é 17:15 where then is my hope? Who will see my hope?
18¿é 17:16 Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"
18¿é 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
18¿é 18:2 "How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we shall speak.
18¿é 18:3 Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?
18¿é 18:4 You who tear yourself in your anger--shall the earth be forsaken because of you, or the rock be removed out of its place?
18¿é 18:5 "Surely the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of their fire does not shine.
18¿é 18:6 The light is dark in their tent, and the lamp above them is put out.
18¿é 18:7 Their strong steps are shortened, and their own schemes throw them down.
18¿é 18:8 For they are thrust into a net by their own feet, and they walk into a pitfall.
18¿é 18:9 A trap seizes them by the heel; a snare lays hold of them.
18¿é 18:10 A rope is hid for them in the ground, a trap for them in the path.
18¿é 18:11 Terrors frighten them on every side, and chase them at their heels.
18¿é 18:12 Their strength is consumed by hunger, and calamity is ready for their stumbling.
18¿é 18:13 By disease their skin is consumed, the firstborn of Death consumes their limbs.
18¿é 18:14 They are torn from the tent in which they trusted, and are brought to the king of terrors.
18¿é 18:15 In their tents nothing remains; sulfur is scattered upon their habitations.
18¿é 18:16 Their roots dry up beneath, and their branches wither above.
18¿é 18:17 Their memory perishes from the earth, and they have no name in the street.
18¿é 18:18 They are thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world.
18¿é 18:19 They have no offspring or descendant among their people, and no survivor where they used to live.
18¿é 18:20 They of the west are appalled at their fate, and horror seizes those of the east.
18¿é 18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, such is the place of those who do not know God."
18¿é 19:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 19:2 "How long will you torment me, and break me in pieces with words?
18¿é 19:3 These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?
18¿é 19:4 And even if it is true that I have erred, my error remains with me.
18¿é 19:5 If indeed you magnify yourselves against me, and make my humiliation an argument against me,
18¿é 19:6 know then that God has put me in the wrong, and closed his net around me.
18¿é 19:7 Even when I cry out, 'Violence!' I am not answered; I call aloud, but there is no justice.
18¿é 19:8 He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths.
18¿é 19:9 He has stripped my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head.
18¿é 19:10 He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, he has uprooted my hope like a tree.
18¿é 19:11 He has kindled his wrath against me, and counts me as his adversary.
18¿é 19:12 His troops come on together; they have thrown up siegeworks against me, and encamp around my tent.
18¿é 19:13 "He has put my family far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
18¿é 19:14 My relatives and my close friends have failed me;
18¿é 19:15 the guests in my house have forgotten me; my serving girls count me as a stranger; I have become an alien in their eyes.
18¿é 19:16 I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must myself plead with him.
18¿é 19:17 My breath is repulsive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family.
18¿é 19:18 Even young children despise me; when I rise, they talk against me.
18¿é 19:19 All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me.
18¿é 19:20 My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
18¿é 19:21 Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!
18¿é 19:22 Why do you, like God, pursue me, never satisfied with my flesh?
18¿é 19:23 "O that my words were written down! O that they were inscribed in a book!
18¿é 19:24 O that with an iron pen and with lead they were engraved on a rock forever!
18¿é 19:25 For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that at the last he will stand upon the earth;
18¿é 19:26 and after my skin has been thus destroyed, then in my flesh I shall see God,
18¿é 19:27 whom I shall see on my side, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!
18¿é 19:28 If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him';
18¿é 19:29 be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment."
18¿é 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
18¿é 20:2 "Pay attention! My thoughts urge me to answer, because of the agitation within me.
18¿é 20:3 I hear censure that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.
18¿é 20:4 Do you not know this from of old, ever since mortals were placed on earth,
18¿é 20:5 that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless is but for a moment?
18¿é 20:6 Even though they mount up high as the heavens, and their head reaches to the clouds,
18¿é 20:7 they will perish forever like their own dung; those who have seen them will say, 'Where are they?'
18¿é 20:8 They will fly away like a dream, and not be found; they will be chased away like a vision of the night.
18¿é 20:9 The eye that saw them will see them no more, nor will their place behold them any longer.
18¿é 20:10 Their children will seek the favor of the poor, and their hands will give back their wealth.
18¿é 20:11 Their bodies, once full of youth, will lie down in the dust with them.
18¿é 20:12 "Though wickedness is sweet in their mouth, though they hide it under their tongues,
18¿é 20:13 though they are loath to let it go, and hold it in their mouths,
18¿é 20:14 yet their food is turned in their stomachs; it is the venom of asps within them.
18¿é 20:15 They swallow down riches and vomit them up again; God casts them out of their bellies.
18¿é 20:16 They will suck the poison of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill them.
18¿é 20:17 They will not look on the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.
18¿é 20:18 They will give back the fruit of their toil, and will not swallow it down; from the profit of their trading they will get no enjoyment.
18¿é 20:19 For they have crushed and abandoned the poor, they have seized a house that they did not build.
18¿é 20:20 "They knew no quiet in their bellies; in their greed they let nothing escape.
18¿é 20:21 There was nothing left after they had eaten; therefore their prosperity will not endure.
18¿é 20:22 In full sufficiency they will be in distress; all the force of misery will come upon them.
18¿é 20:23 To fill their belly to the full God will send his fierce anger into them, and rain it upon them as their food.
18¿é 20:24 They will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike them through.
18¿é 20:25 It is drawn forth and comes out of their body, and the glittering point comes out of their gall; terrors come upon them.
18¿é 20:26 Utter darkness is laid up for their treasures; a fire fanned by no one will devour them; what is left in their tent will be consumed.
18¿é 20:27 The heavens will reveal their iniquity, and the earth will rise up against them.
18¿é 20:28 The possessions of their house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath.
18¿é 20:29 This is the portion of the wicked from God, the heritage decreed for them by God."
18¿é 21:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 21:2 "Listen carefully to my words, and let this be your consolation.
18¿é 21:3 Bear with me, and I will speak; then after I have spoken, mock on.
18¿é 21:4 As for me, is my complaint addressed to mortals? Why should I not be impatient?
18¿é 21:5 Look at me, and be appalled, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
18¿é 21:6 When I think of it I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh.
18¿é 21:7 Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?
18¿é 21:8 Their children are established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.
18¿é 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them.
18¿é 21:10 Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and never miscarries.
18¿é 21:11 They send out their little ones like a flock, and their children dance around.
18¿é 21:12 They sing to the tambourine and the lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
18¿é 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol.
18¿é 21:14 They say to God, 'Leave us alone! We do not desire to know your ways.
18¿é 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?'
18¿é 21:16 Is not their prosperity indeed their own achievement? The plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.
18¿é 21:17 "How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? How often does calamity come upon them? How often does God distribute pains in his anger?
18¿é 21:18 How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away?
18¿é 21:19 You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let it be paid back to them, so that they may know it.
18¿é 21:20 Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
18¿é 21:21 For what do they care for their household after them, when the number of their months is cut off?
18¿é 21:22 Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those that are on high?
18¿é 21:23 One dies in full prosperity, being wholly at ease and secure,
18¿é 21:24 his loins full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist.
18¿é 21:25 Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of good.
18¿é 21:26 They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them.
18¿é 21:27 "Oh, I know your thoughts, and your schemes to wrong me.
18¿é 21:28 For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'
18¿é 21:29 Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony,
18¿é 21:30 that the wicked are spared in the day of calamity, and are rescued in the day of wrath?
18¿é 21:31 Who declares their way to their face, and who repays them for what they have done?
18¿é 21:32 When they are carried to the grave, a watch is kept over their tomb.
18¿é 21:33 The clods of the valley are sweet to them; everyone will follow after, and those who went before are innumerable.
18¿é 21:34 How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood."
18¿é 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
18¿é 22:2 "Can a mortal be of use to God? Can even the wisest be of service to him?
18¿é 22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?
18¿é 22:4 Is it for your piety that he reproves you, and enters into judgment with you?
18¿é 22:5 Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.
18¿é 22:6 For you have exacted pledges from your family for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
18¿é 22:7 You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
18¿é 22:8 The powerful possess the land, and the favored live in it.
18¿é 22:9 You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the orphans you have crushed.
18¿é 22:10 Therefore snares are around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,
18¿é 22:11 or darkness so that you cannot see; a flood of water covers you.
18¿é 22:12 "Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!
18¿é 22:13 Therefore you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?
18¿é 22:14 Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the dome of heaven.'
18¿é 22:15 Will you keep to the old way that the wicked have trod?
18¿é 22:16 They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away by a flood.
18¿é 22:17 They said to God, 'Leave us alone,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'
18¿é 22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things--but the plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.
18¿é 22:19 The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent laugh them to scorn,
18¿é 22:20 saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left, the fire has consumed.'
18¿é 22:21 "Agree with God, and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.
18¿é 22:22 Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.
18¿é 22:23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored, if you remove unrighteousness from your tents,
18¿é 22:24 if you treat gold like dust, and gold of Ophir like the stones of the torrent-bed,
18¿é 22:25 and if the Almighty is your gold and your precious silver,
18¿é 22:26 then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and lift up your face to God.
18¿é 22:27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.
18¿é 22:28 You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.
18¿é 22:29 When others are humiliated, you say it is pride; for he saves the humble.
18¿é 22:30 He will deliver even those who are guilty; they will escape because of the cleanness of your hands."
18¿é 23:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 23:2 "Today also my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.
18¿é 23:3 Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his dwelling!
18¿é 23:4 I would lay my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
18¿é 23:5 I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
18¿é 23:6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.
18¿é 23:7 There an upright person could reason with him, and I should be acquitted forever by my judge.
18¿é 23:8 "If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him;
18¿é 23:9 on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him; I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.
18¿é 23:10 But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I shall come out like gold.
18¿é 23:11 My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
18¿é 23:12 I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured in my bosom the words of his mouth.
18¿é 23:13 But he stands alone and who can dissuade him? What he desires, that he does.
18¿é 23:14 For he will complete what he appoints for me; and many such things are in his mind.
18¿é 23:15 Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.
18¿é 23:16 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
18¿é 23:17 If only I could vanish in darkness, and thick darkness would cover my face!
18¿é 24:1 "Why are times not kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days?
18¿é 24:2 The wicked remove landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them.
18¿é 24:3 They drive away the donkey of the orphan; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
18¿é 24:4 They thrust the needy off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
18¿é 24:5 Like wild asses in the desert they go out to their toil, scavenging in the wasteland food for their young.
18¿é 24:6 They reap in a field not their own and they glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
18¿é 24:7 They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.
18¿é 24:8 They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and cling to the rock for want of shelter.
18¿é 24:9 "There are those who snatch the orphan child from the breast, and take as a pledge the infant of the poor.
18¿é 24:10 They go about naked, without clothing; though hungry, they carry the sheaves;
18¿é 24:11 between their terraces they press out oil; they tread the wine presses, but suffer thirst.
18¿é 24:12 From the city the dying groan, and the throat of the wounded cries for help; yet God pays no attention to their prayer.
18¿é 24:13 "There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths.
18¿é 24:14 The murderer rises at dusk to kill the poor and needy, and in the night is like a thief.
18¿é 24:15 The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he disguises his face.
18¿é 24:16 In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light.
18¿é 24:17 For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
18¿é 24:18 "Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion in the land is cursed; no treader turns toward their vineyards.
18¿é 24:19 Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
18¿é 24:20 The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered; so wickedness is broken like a tree.
18¿é 24:21 "They harm the childless woman, and do no good to the widow.
18¿é 24:22 Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life.
18¿é 24:23 He gives them security, and they are supported; his eyes are upon their ways.
18¿é 24:24 They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they wither and fade like the mallow; they are cut off like the heads of grain.
18¿é 24:25 If it is not so, who will prove me a liar, and show that there is nothing in what I say?"
18¿é 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
18¿é 25:2 "Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven.
18¿é 25:3 Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
18¿é 25:4 How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
18¿é 25:5 If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his sight,
18¿é 25:6 how much less a mortal, who is a maggot, and a human being, who is a worm!"
18¿é 26:1 Then Job answered:
18¿é 26:2 "How you have helped one who has no power! How you have assisted the arm that has no strength!
18¿é 26:3 How you have counseled one who has no wisdom, and given much good advice!
18¿é 26:4 With whose help have you uttered words, and whose spirit has come forth from you?
18¿é 26:5 The shades below tremble, the waters and their inhabitants.
18¿é 26:6 Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
18¿é 26:7 He stretches out Zaphon over the void, and hangs the earth upon nothing.
18¿é 26:8 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not torn open by them.
18¿é 26:9 He covers the face of the full moon, and spreads over it his cloud.
18¿é 26:10 He has described a circle on the face of the waters, at the boundary between light and darkness.
18¿é 26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astounded at his rebuke.
18¿é 26:12 By his power he stilled the Sea; by his understanding he struck down Rahab.
18¿é 26:13 By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
18¿é 26:14 These are indeed but the outskirts of his ways; and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18¿é 27:1 Job again took up his discourse and said:
18¿é 27:2 "As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
18¿é 27:3 as long as my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
18¿é 27:4 my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
18¿é 27:5 Far be it from me to say that you are right; until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
18¿é 27:6 I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
18¿é 27:7 "May my enemy be like the wicked, and may my opponent be like the unrighteous.
18¿é 27:8 For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts them off, when God takes away their lives?
18¿é 27:9 Will God hear their cry when trouble comes upon them?
18¿é 27:10 Will they take delight in the Almighty? Will they call upon God at all times?
18¿é 27:11 I will teach you concerning the hand of God; that which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
18¿é 27:12 All of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?
18¿é 27:13 "This is the portion of the wicked with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:
18¿é 27:14 If their children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and their offspring have not enough to eat.
18¿é 27:15 Those who survive them the pestilence buries, and their widows make no lamentation.
18¿é 27:16 Though they heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay--
18¿é 27:17 they may pile it up, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.
18¿é 27:18 They build their houses like nests, like booths made by sentinels of the vineyard.
18¿é 27:19 They go to bed with wealth, but will do so no more; they open their eyes, and it is gone.
18¿é 27:20 Terrors overtake them like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries them off.
18¿é 27:21 The east wind lifts them up and they are gone; it sweeps them out of their place.
18¿é 27:22 It hurls at them without pity; they flee from its power in headlong flight.
18¿é 27:23 It claps its hands at them, and hisses at them from its place.
18¿é 28:1 "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold to be refined.
18¿é 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
18¿é 28:3 Miners put an end to darkness, and search out to the farthest bound the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
18¿é 28:4 They open shafts in a valley away from human habitation; they are forgotten by travelers, they sway suspended, remote from people.
18¿é 28:5 As for the earth, out of it comes bread; but underneath it is turned up as by fire.
18¿é 28:6 Its stones are the place of sapphires, and its dust contains gold.
18¿é 28:7 "That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
18¿é 28:8 The proud wild animals have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.
18¿é 28:9 "They put their hand to the flinty rock, and overturn mountains by the roots.
18¿é 28:10 They cut out channels in the rocks, and their eyes see every precious thing.
18¿é 28:11 The sources of the rivers they probe; hidden things they bring to light.
18¿é 28:12 "But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
18¿é 28:13 Mortals do not know the way to it, and it is not found in the land of the living.
18¿é 28:14 The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
18¿é 28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, and silver cannot be weighed out as its price.
18¿é 28:16 It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
18¿é 28:17 Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
18¿é 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.
18¿é 28:19 The chrysolite of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
18¿é 28:20 "Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
18¿é 28:21 It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the birds of the air.
18¿é 28:22 Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'
18¿é 28:23 "God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.
18¿é 28:24 For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees everything under the heavens.
18¿é 28:25 When he gave to the wind its weight, and apportioned out the waters by measure;
18¿é 28:26 when he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the thunderbolt;
18¿é 28:27 then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.
18¿é 28:28 And he said to humankind, 'Truly, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.'"
18¿é 29:1 Job again took up his discourse and said:
18¿é 29:2 "Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;
18¿é 29:3 when his lamp shone over my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;
18¿é 29:4 when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent;
18¿é 29:5 when the Almighty was still with me, when my children were around me;
18¿é 29:6 when my steps were washed with milk, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
18¿é 29:7 When I went out to the gate of the city, when I took my seat in the square,
18¿é 29:8 the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose up and stood;
18¿é 29:9 the nobles refrained from talking, and laid their hands on their mouths;
18¿é 29:10 the voices of princes were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
18¿é 29:11 When the ear heard, it commended me, and when the eye saw, it approved;
18¿é 29:12 because I delivered the poor who cried, and the orphan who had no helper.
18¿é 29:13 The blessing of the wretched came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
18¿é 29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
18¿é 29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.
18¿é 29:16 I was a father to the needy, and I championed the cause of the stranger.
18¿é 29:17 I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made them drop their prey from their teeth.
18¿é 29:18 Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days like the phoenix;
18¿é 29:19 my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches;
18¿é 29:20 my glory was fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'
18¿é 29:21 "They listened to me, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.
18¿é 29:22 After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them like dew.
18¿é 29:23 They waited for me as for the rain; they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
18¿é 29:24 I smiled on them when they had no confidence; and the light of my countenance they did not extinguish.
18¿é 29:25 I chose their way, and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.
18¿é 30:1 "But now they make sport of me, those who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
18¿é 30:2 What could I gain from the strength of their hands? All their vigor is gone.
18¿é 30:3 Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry and desolate ground,
18¿é 30:4 they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes, and to warm themselves the roots of broom.
18¿é 30:5 They are driven out from society; people shout after them as after a thief.
18¿é 30:6 In the gullies of wadis they must live, in holes in the ground, and in the rocks.
18¿é 30:7 Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together.
18¿é 30:8 A senseless, disreputable brood, they have been whipped out of the land.
18¿é 30:9 "And now they mock me in song; I am a byword to them.
18¿é 30:10 They abhor me, they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me.
18¿é 30:11 Because God has loosed my bowstring and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
18¿é 30:12 On my right hand the rabble rise up; they send me sprawling, and build roads for my ruin.
18¿é 30:13 They break up my path, they promote my calamity; no one restrains them.
18¿é 30:14 As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on.
18¿é 30:15 Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
18¿é 30:16 "And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold of me.
18¿é 30:17 The night racks my bones, and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest.
18¿é 30:18 With violence he seizes my garment; he grasps me by the collar of my tunic.
18¿é 30:19 He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
18¿é 30:20 I cry to you and you do not answer me; I stand, and you merely look at me.
18¿é 30:21 You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me.
18¿é 30:22 You lift me up on the wind, you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm.
18¿é 30:23 I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
18¿é 30:24 "Surely one does not turn against the needy, when in disaster they cry for help.
18¿é 30:25 Did I not weep for those whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
18¿é 30:26 But when I looked for good, evil came; and when I waited for light, darkness came.
18¿é 30:27 My inward parts are in turmoil, and are never still; days of affliction come to meet me.
18¿é 30:28 I go about in sunless gloom; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
18¿é 30:29 I am a brother of jackals, and a companion of ostriches.
18¿é 30:30 My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat.
18¿é 30:31 My lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe to the voice of those who weep.
18¿é 31:1 "I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look upon a virgin?
18¿é 31:2 What would be my portion from God above, and my heritage from the Almighty on high?
18¿é 31:3 Does not calamity befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity?
18¿é 31:4 Does he not see my ways, and number all my steps?
18¿é 31:5 "If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit--
18¿é 31:6 let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!--
18¿é 31:7 if my step has turned aside from the way, and my heart has followed my eyes, and if any spot has clung to my hands;
18¿é 31:8 then let me sow, and another eat; and let what grows for me be rooted out.
18¿é 31:9 "If my heart has been enticed by a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;
18¿é 31:10 then let my wife grind for another, and let other men kneel over her.
18¿é 31:11 For that would be a heinous crime; that would be a criminal offense;
18¿é 31:12 for that would be a fire consuming down to Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my harvest.
18¿é 31:13 "If I have rejected the cause of my male or female slaves, when they brought a complaint against me;
18¿é 31:14 what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?
18¿é 31:15 Did not he who made me in the womb make them? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
18¿é 31:16 "If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
18¿é 31:17 or have eaten my morsel alone, and the orphan has not eaten from it--
18¿é 31:18 for from my youth I reared the orphan like a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow--
18¿é 31:19 if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or a poor person without covering,
18¿é 31:20 whose loins have not blessed me, and who was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
18¿é 31:21 if I have raised my hand against the orphan, because I saw I had supporters at the gate;
18¿é 31:22 then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket.
18¿é 31:23 For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty.
18¿é 31:24 "If I have made gold my trust, or called fine gold my confidence;
18¿é 31:25 if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, or because my hand had gotten much;
18¿é 31:26 if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,
18¿é 31:27 and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand;
18¿é 31:28 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I should have been false to God above.
18¿é 31:29 "If I have rejoiced at the ruin of those who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook them--
18¿é 31:30 I have not let my mouth sin by asking for their lives with a curse--
18¿é 31:31 if those of my tent ever said, 'O that we might be sated with his flesh!'--
18¿é 31:32 the stranger has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler--
18¿é 31:33 if I have concealed my transgressions as others do, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
18¿é 31:34 because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors--
18¿é 31:35 Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!
18¿é 31:36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me like a crown;
18¿é 31:37 I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him.
18¿é 31:38 "If my land has cried out against me, and its furrows have wept together;
18¿é 31:39 if I have eaten its yield without payment, and caused the death of its owners;
18¿é 31:40 let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
18¿é 32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18¿é 32:2 Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;
18¿é 32:3 he was angry also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
18¿é 32:4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.
18¿é 32:5 But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.
18¿é 32:6 Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
18¿é 32:7 I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'
18¿é 32:8 But truly it is the spirit in a mortal, the breath of the Almighty, that makes for understanding.
18¿é 32:9 It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.
18¿é 32:10 Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
18¿é 32:11 "See, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
18¿é 32:12 I gave you my attention, but there was in fact no one that confuted Job, no one among you that answered his words.
18¿é 32:13 Yet do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a human.'
18¿é 32:14 He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.
18¿é 32:15 "They are dismayed, they answer no more; they have not a word to say.
18¿é 32:16 And am I to wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
18¿é 32:17 I also will give my answer; I also will declare my opinion.
18¿é 32:18 For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
18¿é 32:19 My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
18¿é 32:20 I must speak, so that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
18¿é 32:21 I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward anyone.
18¿é 32:22 For I do not know how to flatter--or my Maker would soon put an end to me!
18¿é 33:1 "But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.
18¿é 33:2 See, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.
18¿é 33:3 My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.
18¿é 33:4 The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18¿é 33:5 Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.
18¿é 33:6 See, before God I am as you are; I too was formed from a piece of clay.
18¿é 33:7 No fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy on you.
18¿é 33:8 "Surely, you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the sound of your words.
18¿é 33:9 You say, 'I am clean, without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.
18¿é 33:10 Look, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy;
18¿é 33:11 he puts my feet in the stocks, and watches all my paths.'
18¿é 33:12 "But in this you are not right. I will answer you: God is greater than any mortal.
18¿é 33:13 Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of my words'?
18¿é 33:14 For God speaks in one way, and in two, though people do not perceive it.
18¿é 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on mortals, while they slumber on their beds,
18¿é 33:16 then he opens their ears, and terrifies them with warnings,
18¿é 33:17 that he may turn them aside from their deeds, and keep them from pride,
18¿é 33:18 to spare their souls from the Pit, their lives from traversing the River.
18¿é 33:19 They are also chastened with pain upon their beds, and with continual strife in their bones,
18¿é 33:20 so that their lives loathe bread, and their appetites dainty food.
18¿é 33:21 Their flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen; and their bones, once invisible, now stick out.
18¿é 33:22 Their souls draw near the Pit, and their lives to those who bring death.
18¿é 33:23 Then, if there should be for one of them an angel, a mediator, one of a thousand, one who declares a person upright,
18¿é 33:24 and he is gracious to that person, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the Pit; I have found a ransom;
18¿é 33:25 let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.'
18¿é 33:26 Then he prays to God, and is accepted by him, he comes into his presence with joy, and God repays him for his righteousness.
18¿é 33:27 That person sings to others and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, and it was not paid back to me.
18¿é 33:28 He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.'
18¿é 33:29 "God indeed does all these things, twice, three times, with mortals,
18¿é 33:30 to bring back their souls from the Pit, so that they may see the light of life.
18¿é 33:31 Pay heed, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
18¿é 33:32 If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.
18¿é 33:33 If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
18¿é 34:1 Then Elihu continued and said:
18¿é 34:2 "Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;
18¿é 34:3 for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
18¿é 34:4 Let us choose what is right; let us determine among ourselves what is good.
18¿é 34:5 For Job has said, 'I am innocent, and God has taken away my right;
18¿é 34:6 in spite of being right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
18¿é 34:7 Who is there like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,
18¿é 34:8 who goes in company with evildoers and walks with the wicked?
18¿é 34:9 For he has said, 'It profits one nothing to take delight in God.'
18¿é 34:10 "Therefore, hear me, you who have sense, far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
18¿é 34:11 For according to their deeds he will repay them, and according to their ways he will make it befall them.
18¿é 34:12 Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
18¿é 34:13 Who gave him charge over the earth and who laid on him the whole world?
18¿é 34:14 If he should take back his spirit to himself, and gather to himself his breath,
18¿é 34:15 all flesh would perish together, and all mortals return to dust.
18¿é 34:16 "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
18¿é 34:17 Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn one who is righteous and mighty,
18¿é 34:18 who says to a king, 'You scoundrel!' and to princes, 'You wicked men!';
18¿é 34:19 who shows no partiality to nobles, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
18¿é 34:20 In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
18¿é 34:21 "For his eyes are upon the ways of mortals, and he sees all their steps.
18¿é 34:22 There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
18¿é 34:23 For he has not appointed a time for anyone to go before God in judgment.
18¿é 34:24 He shatters the mighty without investigation, and sets others in their place.
18¿é 34:25 Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
18¿é 34:26 He strikes them for their wickedness while others look on,
18¿é 34:27 because they turned aside from following him, and had no regard for any of his ways,
18¿é 34:28 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted--
18¿é 34:29 When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or an individual?--
18¿é 34:30 so that the godless should not reign, or those who ensnare the people.
18¿é 34:31 "For has anyone said to God, 'I have endured punishment; I will not offend any more;
18¿é 34:32 teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
18¿é 34:33 Will he then pay back to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know.
18¿é 34:34 Those who have sense will say to me, and the wise who hear me will say,
18¿é 34:35 'Job speaks without knowledge, his words are without insight.'
18¿é 34:36 Would that Job were tried to the limit, because his answers are those of the wicked.
18¿é 34:37 For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."
18¿é 35:1 Elihu continued and said:
18¿é 35:2 "Do you think this to be just? You say, 'I am in the right before God.'
18¿é 35:3 If you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'
18¿é 35:4 I will answer you and your friends with you.
18¿é 35:5 Look at the heavens and see; observe the clouds, which are higher than you.
18¿é 35:6 If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
18¿é 35:7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him; or what does he receive from your hand?
18¿é 35:8 Your wickedness affects others like you, and your righteousness, other human beings.
18¿é 35:9 "Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
18¿é 35:10 But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives strength in the night,
18¿é 35:11 who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'
18¿é 35:12 There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evildoers.
18¿é 35:13 Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.
18¿é 35:14 How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
18¿é 35:15 And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not greatly heed transgression,
18¿é 35:16 Job opens his mouth in empty talk, he multiplies words without knowledge."
18¿é 36:1 Elihu continued and said:
18¿é 36:2 "Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.
18¿é 36:3 I will bring my knowledge from far away, and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
18¿é 36:4 For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
18¿é 36:5 "Surely God is mighty and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.
18¿é 36:6 He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.
18¿é 36:7 He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
18¿é 36:8 And if they are bound in fetters and caught in the cords of affliction,
18¿é 36:9 then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
18¿é 36:10 He opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.
18¿é 36:11 If they listen, and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.
18¿é 36:12 But if they do not listen, they shall perish by the sword, and die without knowledge.
18¿é 36:13 "The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them.
18¿é 36:14 They die in their youth, and their life ends in shame.
18¿é 36:15 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear by adversity.
18¿é 36:16 He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no constraint, and what was set on your table was full of fatness.
18¿é 36:17 "But you are obsessed with the case of the wicked; judgment and justice seize you.
18¿é 36:18 Beware that wrath does not entice you into scoffing, and do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
18¿é 36:19 Will your cry avail to keep you from distress, or will all the force of your strength?
18¿é 36:20 Do not long for the night, when peoples are cut off in their place.
18¿é 36:21 Beware! Do not turn to iniquity; because of that you have been tried by affliction.
18¿é 36:22 See, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?
18¿é 36:23 Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?
18¿é 36:24 "Remember to extol his work, of which mortals have sung.
18¿é 36:25 All people have looked on it; everyone watches it from far away.
18¿é 36:26 Surely God is great, and we do not know him; the number of his years is unsearchable.
18¿é 36:27 For he draws up the drops of water; he distills his mist in rain,
18¿é 36:28 which the skies pour down and drop upon mortals abundantly.
18¿é 36:29 Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?
18¿é 36:30 See, he scatters his lightning around him and covers the roots of the sea.
18¿é 36:31 For by these he governs peoples; he gives food in abundance.
18¿é 36:32 He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.
18¿é 36:33 Its crashing tells about him; he is jealous with anger against iniquity.
18¿é 37:1 "At this also my heart trembles, and leaps out of its place.
18¿é 37:2 Listen, listen to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
18¿é 37:3 Under the whole heaven he lets it loose, and his lightning to the corners of the earth.
18¿é 37:4 After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard.
18¿é 37:5 God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend.
18¿é 37:6 For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth'; and the shower of rain, his heavy shower of rain,
18¿é 37:7 serves as a sign on everyone's hand, so that all whom he has made may know it.
18¿é 37:8 Then the animals go into their lairs and remain in their dens.
18¿é 37:9 From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds.
18¿é 37:10 By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast.
18¿é 37:11 He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning.
18¿é 37:12 They turn round and round by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world.
18¿é 37:13 Whether for correction, or for his land, or for love, he causes it to happen.
18¿é 37:14 "Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God.
18¿é 37:15 Do you know how God lays his command upon them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
18¿é 37:16 Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of the one whose knowledge is perfect,
18¿é 37:17 you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?
18¿é 37:18 Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a molten mirror?
18¿é 37:19 Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.
18¿é 37:20 Should he be told that I want to speak? Did anyone ever wish to be swallowed up?
18¿é 37:21 Now, no one can look on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them.
18¿é 37:22 Out of the north comes golden splendor; around God is awesome majesty.
18¿é 37:23 The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power and justice, and abundant righteousness he will not violate.
18¿é 37:24 Therefore mortals fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."
18¿é 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:
18¿é 38:2 "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
18¿é 38:3 Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.
18¿é 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.
18¿é 38:5 Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
18¿é 38:6 On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone
18¿é 38:7 when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?
18¿é 38:8 "Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb?--
18¿é 38:9 when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band,
18¿é 38:10 and prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors,
18¿é 38:11 and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stopped'?
18¿é 38:12 "Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
18¿é 38:13 so that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
18¿é 38:14 It is changed like clay under the seal, and it is dyed like a garment.
18¿é 38:15 Light is withheld from the wicked, and their uplifted arm is broken.
18¿é 38:16 "Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18¿é 38:17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
18¿é 38:18 Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.
18¿é 38:19 "Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,
18¿é 38:20 that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?
18¿é 38:21 Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
18¿é 38:22 "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
18¿é 38:23 which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
18¿é 38:24 What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?
18¿é 38:25 "Who has cut a channel for the torrents of rain, and a way for the thunderbolt,
18¿é 38:26 to bring rain on a land where no one lives, on the desert, which is empty of human life,
18¿é 38:27 to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground put forth grass?
18¿é 38:28 "Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?
18¿é 38:29 From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the hoarfrost of heaven?
18¿é 38:30 The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
18¿é 38:31 "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loose the cords of Orion?
18¿é 38:32 Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?
18¿é 38:33 Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?
18¿é 38:34 "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that a flood of waters may cover you?
18¿é 38:35 Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?
18¿é 38:36 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?
18¿é 38:37 Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,
18¿é 38:38 when the dust runs into a mass and the clods cling together?
18¿é 38:39 "Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
18¿é 38:40 when they crouch in their dens, or lie in wait in their covert?
18¿é 38:41 Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?
18¿é 39:1 "Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer?
18¿é 39:2 Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,
18¿é 39:3 when they crouch to give birth to their offspring, and are delivered of their young?
18¿é 39:4 Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open; they go forth, and do not return to them.
18¿é 39:5 "Who has let the wild ass go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
18¿é 39:6 to which I have given the steppe for its home, the salt land for its dwelling place?
18¿é 39:7 It scorns the tumult of the city; it does not hear the shouts of the driver.
18¿é 39:8 It ranges the mountains as its pasture, and it searches after every green thing.
18¿é 39:9 "Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will it spend the night at your crib?
18¿é 39:10 Can you tie it in the furrow with ropes, or will it harrow the valleys after you?
18¿é 39:11 Will you depend on it because its strength is great, and will you hand over your labor to it?
18¿é 39:12 Do you have faith in it that it will return, and bring your grain to your threshing floor?
18¿é 39:13 "The ostrich's wings flap wildly, though its pinions lack plumage.
18¿é 39:14 For it leaves its eggs to the earth, and lets them be warmed on the ground,
18¿é 39:15 forgetting that a foot may crush them, and that a wild animal may trample them.
18¿é 39:16 It deals cruelly with its young, as if they were not its own; though its labor should be in vain, yet it has no fear;
18¿é 39:17 because God has made it forget wisdom, and given it no share in understanding.
18¿é 39:18 When it spreads its plumes aloft, it laughs at the horse and its rider.
18¿é 39:19 "Do you give the horse its might? Do you clothe its neck with mane?
18¿é 39:20 Do you make it leap like the locust? Its majestic snorting is terrible.
18¿é 39:21 It paws violently, exults mightily; it goes out to meet the weapons.
18¿é 39:22 It laughs at fear, and is not dismayed; it does not turn back from the sword.
18¿é 39:23 Upon it rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin.
18¿é 39:24 With fierceness and rage it swallows the ground; it cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
18¿é 39:25 When the trumpet sounds, it says 'Aha!' From a distance it smells the battle, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
18¿é 39:26 "Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and spreads its wings toward the south?
18¿é 39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes its nest on high?
18¿é 39:28 It lives on the rock and makes its home in the fastness of the rocky crag.
18¿é 39:29 From there it spies the prey; its eyes see it from far away.
18¿é 39:30 Its young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there it is."
18¿é 40:1 And the LORD said to Job:
18¿é 40:2 "Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Anyone who argues with God must respond."
18¿é 40:3 Then Job answered the LORD:
18¿é 40:4 "See, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.
18¿é 40:5 I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but will proceed no further."
18¿é 40:6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:
18¿é 40:7 "Gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you declare to me.
18¿é 40:8 Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?
18¿é 40:9 Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?
18¿é 40:10 "Deck yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor.
18¿é 40:11 Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on all who are proud, and abase them.
18¿é 40:12 Look on all who are proud, and bring them low; tread down the wicked where they stand.
18¿é 40:13 Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below.
18¿é 40:14 Then I will also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can give you victory.
18¿é 40:15 "Look at Behemoth, which I made just as I made you; it eats grass like an ox.
18¿é 40:16 Its strength is in its loins, and its power in the muscles of its belly.
18¿é 40:17 It makes its tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are knit together.
18¿é 40:18 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron.
18¿é 40:19 "It is the first of the great acts of God--only its Maker can approach it with the sword.
18¿é 40:20 For the mountains yield food for it where all the wild animals play.
18¿é 40:21 Under the lotus plants it lies, in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh.
18¿é 40:22 The lotus trees cover it for shade; the willows of the wadi surround it.
18¿é 40:23 Even if the river is turbulent, it is not frightened; it is confident though Jordan rushes against its mouth.
18¿é 40:24 Can one take it with hooks or pierce its nose with a snare?
18¿é 41:1 "Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down its tongue with a cord?
18¿é 41:2 Can you put a rope in its nose, or pierce its jaw with a hook?
18¿é 41:3 Will it make many supplications to you? Will it speak soft words to you?
18¿é 41:4 Will it make a covenant with you to be taken as your servant forever?
18¿é 41:5 Will you play with it as with a bird, or will you put it on leash for your girls?
18¿é 41:6 Will traders bargain over it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?
18¿é 41:7 Can you fill its skin with harpoons, or its head with fishing spears?
18¿é 41:8 Lay hands on it; think of the battle; you will not do it again!
18¿é 41:9 Any hope of capturing it will be disappointed; were not even the gods overwhelmed at the sight of it?
18¿é 41:10 No one is so fierce as to dare to stir it up. Who can stand before it?
18¿é 41:11 Who can confront it and be safe? --under the whole heaven, who?
18¿é 41:12 "I will not keep silence concerning its limbs, or its mighty strength, or its splendid frame.
18¿é 41:13 Who can strip off its outer garment? Who can penetrate its double coat of mail?
18¿é 41:14 Who can open the doors of its face? There is terror all around its teeth.
18¿é 41:15 Its back is made of shields in rows, shut up closely as with a seal.
18¿é 41:16 One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
18¿é 41:17 They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
18¿é 41:18 Its sneezes flash forth light, and its eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
18¿é 41:19 From its mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap out.
18¿é 41:20 Out of its nostrils comes smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
18¿é 41:21 Its breath kindles coals, and a flame comes out of its mouth.
18¿é 41:22 In its neck abides strength, and terror dances before it.
18¿é 41:23 The folds of its flesh cling together; it is firmly cast and immovable.
18¿é 41:24 Its heart is as hard as stone, as hard as the lower millstone.
18¿é 41:25 When it raises itself up the gods are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.
18¿é 41:26 Though the sword reaches it, it does not avail, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
18¿é 41:27 It counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
18¿é 41:28 The arrow cannot make it flee; slingstones, for it, are turned to chaff.
18¿é 41:29 Clubs are counted as chaff; it laughs at the rattle of javelins.
18¿é 41:30 Its underparts are like sharp potsherds; it spreads itself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
18¿é 41:31 It makes the deep boil like a pot; it makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
18¿é 41:32 It leaves a shining wake behind it; one would think the deep to be white-haired.
18¿é 41:33 On earth it has no equal, a creature without fear.
18¿é 41:34 It surveys everything that is lofty; it is king over all that are proud."
18¿é 42:1 Then Job answered the LORD:
18¿é 42:2 "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
18¿é 42:3 'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
18¿é 42:4 'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to me.'
18¿é 42:5 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;
18¿é 42:6 therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
18¿é 42:7 After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
18¿é 42:8 Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done."
18¿é 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
18¿é 42:10 And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
18¿é 42:11 Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.
18¿é 42:12 The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys.
18¿é 42:13 He also had seven sons and three daughters.
18¿é 42:14 He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.
18¿é 42:15 In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.
18¿é 42:16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children's children, four generations.
18¿é 42:17 And Job died, old and full of days.

19½Ã 1:1 Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or take the path that sinners tread, or sit in the seat of scoffers;
19½Ã 1:2 but their delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law they meditate day and night.
19½Ã 1:3 They are like trees planted by streams of water, which yield their fruit in its season, and their leaves do not wither. In all that they do, they prosper.
19½Ã 1:4 The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
19½Ã 1:5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
19½Ã 1:6 for the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
19½Ã 2:1 Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain?
19½Ã 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his anointed, saying,
19½Ã 2:3 "Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us."
19½Ã 2:4 He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision.
19½Ã 2:5 Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
19½Ã 2:6 "I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill."
19½Ã 2:7 I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my son; today I have begotten you.
19½Ã 2:8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
19½Ã 2:9 You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
19½Ã 2:10 Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
19½Ã 2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, with trembling
19½Ã 2:12 kiss his feet, or he will be angry, and you will perish in the way; for his wrath is quickly kindled. Happy are all who take refuge in him.
19½Ã 3:1 A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom. O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
19½Ã 3:2 many are saying to me, "There is no help for you in God." Selah
19½Ã 3:3 But you, O LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
19½Ã 3:4 I cry aloud to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah
19½Ã 3:5 I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.
19½Ã 3:6 I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
19½Ã 3:7 Rise up, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
19½Ã 3:8 Deliverance belongs to the LORD; may your blessing be on your people! Selah
19½Ã 4:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my right! You gave me room when I was in distress. Be gracious to me, and hear my prayer.
19½Ã 4:2 How long, you people, shall my honor suffer shame? How long will you love vain words, and seek after lies? Selah
19½Ã 4:3 But know that the LORD has set apart the faithful for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him.
19½Ã 4:4 When you are disturbed, do not sin; ponder it on your beds, and be silent. Selah
19½Ã 4:5 Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 4:6 There are many who say, "O that we might see some good! Let the light of your face shine on us, O LORD!"
19½Ã 4:7 You have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and wine abound.
19½Ã 4:8 I will both lie down and sleep in peace; for you alone, O LORD, make me lie down in safety.
19½Ã 5:1 To the leader: for the flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; give heed to my sighing.
19½Ã 5:2 Listen to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
19½Ã 5:3 O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I plead my case to you, and watch.
19½Ã 5:4 For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil will not sojourn with you.
19½Ã 5:5 The boastful will not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.
19½Ã 5:6 You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful.
19½Ã 5:7 But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house, I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.
19½Ã 5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
19½Ã 5:9 For there is no truth in their mouths; their hearts are destruction; their throats are open graves; they flatter with their tongues.
19½Ã 5:10 Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
19½Ã 5:11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, so that those who love your name may exult in you.
19½Ã 5:12 For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover them with favor as with a shield.
19½Ã 6:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments; according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.
19½Ã 6:2 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are shaking with terror.
19½Ã 6:3 My soul also is struck with terror, while you, O LORD--how long?
19½Ã 6:4 Turn, O LORD, save my life; deliver me for the sake of your steadfast love.
19½Ã 6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who can give you praise?
19½Ã 6:6 I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.
19½Ã 6:7 My eyes waste away because of grief; they grow weak because of all my foes.
19½Ã 6:8 Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
19½Ã 6:9 The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD accepts my prayer.
19½Ã 6:10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and struck with terror; they shall turn back, and in a moment be put to shame.
19½Ã 7:1 A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in you I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me,
19½Ã 7:2 or like a lion they will tear me apart; they will drag me away, with no one to rescue.
19½Ã 7:3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
19½Ã 7:4 if I have repaid my ally with harm or plundered my foe without cause,
19½Ã 7:5 then let the enemy pursue and overtake me, trample my life to the ground, and lay my soul in the dust. Selah
19½Ã 7:6 Rise up, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake, O my God; you have appointed a judgment.
19½Ã 7:7 Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered around you, and over it take your seat on high.
19½Ã 7:8 The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.
19½Ã 7:9 O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous, you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God.
19½Ã 7:10 God is my shield, who saves the upright in heart.
19½Ã 7:11 God is a righteous judge, and a God who has indignation every day.
19½Ã 7:12 If one does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow;
19½Ã 7:13 he has prepared his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.
19½Ã 7:14 See how they conceive evil, and are pregnant with mischief, and bring forth lies.
19½Ã 7:15 They make a pit, digging it out, and fall into the hole that they have made.
19½Ã 7:16 Their mischief returns upon their own heads, and on their own heads their violence descends.
19½Ã 7:17 I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
19½Ã 8:1 To the leader: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Sovereign, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.
19½Ã 8:2 Out of the mouths of babes and infants you have founded a bulwark because of your foes, to silence the enemy and the avenger.
19½Ã 8:3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established;
19½Ã 8:4 what are human beings that you are mindful of them, mortals that you care for them?
19½Ã 8:5 Yet you have made them a little lower than God, and crowned them with glory and honor.
19½Ã 8:6 You have given them dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under their feet,
19½Ã 8:7 all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,
19½Ã 8:8 the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
19½Ã 8:9 O LORD, our Sovereign, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
19½Ã 9:1 To the leader: according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
19½Ã 9:2 I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
19½Ã 9:3 When my enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished before you.
19½Ã 9:4 For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne giving righteous judgment.
19½Ã 9:5 You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.
19½Ã 9:6 The enemies have vanished in everlasting ruins; their cities you have rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.
19½Ã 9:7 But the LORD sits enthroned forever, he has established his throne for judgment.
19½Ã 9:8 He judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with equity.
19½Ã 9:9 The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
19½Ã 9:10 And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.
19½Ã 9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion. Declare his deeds among the peoples.
19½Ã 9:12 For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
19½Ã 9:13 Be gracious to me, O LORD. See what I suffer from those who hate me; you are the one who lifts me up from the gates of death,
19½Ã 9:14 so that I may recount all your praises, and, in the gates of daughter Zion, rejoice in your deliverance.
19½Ã 9:15 The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid has their own foot been caught.
19½Ã 9:16 The LORD has made himself known, he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah
19½Ã 9:17 The wicked shall depart to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
19½Ã 9:18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.
19½Ã 9:19 Rise up, O LORD! Do not let mortals prevail; let the nations be judged before you.
19½Ã 9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD; let the nations know that they are only human. Selah
19½Ã 10:1 Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
19½Ã 10:2 In arrogance the wicked persecute the poor--let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
19½Ã 10:3 For the wicked boast of the desires of their heart, those greedy for gain curse and renounce the LORD.
19½Ã 10:4 In the pride of their countenance the wicked say, "God will not seek it out"; all their thoughts are, "There is no God."
19½Ã 10:5 Their ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of their sight; as for their foes, they scoff at them.
19½Ã 10:6 They think in their heart, "We shall not be moved; throughout all generations we shall not meet adversity."
19½Ã 10:7 Their mouths are filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under their tongues are mischief and iniquity.
19½Ã 10:8 They sit in ambush in the villages; in hiding places they murder the innocent. Their eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;
19½Ã 10:9 they lurk in secret like a lion in its covert; they lurk that they may seize the poor; they seize the poor and drag them off in their net.
19½Ã 10:10 They stoop, they crouch, and the helpless fall by their might.
19½Ã 10:11 They think in their heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it."
19½Ã 10:12 Rise up, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the oppressed.
19½Ã 10:13 Why do the wicked renounce God, and say in their hearts, "You will not call us to account"?
19½Ã 10:14 But you do see! Indeed you note trouble and grief, that you may take it into your hands; the helpless commit themselves to you; you have been the helper of the orphan.
19½Ã 10:15 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoers; seek out their wickedness until you find none.
19½Ã 10:16 The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations shall perish from his land.
19½Ã 10:17 O LORD, you will hear the desire of the meek; you will strengthen their heart, you will incline your ear
19½Ã 10:18 to do justice for the orphan and the oppressed, so that those from earth may strike terror no more.
19½Ã 11:1 To the leader. Of David. In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to the mountains;
19½Ã 11:2 for look, the wicked bend the bow, they have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.
19½Ã 11:3 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"
19½Ã 11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold, his gaze examines humankind.
19½Ã 11:5 The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, and his soul hates the lover of violence.
19½Ã 11:6 On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and sulfur; a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
19½Ã 11:7 For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
19½Ã 12:1 To the leader: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, O LORD, for there is no longer anyone who is godly; the faithful have disappeared from humankind.
19½Ã 12:2 They utter lies to each other; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
19½Ã 12:3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
19½Ã 12:4 those who say, "With our tongues we will prevail; our lips are our own--who is our master?"
19½Ã 12:5 "Because the poor are despoiled, because the needy groan, I will now rise up," says the LORD; "I will place them in the safety for which they long."
19½Ã 12:6 The promises of the LORD are promises that are pure, silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.
19½Ã 12:7 You, O LORD, will protect us; you will guard us from this generation forever.
19½Ã 12:8 On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among humankind.
19½Ã 13:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
19½Ã 13:2 How long must I bear pain in my soul, and have sorrow in my heart all day long? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
19½Ã 13:3 Consider and answer me, O LORD my God! Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,
19½Ã 13:4 and my enemy will say, "I have prevailed"; my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.
19½Ã 13:5 But I trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
19½Ã 13:6 I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
19½Ã 14:1 To the leader. Of David. Fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds; there is no one who does good.
19½Ã 14:2 The LORD looks down from heaven on humankind to see if there are any who are wise, who seek after God.
19½Ã 14:3 They have all gone astray, they are all alike perverse; there is no one who does good, no, not one.
19½Ã 14:4 Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon the LORD?
19½Ã 14:5 There they shall be in great terror, for God is with the company of the righteous.
19½Ã 14:6 You would confound the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.
19½Ã 14:7 O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
19½Ã 15:1 A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy hill?
19½Ã 15:2 Those who walk blamelessly, and do what is right, and speak the truth from their heart;
19½Ã 15:3 who do not slander with their tongue, and do no evil to their friends, nor take up a reproach against their neighbors;
19½Ã 15:4 in whose eyes the wicked are despised, but who honor those who fear the LORD; who stand by their oath even to their hurt;
19½Ã 15:5 who do not lend money at interest, and do not take a bribe against the innocent. Those who do these things shall never be moved.
19½Ã 16:1 A Miktam of David. Protect me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
19½Ã 16:2 I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you."
19½Ã 16:3 As for the holy ones in the land, they are the noble, in whom is all my delight.
19½Ã 16:4 Those who choose another god multiply their sorrows; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names upon my lips.
19½Ã 16:5 The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
19½Ã 16:6 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; I have a goodly heritage.
19½Ã 16:7 I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
19½Ã 16:8 I keep the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
19½Ã 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices; my body also rests secure.
19½Ã 16:10 For you do not give me up to Sheol, or let your faithful one see the Pit.
19½Ã 16:11 You show me the path of life. In your presence there is fullness of joy; in your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
19½Ã 17:1 A Prayer of David. Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.
19½Ã 17:2 From you let my vindication come; let your eyes see the right.
19½Ã 17:3 If you try my heart, if you visit me by night, if you test me, you will find no wickedness in me; my mouth does not transgress.
19½Ã 17:4 As for what others do, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
19½Ã 17:5 My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.
19½Ã 17:6 I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me, hear my words.
19½Ã 17:7 Wondrously show your steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.
19½Ã 17:8 Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,
19½Ã 17:9 from the wicked who despoil me, my deadly enemies who surround me.
19½Ã 17:10 They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
19½Ã 17:11 They track me down; now they surround me; they set their eyes to cast me to the ground.
19½Ã 17:12 They are like a lion eager to tear, like a young lion lurking in ambush.
19½Ã 17:13 Rise up, O LORD, confront them, overthrow them! By your sword deliver my life from the wicked,
19½Ã 17:14 from mortals--by your hand, O LORD--from mortals whose portion in life is in this world. May their bellies be filled with what you have stored up for them; may their children have more than enough; may they leave something over to their little ones.
19½Ã 17:15 As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake I shall be satisfied, beholding your likeness.
19½Ã 18:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said: I love you, O LORD, my strength.
19½Ã 18:2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
19½Ã 18:3 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, so I shall be saved from my enemies.
19½Ã 18:4 The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of perdition assailed me;
19½Ã 18:5 the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
19½Ã 18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.
19½Ã 18:7 Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
19½Ã 18:8 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
19½Ã 18:9 He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
19½Ã 18:10 He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
19½Ã 18:11 He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.
19½Ã 18:12 Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.
19½Ã 18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice.
19½Ã 18:14 And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.
19½Ã 18:15 Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
19½Ã 18:16 He reached down from on high, he took me; he drew me out of mighty waters.
19½Ã 18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
19½Ã 18:18 They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my support.
19½Ã 18:19 He brought me out into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
19½Ã 18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
19½Ã 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
19½Ã 18:22 For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
19½Ã 18:23 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
19½Ã 18:24 Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
19½Ã 18:25 With the loyal you show yourself loyal; with the blameless you show yourself blameless;
19½Ã 18:26 with the pure you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you show yourself perverse.
19½Ã 18:27 For you deliver a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.
19½Ã 18:28 It is you who light my lamp; the LORD, my God, lights up my darkness.
19½Ã 18:29 By you I can crush a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
19½Ã 18:30 This God--his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
19½Ã 18:31 For who is God except the LORD? And who is a rock besides our God?--
19½Ã 18:32 the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.
19½Ã 18:33 He made my feet like the feet of a deer, and set me secure on the heights.
19½Ã 18:34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19½Ã 18:35 You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand has supported me; your help has made me great.
19½Ã 18:36 You gave me a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
19½Ã 18:37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back until they were consumed.
19½Ã 18:38 I struck them down, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
19½Ã 18:39 For you girded me with strength for the battle; you made my assailants sink under me.
19½Ã 18:40 You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
19½Ã 18:41 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
19½Ã 18:42 I beat them fine, like dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
19½Ã 18:43 You delivered me from strife with the peoples; You made me head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
19½Ã 18:44 As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.
19½Ã 18:45 Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their strongholds.
19½Ã 18:46 The LORD lives! Blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,
19½Ã 18:47 the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;
19½Ã 18:48 who delivered me from my enemies; indeed, you exalted me above my adversaries; you delivered me from the violent.
19½Ã 18:49 For this I will extol you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.
19½Ã 18:50 Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
19½Ã 19:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
19½Ã 19:2 Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.
19½Ã 19:3 There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;
19½Ã 19:4 yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In the heavens he has set a tent for the sun,
19½Ã 19:5 which comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.
19½Ã 19:6 Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and nothing is hid from its heat.
19½Ã 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the decrees of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple;
19½Ã 19:8 the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is clear, enlightening the eyes;
19½Ã 19:9 the fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
19½Ã 19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and drippings of the honeycomb.
19½Ã 19:11 Moreover by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
19½Ã 19:12 But who can detect their errors? Clear me from hidden faults.
19½Ã 19:13 Keep back your servant also from the insolent; do not let them have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.
19½Ã 19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
19½Ã 20:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. The LORD answer you in the day of trouble! The name of the God of Jacob protect you!
19½Ã 20:2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, and give you support from Zion.
19½Ã 20:3 May he remember all your offerings, and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. Selah
19½Ã 20:4 May he grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill all your plans.
19½Ã 20:5 May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
19½Ã 20:6 Now I know that the LORD will help his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with mighty victories by his right hand.
19½Ã 20:7 Some take pride in chariots, and some in horses, but our pride is in the name of the LORD our God.
19½Ã 20:8 They will collapse and fall, but we shall rise and stand upright.
19½Ã 20:9 Give victory to the king, O LORD; answer us when we call.
19½Ã 21:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. In your strength the king rejoices, O LORD, and in your help how greatly he exults!
19½Ã 21:2 You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
19½Ã 21:3 For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold on his head.
19½Ã 21:4 He asked you for life; you gave it to him--length of days forever and ever.
19½Ã 21:5 His glory is great through your help; splendor and majesty you bestow on him.
19½Ã 21:6 You bestow on him blessings forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
19½Ã 21:7 For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.
19½Ã 21:8 Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you.
19½Ã 21:9 You will make them like a fiery furnace when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them.
19½Ã 21:10 You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their children from among humankind.
19½Ã 21:11 If they plan evil against you, if they devise mischief, they will not succeed.
19½Ã 21:12 For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows.
19½Ã 21:13 Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.
19½Ã 22:1 To the leader: according to The Deer of the Dawn. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?
19½Ã 22:2 O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.
19½Ã 22:3 Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
19½Ã 22:4 In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.
19½Ã 22:5 To you they cried, and were saved; in you they trusted, and were not put to shame.
19½Ã 22:6 But I am a worm, and not human; scorned by others, and despised by the people.
19½Ã 22:7 All who see me mock at me; they make mouths at me, they shake their heads;
19½Ã 22:8 "Commit your cause to the LORD; let him deliver--let him rescue the one in whom he delights!"
19½Ã 22:9 Yet it was you who took me from the womb; you kept me safe on my mother's breast.
19½Ã 22:10 On you I was cast from my birth, and since my mother bore me you have been my God.
19½Ã 22:11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
19½Ã 22:12 Many bulls encircle me, strong bulls of Bashan surround me;
19½Ã 22:13 they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.
19½Ã 22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;
19½Ã 22:15 my mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.
19½Ã 22:16 For dogs are all around me; a company of evildoers encircles me. My hands and feet have shriveled;
19½Ã 22:17 I can count all my bones. They stare and gloat over me;
19½Ã 22:18 they divide my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.
19½Ã 22:19 But you, O LORD, do not be far away! O my help, come quickly to my aid!
19½Ã 22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!
19½Ã 22:21 Save me from the mouth of the lion! From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me.
19½Ã 22:22 I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:
19½Ã 22:23 You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him; stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!
19½Ã 22:24 For he did not despise or abhor the affliction of the afflicted; he did not hide his face from me, but heard when I cried to him.
19½Ã 22:25 From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
19½Ã 22:26 The poor shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD. May your hearts live forever!
19½Ã 22:27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.
19½Ã 22:28 For dominion belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.
19½Ã 22:29 To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, and I shall live for him.
19½Ã 22:30 Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord,
19½Ã 22:31 and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, saying that he has done it.
19½Ã 23:1 A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.
19½Ã 23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters;
19½Ã 23:3 he restores my soul. He leads me in right paths for his name's sake.
19½Ã 23:4 Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff--they comfort me.
19½Ã 23:5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
19½Ã 23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD my whole life long.
19½Ã 24:1 Of David. A Psalm. The earth is the LORD's and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it;
19½Ã 24:2 for he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the rivers.
19½Ã 24:3 Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place?
19½Ã 24:4 Those who have clean hands and pure hearts, who do not lift up their souls to what is false, and do not swear deceitfully.
19½Ã 24:5 They will receive blessing from the LORD, and vindication from the God of their salvation.
19½Ã 24:6 Such is the company of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah
19½Ã 24:7 Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors! that the King of glory may come in.
19½Ã 24:8 Who is the King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle.
19½Ã 24:9 Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors! that the King of glory may come in.
19½Ã 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah
19½Ã 25:1 Of David. To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 25:2 O my God, in you I trust; do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.
19½Ã 25:3 Do not let those who wait for you be put to shame; let them be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
19½Ã 25:4 Make me to know your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths.
19½Ã 25:5 Lead me in your truth, and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all day long.
19½Ã 25:6 Be mindful of your mercy, O LORD, and of your steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
19½Ã 25:7 Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for your goodness' sake, O LORD!
19½Ã 25:8 Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
19½Ã 25:9 He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.
19½Ã 25:10 All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his decrees.
19½Ã 25:11 For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
19½Ã 25:12 Who are they that fear the LORD? He will teach them the way that they should choose.
19½Ã 25:13 They will abide in prosperity, and their children shall possess the land.
19½Ã 25:14 The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes his covenant known to them.
19½Ã 25:15 My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
19½Ã 25:16 Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
19½Ã 25:17 Relieve the troubles of my heart, and bring me out of my distress.
19½Ã 25:18 Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.
19½Ã 25:19 Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me.
19½Ã 25:20 O guard my life, and deliver me; do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
19½Ã 25:21 May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
19½Ã 25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all its troubles.
19½Ã 26:1 Of David. Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
19½Ã 26:2 Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and mind.
19½Ã 26:3 For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in faithfulness to you.
19½Ã 26:4 I do not sit with the worthless, nor do I consort with hypocrites;
19½Ã 26:5 I hate the company of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
19½Ã 26:6 I wash my hands in innocence, and go around your altar, O LORD,
19½Ã 26:7 singing aloud a song of thanksgiving, and telling all your wondrous deeds.
19½Ã 26:8 O LORD, I love the house in which you dwell, and the place where your glory abides.
19½Ã 26:9 Do not sweep me away with sinners, nor my life with the bloodthirsty,
19½Ã 26:10 those in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.
19½Ã 26:11 But as for me, I walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me.
19½Ã 26:12 My foot stands on level ground; in the great congregation I will bless the LORD.
19½Ã 27:1 Of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
19½Ã 27:2 When evildoers assail me to devour my flesh--my adversaries and foes--they shall stumble and fall.
19½Ã 27:3 Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident.
19½Ã 27:4 One thing I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: to live in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.
19½Ã 27:5 For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will set me high on a rock.
19½Ã 27:6 Now my head is lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD.
19½Ã 27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud, be gracious to me and answer me!
19½Ã 27:8 "Come," my heart says, "seek his face!" Your face, LORD, do I seek.
19½Ã 27:9 Do not hide your face from me. Do not turn your servant away in anger, you who have been my help. Do not cast me off, do not forsake me, O God of my salvation!
19½Ã 27:10 If my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will take me up.
19½Ã 27:11 Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
19½Ã 27:12 Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, and they are breathing out violence.
19½Ã 27:13 I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
19½Ã 27:14 Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!
19½Ã 28:1 Of David. To you, O LORD, I call; my rock, do not refuse to hear me, for if you are silent to me, I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
19½Ã 28:2 Hear the voice of my supplication, as I cry to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your most holy sanctuary.
19½Ã 28:3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who are workers of evil, who speak peace with their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts.
19½Ã 28:4 Repay them according to their work, and according to the evil of their deeds; repay them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.
19½Ã 28:5 Because they do not regard the works of the LORD, or the work of his hands, he will break them down and build them up no more.
19½Ã 28:6 Blessed be the LORD, for he has heard the sound of my pleadings.
19½Ã 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts; so I am helped, and my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.
19½Ã 28:8 The LORD is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed.
19½Ã 28:9 O save your people, and bless your heritage; be their shepherd, and carry them forever.
19½Ã 29:1 A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
19½Ã 29:2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory of his name; worship the LORD in holy splendor.
19½Ã 29:3 The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD, over mighty waters.
19½Ã 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
19½Ã 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
19½Ã 29:6 He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.
19½Ã 29:7 The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire.
19½Ã 29:8 The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
19½Ã 29:9 The voice of the LORD causes the oaks to whirl, and strips the forest bare; and in his temple all say, "Glory!"
19½Ã 29:10 The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever.
19½Ã 29:11 May the LORD give strength to his people! May the LORD bless his people with peace!
19½Ã 30:1 A Psalm. A Song at the dedication of the temple. Of David. I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up, and did not let my foes rejoice over me.
19½Ã 30:2 O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.
19½Ã 30:3 O LORD, you brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.
19½Ã 30:4 Sing praises to the LORD, O you his faithful ones, and give thanks to his holy name.
19½Ã 30:5 For his anger is but for a moment; his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may linger for the night, but joy comes with the morning.
19½Ã 30:6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."
19½Ã 30:7 By your favor, O LORD, you had established me as a strong mountain; you hid your face; I was dismayed.
19½Ã 30:8 To you, O LORD, I cried, and to the LORD I made supplication:
19½Ã 30:9 "What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?
19½Ã 30:10 Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me! O LORD, be my helper!"
19½Ã 30:11 You have turned my mourning into dancing; you have taken off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
19½Ã 30:12 so that my soul may praise you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.
19½Ã 31:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. In you, O LORD, I seek refuge; do not let me ever be put to shame; in your righteousness deliver me.
19½Ã 31:2 Incline your ear to me; rescue me speedily. Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me.
19½Ã 31:3 You are indeed my rock and my fortress; for your name's sake lead me and guide me,
19½Ã 31:4 take me out of the net that is hidden for me, for you are my refuge.
19½Ã 31:5 Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.
19½Ã 31:6 You hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 31:7 I will exult and rejoice in your steadfast love, because you have seen my affliction; you have taken heed of my adversities,
19½Ã 31:8 and have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place.
19½Ã 31:9 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eye wastes away from grief, my soul and body also.
19½Ã 31:10 For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my misery, and my bones waste away.
19½Ã 31:11 I am the scorn of all my adversaries, a horror to my neighbors, an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street flee from me.
19½Ã 31:12 I have passed out of mind like one who is dead; I have become like a broken vessel.
19½Ã 31:13 For I hear the whispering of many--terror all around!--as they scheme together against me, as they plot to take my life.
19½Ã 31:14 But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, "You are my God."
19½Ã 31:15 My times are in your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies and persecutors.
19½Ã 31:16 Let your face shine upon your servant; save me in your steadfast love.
19½Ã 31:17 Do not let me be put to shame, O LORD, for I call on you; let the wicked be put to shame; let them go dumbfounded to Sheol.
19½Ã 31:18 Let the lying lips be stilled that speak insolently against the righteous with pride and contempt.
19½Ã 31:19 O how abundant is your goodness that you have laid up for those who fear you, and accomplished for those who take refuge in you, in the sight of everyone!
19½Ã 31:20 In the shelter of your presence you hide them from human plots; you hold them safe under your shelter from contentious tongues.
19½Ã 31:21 Blessed be the LORD, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was beset as in a besieged city.
19½Ã 31:22 I had said in my alarm, "I am driven far from your sight." But you heard my supplications when I cried out to you for help.
19½Ã 31:23 Love the LORD, all you his saints. The LORD preserves the faithful, but abundantly repays the one who acts haughtily.
19½Ã 31:24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the LORD.
19½Ã 32:1 Of David. A Maskil. Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
19½Ã 32:2 Happy are those to whom the LORD imputes no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
19½Ã 32:3 While I kept silence, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long.
19½Ã 32:4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
19½Ã 32:5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not hide my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
19½Ã 32:6 Therefore let all who are faithful offer prayer to you; at a time of distress, the rush of mighty waters shall not reach them.
19½Ã 32:7 You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with glad cries of deliverance. Selah
19½Ã 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
19½Ã 32:9 Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding, whose temper must be curbed with bit and bridle, else it will not stay near you.
19½Ã 32:10 Many are the torments of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds those who trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 32:11 Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
19½Ã 33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous. Praise befits the upright.
19½Ã 33:2 Praise the LORD with the lyre; make melody to him with the harp of ten strings.
19½Ã 33:3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts.
19½Ã 33:4 For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.
19½Ã 33:5 He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD.
19½Ã 33:6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of his mouth.
19½Ã 33:7 He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle; he put the deeps in storehouses.
19½Ã 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
19½Ã 33:9 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.
19½Ã 33:10 The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples.
19½Ã 33:11 The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
19½Ã 33:12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage.
19½Ã 33:13 The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all humankind.
19½Ã 33:14 From where he sits enthroned he watches all the inhabitants of the earth--
19½Ã 33:15 he who fashions the hearts of them all, and observes all their deeds.
19½Ã 33:16 A king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
19½Ã 33:17 The war horse is a vain hope for victory, and by its great might it cannot save.
19½Ã 33:18 Truly the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love,
19½Ã 33:19 to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
19½Ã 33:20 Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and shield.
19½Ã 33:21 Our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name.
19½Ã 33:22 Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you.
19½Ã 34:1 Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away. I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
19½Ã 34:2 My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad.
19½Ã 34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
19½Ã 34:4 I sought the LORD, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
19½Ã 34:5 Look to him, and be radiant; so your faces shall never be ashamed.
19½Ã 34:6 This poor soul cried, and was heard by the LORD, and was saved from every trouble.
19½Ã 34:7 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.
19½Ã 34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good; happy are those who take refuge in him.
19½Ã 34:9 O fear the LORD, you his holy ones, for those who fear him have no want.
19½Ã 34:10 The young lions suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
19½Ã 34:11 Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
19½Ã 34:12 Which of you desires life, and covets many days to enjoy good?
19½Ã 34:13 Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
19½Ã 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
19½Ã 34:15 The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.
19½Ã 34:16 The face of the LORD is against evildoers, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
19½Ã 34:17 When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles.
19½Ã 34:18 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted, and saves the crushed in spirit.
19½Ã 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD rescues them from them all.
19½Ã 34:20 He keeps all their bones; not one of them will be broken.
19½Ã 34:21 Evil brings death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
19½Ã 34:22 The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
19½Ã 35:1 Of David. Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!
19½Ã 35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to help me!
19½Ã 35:3 Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers; say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
19½Ã 35:4 Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life. Let them be turned back and confounded who devise evil against me.
19½Ã 35:5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them on.
19½Ã 35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.
19½Ã 35:7 For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.
19½Ã 35:8 Let ruin come on them unawares. And let the net that they hid ensnare them; let them fall in it--to their ruin.
19½Ã 35:9 Then my soul shall rejoice in the LORD, exulting in his deliverance.
19½Ã 35:10 All my bones shall say, "O LORD, who is like you? You deliver the weak from those too strong for them, the weak and needy from those who despoil them."
19½Ã 35:11 Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me about things I do not know.
19½Ã 35:12 They repay me evil for good; my soul is forlorn.
19½Ã 35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed on my bosom,
19½Ã 35:14 as though I grieved for a friend or a brother; I went about as one who laments for a mother, bowed down and in mourning.
19½Ã 35:15 But at my stumbling they gathered in glee, they gathered together against me; ruffians whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing;
19½Ã 35:16 they impiously mocked more and more, gnashing at me with their teeth.
19½Ã 35:17 How long, O LORD, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my life from the lions!
19½Ã 35:18 Then I will thank you in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise you.
19½Ã 35:19 Do not let my treacherous enemies rejoice over me, or those who hate me without cause wink the eye.
19½Ã 35:20 For they do not speak peace, but they conceive deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
19½Ã 35:21 They open wide their mouths against me; they say, "Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it."
19½Ã 35:22 You have seen, O LORD; do not be silent! O Lord, do not be far from me!
19½Ã 35:23 Wake up! Bestir yourself for my defense, for my cause, my God and my Lord!
19½Ã 35:24 Vindicate me, O LORD, my God, according to your righteousness, and do not let them rejoice over me.
19½Ã 35:25 Do not let them say to themselves, "Aha, we have our heart's desire." Do not let them say, "We have swallowed you up."
19½Ã 35:26 Let all those who rejoice at my calamity be put to shame and confusion; let those who exalt themselves against me be clothed with shame and dishonor.
19½Ã 35:27 Let those who desire my vindication shout for joy and be glad, and say evermore, "Great is the LORD, who delights in the welfare of his servant."
19½Ã 35:28 Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness and of your praise all day long.
19½Ã 36:1 To the leader. Of David, the servant of the LORD. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in their hearts; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
19½Ã 36:2 For they flatter themselves in their own eyes that their iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
19½Ã 36:3 The words of their mouths are mischief and deceit; they have ceased to act wisely and do good.
19½Ã 36:4 They plot mischief while on their beds; they are set on a way that is not good; they do not reject evil.
19½Ã 36:5 Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
19½Ã 36:6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments are like the great deep; you save humans and animals alike, O LORD.
19½Ã 36:7 How precious is your steadfast love, O God! All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
19½Ã 36:8 They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
19½Ã 36:9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
19½Ã 36:10 O continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your salvation to the upright of heart!
19½Ã 36:11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me, or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19½Ã 36:12 There the evildoers lie prostrate; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
19½Ã 37:1 Of David. Do not fret because of the wicked; do not be envious of wrongdoers,
19½Ã 37:2 for they will soon fade like the grass, and wither like the green herb.
19½Ã 37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so you will live in the land, and enjoy security.
19½Ã 37:4 Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
19½Ã 37:5 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.
19½Ã 37:6 He will make your vindication shine like the light, and the justice of your cause like the noonday.
19½Ã 37:7 Be still before the LORD, and wait patiently for him; do not fret over those who prosper in their way, over those who carry out evil devices.
19½Ã 37:8 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath. Do not fret--it leads only to evil.
19½Ã 37:9 For the wicked shall be cut off, but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land.
19½Ã 37:10 Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look diligently for their place, they will not be there.
19½Ã 37:11 But the meek shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in abundant prosperity.
19½Ã 37:12 The wicked plot against the righteous, and gnash their teeth at them;
19½Ã 37:13 but the LORD laughs at the wicked, for he sees that their day is coming.
19½Ã 37:14 The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to kill those who walk uprightly;
19½Ã 37:15 their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
19½Ã 37:16 Better is a little that the righteous one has than the abundance of many wicked.
19½Ã 37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
19½Ã 37:18 The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will abide forever;
19½Ã 37:19 they are not put to shame in evil times, in the days of famine they have abundance.
19½Ã 37:20 But the wicked perish, and the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish--like smoke they vanish away.
19½Ã 37:21 The wicked borrow, and do not pay back, but the righteous are generous and keep giving;
19½Ã 37:22 for those blessed by the LORD shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
19½Ã 37:23 Our steps are made firm by the LORD, when he delights in our way;
19½Ã 37:24 though we stumble, we shall not fall headlong, for the LORD holds us by the hand.
19½Ã 37:25 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.
19½Ã 37:26 They are ever giving liberally and lending, and their children become a blessing.
19½Ã 37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; so you shall abide forever.
19½Ã 37:28 For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his faithful ones. The righteous shall be kept safe forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
19½Ã 37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.
19½Ã 37:30 The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak justice.
19½Ã 37:31 The law of their God is in their hearts; their steps do not slip.
19½Ã 37:32 The wicked watch for the righteous, and seek to kill them.
19½Ã 37:33 The LORD will not abandon them to their power, or let them be condemned when they are brought to trial.
19½Ã 37:34 Wait for the LORD, and keep to his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on the destruction of the wicked.
19½Ã 37:35 I have seen the wicked oppressing, and towering like a cedar of Lebanon.
19½Ã 37:36 Again I passed by, and they were no more; though I sought them, they could not be found.
19½Ã 37:37 Mark the blameless, and behold the upright, for there is posterity for the peaceable.
19½Ã 37:38 But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the posterity of the wicked shall be cut off.
19½Ã 37:39 The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their refuge in the time of trouble.
19½Ã 37:40 The LORD helps them and rescues them; he rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
19½Ã 38:1 A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering. O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.
19½Ã 38:2 For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.
19½Ã 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
19½Ã 38:4 For my iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.
19½Ã 38:5 My wounds grow foul and fester because of my foolishness;
19½Ã 38:6 I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all day long I go around mourning.
19½Ã 38:7 For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
19½Ã 38:8 I am utterly spent and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
19½Ã 38:9 O Lord, all my longing is known to you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19½Ã 38:10 My heart throbs, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes--it also has gone from me.
19½Ã 38:11 My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction, and my neighbors stand far off.
19½Ã 38:12 Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek to hurt me speak of ruin, and meditate treachery all day long.
19½Ã 38:13 But I am like the deaf, I do not hear; like the mute, who cannot speak.
19½Ã 38:14 Truly, I am like one who does not hear, and in whose mouth is no retort.
19½Ã 38:15 But it is for you, O LORD, that I wait; it is you, O LORD my God, who will answer.
19½Ã 38:16 For I pray, "Only do not let them rejoice over me, those who boast against me when my foot slips."
19½Ã 38:17 For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
19½Ã 38:18 I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.
19½Ã 38:19 Those who are my foes without cause are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
19½Ã 38:20 Those who render me evil for good are my adversaries because I follow after good.
19½Ã 38:21 Do not forsake me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me;
19½Ã 38:22 make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
19½Ã 39:1 To the leader: to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, "I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue; I will keep a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."
19½Ã 39:2 I was silent and still; I held my peace to no avail; my distress grew worse,
19½Ã 39:3 my heart became hot within me. While I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
19½Ã 39:4 "LORD, let me know my end, and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.
19½Ã 39:5 You have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing in your sight. Surely everyone stands as a mere breath. Selah
19½Ã 39:6 Surely everyone goes about like a shadow. Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; they heap up, and do not know who will gather.
19½Ã 39:7 "And now, O Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.
19½Ã 39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool.
19½Ã 39:9 I am silent; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it.
19½Ã 39:10 Remove your stroke from me; I am worn down by the blows of your hand.
19½Ã 39:11 "You chastise mortals in punishment for sin, consuming like a moth what is dear to them; surely everyone is a mere breath. Selah
19½Ã 39:12 "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; do not hold your peace at my tears. For I am your passing guest, an alien, like all my forebears.
19½Ã 39:13 Turn your gaze away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more."
19½Ã 40:1 To the leader. Of David. A Psalm. I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
19½Ã 40:2 He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
19½Ã 40:3 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 40:4 Happy are those who make the LORD their trust, who do not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after false gods.
19½Ã 40:5 You have multiplied, O LORD my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you. Were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can be counted.
19½Ã 40:6 Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
19½Ã 40:7 Then I said, "Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written of me.
19½Ã 40:8 I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."
19½Ã 40:9 I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; see, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O LORD.
19½Ã 40:10 I have not hidden your saving help within my heart, I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
19½Ã 40:11 Do not, O LORD, withhold your mercy from me; let your steadfast love and your faithfulness keep me safe forever.
19½Ã 40:12 For evils have encompassed me without number; my iniquities have overtaken me, until I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.
19½Ã 40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.
19½Ã 40:14 Let all those be put to shame and confusion who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt.
19½Ã 40:15 Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"
19½Ã 40:16 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, "Great is the LORD!"
19½Ã 40:17 As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God.
19½Ã 41:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. Happy are those who consider the poor; the LORD delivers them in the day of trouble.
19½Ã 41:2 The LORD protects them and keeps them alive; they are called happy in the land. You do not give them up to the will of their enemies.
19½Ã 41:3 The LORD sustains them on their sickbed; in their illness you heal all their infirmities.
19½Ã 41:4 As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you."
19½Ã 41:5 My enemies wonder in malice when I will die, and my name perish.
19½Ã 41:6 And when they come to see me, they utter empty words, while their hearts gather mischief; when they go out, they tell it abroad.
19½Ã 41:7 All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
19½Ã 41:8 They think that a deadly thing has fastened on me, that I will not rise again from where I lie.
19½Ã 41:9 Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted the heel against me.
19½Ã 41:10 But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.
19½Ã 41:11 By this I know that you are pleased with me; because my enemy has not triumphed over me.
19½Ã 41:12 But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
19½Ã 41:13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
19½Ã 42:1 To the leader. A Maskil of the Korahites. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God.
19½Ã 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?
19½Ã 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me continually, "Where is your God?"
19½Ã 42:4 These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I went with the throng, and led them in procession to the house of God, with glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
19½Ã 42:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help
19½Ã 42:6 and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
19½Ã 42:7 Deep calls to deep at the thunder of your cataracts; all your waves and your billows have gone over me.
19½Ã 42:8 By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
19½Ã 42:9 I say to God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk about mournfully because the enemy oppresses me?"
19½Ã 42:10 As with a deadly wound in my body, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me continually, "Where is your God?"
19½Ã 42:11 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.
19½Ã 43:1 Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people; from those who are deceitful and unjust deliver me!
19½Ã 43:2 For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you cast me off? Why must I walk about mournfully because of the oppression of the enemy?
19½Ã 43:3 O send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.
19½Ã 43:4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; and I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.
19½Ã 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.
19½Ã 44:1 To the leader. Of the Korahites. A Maskil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old:
19½Ã 44:2 you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
19½Ã 44:3 for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm give them victory; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, for you delighted in them.
19½Ã 44:4 You are my King and my God; you command victories for Jacob.
19½Ã 44:5 Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down our assailants.
19½Ã 44:6 For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
19½Ã 44:7 But you have saved us from our foes, and have put to confusion those who hate us.
19½Ã 44:8 In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah
19½Ã 44:9 Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies.
19½Ã 44:10 You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil.
19½Ã 44:11 You have made us like sheep for slaughter, and have scattered us among the nations.
19½Ã 44:12 You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.
19½Ã 44:13 You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.
19½Ã 44:14 You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
19½Ã 44:15 All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
19½Ã 44:16 at the words of the taunters and revilers, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
19½Ã 44:17 All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, or been false to your covenant.
19½Ã 44:18 Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way,
19½Ã 44:19 yet you have broken us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with deep darkness.
19½Ã 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god,
19½Ã 44:21 would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
19½Ã 44:22 Because of you we are being killed all day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
19½Ã 44:23 Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever!
19½Ã 44:24 Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
19½Ã 44:25 For we sink down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
19½Ã 44:26 Rise up, come to our help. Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.
19½Ã 45:1 To the leader: according to Lilies. Of the Korahites. A Maskil. A love song. My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
19½Ã 45:2 You are the most handsome of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.
19½Ã 45:3 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your glory and majesty.
19½Ã 45:4 In your majesty ride on victoriously for the cause of truth and to defend the right; let your right hand teach you dread deeds.
19½Ã 45:5 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.
19½Ã 45:6 Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;
19½Ã 45:7 you love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
19½Ã 45:8 your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
19½Ã 45:9 daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
19½Ã 45:10 Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear; forget your people and your father's house,
19½Ã 45:11 and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him;
19½Ã 45:12 the people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people
19½Ã 45:13 with all kinds of wealth. The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;
19½Ã 45:14 in many-colored robes she is led to the king; behind her the virgins, her companions, follow.
19½Ã 45:15 With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
19½Ã 45:16 In the place of ancestors you, O king, shall have sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.
19½Ã 45:17 I will cause your name to be celebrated in all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
19½Ã 46:1 To the leader. Of the Korahites. According to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
19½Ã 46:2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea;
19½Ã 46:3 though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble with its tumult. Selah
19½Ã 46:4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.
19½Ã 46:5 God is in the midst of the city; it shall not be moved; God will help it when the morning dawns.
19½Ã 46:6 The nations are in an uproar, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts.
19½Ã 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
19½Ã 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD; see what desolations he has brought on the earth.
19½Ã 46:9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.
19½Ã 46:10 "Be still, and know that I am God! I am exalted among the nations, I am exalted in the earth."
19½Ã 46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
19½Ã 47:1 To the leader. Of the Korahites. A Psalm. Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with loud songs of joy.
19½Ã 47:2 For the LORD, the Most High, is awesome, a great king over all the earth.
19½Ã 47:3 He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
19½Ã 47:4 He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah
19½Ã 47:5 God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
19½Ã 47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.
19½Ã 47:7 For God is the king of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm.
19½Ã 47:8 God is king over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.
19½Ã 47:9 The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted.
19½Ã 48:1 A Song. A Psalm of the Korahites. Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
19½Ã 48:2 beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.
19½Ã 48:3 Within its citadels God has shown himself a sure defense.
19½Ã 48:4 Then the kings assembled, they came on together.
19½Ã 48:5 As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic, they took to flight;
19½Ã 48:6 trembling took hold of them there, pains as of a woman in labor,
19½Ã 48:7 as when an east wind shatters the ships of Tarshish.
19½Ã 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God establishes forever. Selah
19½Ã 48:9 We ponder your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.
19½Ã 48:10 Your name, O God, like your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with victory.
19½Ã 48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad, let the cities of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
19½Ã 48:12 Walk about Zion, go all around it, count its towers,
19½Ã 48:13 consider well its ramparts; go through its citadels, that you may tell the next generation
19½Ã 48:14 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will be our guide forever.
19½Ã 49:1 To the leader. Of the Korahites. A Psalm. Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
19½Ã 49:2 both low and high, rich and poor together.
19½Ã 49:3 My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
19½Ã 49:4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the harp.
19½Ã 49:5 Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me,
19½Ã 49:6 those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
19½Ã 49:7 Truly, no ransom avails for one's life, there is no price one can give to God for it.
19½Ã 49:8 For the ransom of life is costly, and can never suffice
19½Ã 49:9 that one should live on forever and never see the grave.
19½Ã 49:10 When he looks at the wise, they die; fool and dolt perish together and leave their wealth to others.
19½Ã 49:11 Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they named lands their own.
19½Ã 49:12 Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; they are like the animals that perish.
19½Ã 49:13 Such is the fate of the foolhardy, the end of those who are pleased with their lot. Selah
19½Ã 49:14 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; straight to the grave they descend, and their form shall waste away; Sheol shall be their home.
19½Ã 49:15 But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah
19½Ã 49:16 Do not be afraid when some become rich, when the wealth of their houses increases.
19½Ã 49:17 For when they die they will carry nothing away; their wealth will not go down after them.
19½Ã 49:18 Though in their lifetime they count themselves happy--for you are praised when you do well for yourself--
19½Ã 49:19 they will go to the company of their ancestors, who will never again see the light.
19½Ã 49:20 Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; they are like the animals that perish.
19½Ã 50:1 A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty one, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
19½Ã 50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
19½Ã 50:3 Our God comes and does not keep silence, before him is a devouring fire, and a mighty tempest all around him.
19½Ã 50:4 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:
19½Ã 50:5 "Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"
19½Ã 50:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah
19½Ã 50:7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
19½Ã 50:8 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.
19½Ã 50:9 I will not accept a bull from your house, or goats from your folds.
19½Ã 50:10 For every wild animal of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
19½Ã 50:11 I know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine.
19½Ã 50:12 "If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all that is in it is mine.
19½Ã 50:13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
19½Ã 50:14 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High.
19½Ã 50:15 Call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."
19½Ã 50:16 But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite my statutes, or take my covenant on your lips?
19½Ã 50:17 For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.
19½Ã 50:18 You make friends with a thief when you see one, and you keep company with adulterers.
19½Ã 50:19 "You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
19½Ã 50:20 You sit and speak against your kin; you slander your own mother's child.
19½Ã 50:21 These things you have done and I have been silent; you thought that I was one just like yourself. But now I rebuke you, and lay the charge before you.
19½Ã 50:22 "Mark this, then, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and there will be no one to deliver.
19½Ã 50:23 Those who bring thanksgiving as their sacrifice honor me; to those who go the right way I will show the salvation of God."
19½Ã 51:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
19½Ã 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
19½Ã 51:3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
19½Ã 51:4 Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment.
19½Ã 51:5 Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.
19½Ã 51:6 You desire truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.
19½Ã 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
19½Ã 51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have crushed rejoice.
19½Ã 51:9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
19½Ã 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.
19½Ã 51:11 Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your holy spirit from me.
19½Ã 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain in me a willing spirit.
19½Ã 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
19½Ã 51:14 Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your deliverance.
19½Ã 51:15 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
19½Ã 51:16 For you have no delight in sacrifice; if I were to give a burnt offering, you would not be pleased.
19½Ã 51:17 The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
19½Ã 51:18 Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
19½Ã 51:19 then you will delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19½Ã 52:1 To the leader. A Maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came to Saul and said to him, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech." Why do you boast, O mighty one, of mischief done against the godly? All day long
19½Ã 52:2 you are plotting destruction. Your tongue is like a sharp razor, you worker of treachery.
19½Ã 52:3 You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking the truth. Selah
19½Ã 52:4 You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
19½Ã 52:5 But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
19½Ã 52:6 The righteous will see, and fear, and will laugh at the evildoer, saying,
19½Ã 52:7 "See the one who would not take refuge in God, but trusted in abundant riches, and sought refuge in wealth!"
19½Ã 52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.
19½Ã 52:9 I will thank you forever, because of what you have done. In the presence of the faithful I will proclaim your name, for it is good.
19½Ã 53:1 To the leader: according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David. Fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they commit abominable acts; there is no one who does good.
19½Ã 53:2 God looks down from heaven on humankind to see if there are any who are wise, who seek after God.
19½Ã 53:3 They have all fallen away, they are all alike perverse; there is no one who does good, no, not one.
19½Ã 53:4 Have they no knowledge, those evildoers, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
19½Ã 53:5 There they shall be in great terror, in terror such as has not been. For God will scatter the bones of the ungodly; they will be put to shame, for God has rejected them.
19½Ã 53:6 O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
19½Ã 54:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, "David is in hiding among us." Save me, O God, by your name, and vindicate me by your might.
19½Ã 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
19½Ã 54:3 For the insolent have risen against me, the ruthless seek my life; they do not set God before them. Selah
19½Ã 54:4 But surely, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
19½Ã 54:5 He will repay my enemies for their evil. In your faithfulness, put an end to them.
19½Ã 54:6 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good.
19½Ã 54:7 For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
19½Ã 55:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; do not hide yourself from my supplication.
19½Ã 55:2 Attend to me, and answer me; I am troubled in my complaint. I am distraught
19½Ã 55:3 by the noise of the enemy, because of the clamor of the wicked. For they bring trouble upon me, and in anger they cherish enmity against me.
19½Ã 55:4 My heart is in anguish within me, the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
19½Ã 55:5 Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
19½Ã 55:6 And I say, "O that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
19½Ã 55:7 Truly, I would flee far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah
19½Ã 55:8 I would hurry to find a shelter for myself from the raging wind and tempest."
19½Ã 55:9 Confuse, O Lord, confound their speech; for I see violence and strife in the city.
19½Ã 55:10 Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;
19½Ã 55:11 ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.
19½Ã 55:12 It is not enemies who taunt me--I could bear that; it is not adversaries who deal insolently with me--I could hide from them.
19½Ã 55:13 But it is you, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend,
19½Ã 55:14 with whom I kept pleasant company; we walked in the house of God with the throng.
19½Ã 55:15 Let death come upon them; let them go down alive to Sheol; for evil is in their homes and in their hearts.
19½Ã 55:16 But I call upon God, and the LORD will save me.
19½Ã 55:17 Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he will hear my voice.
19½Ã 55:18 He will redeem me unharmed from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
19½Ã 55:19 God, who is enthroned from of old, Selah will hear, and will humble them--because they do not change, and do not fear God.
19½Ã 55:20 My companion laid hands on a friend and violated a covenant with me
19½Ã 55:21 with speech smoother than butter, but with a heart set on war; with words that were softer than oil, but in fact were drawn swords.
19½Ã 55:22 Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
19½Ã 55:23 But you, O God, will cast them down into the lowest pit; the bloodthirsty and treacherous shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.
19½Ã 56:1 To the leader: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. Of David. A Miktam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be gracious to me, O God, for people trample on me; all day long foes oppress me;
19½Ã 56:2 my enemies trample on me all day long, for many fight against me. O Most High,
19½Ã 56:3 when I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
19½Ã 56:4 In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I am not afraid; what can flesh do to me?
19½Ã 56:5 All day long they seek to injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
19½Ã 56:6 They stir up strife, they lurk, they watch my steps. As they hoped to have my life,
19½Ã 56:7 so repay them for their crime; in wrath cast down the peoples, O God!
19½Ã 56:8 You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your record?
19½Ã 56:9 Then my enemies will retreat in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.
19½Ã 56:10 In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
19½Ã 56:11 in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can a mere mortal do to me?
19½Ã 56:12 My vows to you I must perform, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.
19½Ã 56:13 For you have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of life.
19½Ã 57:1 To the leader: Do Not Destroy. Of David. A Miktam, when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, until the destroying storms pass by.
19½Ã 57:2 I cry to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
19½Ã 57:3 He will send from heaven and save me, he will put to shame those who trample on me. Selah God will send forth his steadfast love and his faithfulness.
19½Ã 57:4 I lie down among lions that greedily devour human prey; their teeth are spears and arrows, their tongues sharp swords.
19½Ã 57:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
19½Ã 57:6 They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my path, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
19½Ã 57:7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make melody.
19½Ã 57:8 Awake, my soul! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn.
19½Ã 57:9 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.
19½Ã 57:10 For your steadfast love is as high as the heavens; your faithfulness extends to the clouds.
19½Ã 57:11 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
19½Ã 58:1 To the leader: Do Not Destroy. Of David. A Miktam. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge people fairly?
19½Ã 58:2 No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.
19½Ã 58:3 The wicked go astray from the womb; they err from their birth, speaking lies.
19½Ã 58:4 They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
19½Ã 58:5 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.
19½Ã 58:6 O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!
19½Ã 58:7 Let them vanish like water that runs away; like grass let them be trodden down and wither.
19½Ã 58:8 Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime; like the untimely birth that never sees the sun.
19½Ã 58:9 Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!
19½Ã 58:10 The righteous will rejoice when they see vengeance done; they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
19½Ã 58:11 People will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."
19½Ã 59:1 To the leader: Do Not Destroy. Of David. A Miktam, when Saul ordered his house to be watched in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
19½Ã 59:2 Deliver me from those who work evil; from the bloodthirsty save me.
19½Ã 59:3 Even now they lie in wait for my life; the mighty stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD,
19½Ã 59:4 for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Rouse yourself, come to my help and see!
19½Ã 59:5 You, LORD God of hosts, are God of Israel. Awake to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah
19½Ã 59:6 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
19½Ã 59:7 There they are, bellowing with their mouths, with sharp words on their lips--for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"
19½Ã 59:8 But you laugh at them, O LORD; you hold all the nations in derision.
19½Ã 59:9 O my strength, I will watch for you; for you, O God, are my fortress.
19½Ã 59:10 My God in his steadfast love will meet me; my God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
19½Ã 59:11 Do not kill them, or my people may forget; make them totter by your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
19½Ã 59:12 For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
19½Ã 59:13 consume them in wrath; consume them until they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
19½Ã 59:14 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
19½Ã 59:15 They roam about for food, and growl if they do not get their fill.
19½Ã 59:16 But I will sing of your might; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been a fortress for me and a refuge in the day of my distress.
19½Ã 59:17 O my strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.
19½Ã 60:1 To the leader: according to the Lily of the Covenant. A Miktam of David; for instruction; when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and when Joab on his return killed twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; now restore us!
19½Ã 60:2 You have caused the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair the cracks in it, for it is tottering.
19½Ã 60:3 You have made your people suffer hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us reel.
19½Ã 60:4 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, to rally to it out of bowshot. Selah
19½Ã 60:5 Give victory with your right hand, and answer us, so that those whom you love may be rescued.
19½Ã 60:6 God has promised in his sanctuary: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
19½Ã 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
19½Ã 60:8 Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I hurl my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19½Ã 60:9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19½Ã 60:10 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.
19½Ã 60:11 O grant us help against the foe, for human help is worthless.
19½Ã 60:12 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
19½Ã 61:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.
19½Ã 61:2 From the end of the earth I call to you, when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I;
19½Ã 61:3 for you are my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.
19½Ã 61:4 Let me abide in your tent forever, find refuge under the shelter of your wings. Selah
19½Ã 61:5 For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
19½Ã 61:6 Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!
19½Ã 61:7 May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!
19½Ã 61:8 So I will always sing praises to your name, as I pay my vows day after day.
19½Ã 62:1 To the leader: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.
19½Ã 62:2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall never be shaken.
19½Ã 62:3 How long will you assail a person, will you batter your victim, all of you, as you would a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
19½Ã 62:4 Their only plan is to bring down a person of prominence. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah
19½Ã 62:5 For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from him.
19½Ã 62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
19½Ã 62:7 On God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock, my refuge is in God.
19½Ã 62:8 Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah
19½Ã 62:9 Those of low estate are but a breath, those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.
19½Ã 62:10 Put no confidence in extortion, and set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
19½Ã 62:11 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,
19½Ã 62:12 and steadfast love belongs to you, O Lord. For you repay to all according to their work.
19½Ã 63:1 A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
19½Ã 63:2 So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.
19½Ã 63:3 Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
19½Ã 63:4 So I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands and call on your name.
19½Ã 63:5 My soul is satisfied as with a rich feast, and my mouth praises you with joyful lips
19½Ã 63:6 when I think of you on my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;
19½Ã 63:7 for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.
19½Ã 63:8 My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
19½Ã 63:9 But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;
19½Ã 63:10 they shall be given over to the power of the sword, they shall be prey for jackals.
19½Ã 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.
19½Ã 64:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from the dread enemy.
19½Ã 64:2 Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the scheming of evildoers,
19½Ã 64:3 who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,
19½Ã 64:4 shooting from ambush at the blameless; they shoot suddenly and without fear.
19½Ã 64:5 They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see us?
19½Ã 64:6 Who can search out our crimes? We have thought out a cunningly conceived plot." For the human heart and mind are deep.
19½Ã 64:7 But God will shoot his arrow at them; they will be wounded suddenly.
19½Ã 64:8 Because of their tongue he will bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake with horror.
19½Ã 64:9 Then everyone will fear; they will tell what God has brought about, and ponder what he has done.
19½Ã 64:10 Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him. Let all the upright in heart glory.
19½Ã 65:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. A Song. Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion; and to you shall vows be performed,
19½Ã 65:2 O you who answer prayer! To you all flesh shall come.
19½Ã 65:3 When deeds of iniquity overwhelm us, you forgive our transgressions.
19½Ã 65:4 Happy are those whom you choose and bring near to live in your courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
19½Ã 65:5 By awesome deeds you answer us with deliverance, O God of our salvation; you are the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
19½Ã 65:6 By your strength you established the mountains; you are girded with might.
19½Ã 65:7 You silence the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, the tumult of the peoples.
19½Ã 65:8 Those who live at earth's farthest bounds are awed by your signs; you make the gateways of the morning and the evening shout for joy.
19½Ã 65:9 You visit the earth and water it, you greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; you provide the people with grain, for so you have prepared it.
19½Ã 65:10 You water its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges, softening it with showers, and blessing its growth.
19½Ã 65:11 You crown the year with your bounty; your wagon tracks overflow with richness.
19½Ã 65:12 The pastures of the wilderness overflow, the hills gird themselves with joy,
19½Ã 65:13 the meadows clothe themselves with flocks, the valleys deck themselves with grain, they shout and sing together for joy.
19½Ã 66:1 To the leader. A Song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;
19½Ã 66:2 sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise.
19½Ã 66:3 Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! Because of your great power, your enemies cringe before you.
19½Ã 66:4 All the earth worships you; they sing praises to you, sing praises to your name." Selah
19½Ã 66:5 Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds among mortals.
19½Ã 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him,
19½Ã 66:7 who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations--let the rebellious not exalt themselves. Selah
19½Ã 66:8 Bless our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard,
19½Ã 66:9 who has kept us among the living, and has not let our feet slip.
19½Ã 66:10 For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried.
19½Ã 66:11 You brought us into the net; you laid burdens on our backs;
19½Ã 66:12 you let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a spacious place.
19½Ã 66:13 I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows,
19½Ã 66:14 those that my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
19½Ã 66:15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fatlings, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah
19½Ã 66:16 Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me.
19½Ã 66:17 I cried aloud to him, and he was extolled with my tongue.
19½Ã 66:18 If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
19½Ã 66:19 But truly God has listened; he has given heed to the words of my prayer.
19½Ã 66:20 Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me.
19½Ã 67:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song. May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face to shine upon us, Selah
19½Ã 67:2 that your way may be known upon earth, your saving power among all nations.
19½Ã 67:3 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you.
19½Ã 67:4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you judge the peoples with equity and guide the nations upon earth. Selah
19½Ã 67:5 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you.
19½Ã 67:6 The earth has yielded its increase; God, our God, has blessed us.
19½Ã 67:7 May God continue to bless us; let all the ends of the earth revere him.
19½Ã 68:1 To the leader. Of David. A Psalm. A Song. Let God rise up, let his enemies be scattered; let those who hate him flee before him.
19½Ã 68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, let the wicked perish before God.
19½Ã 68:3 But let the righteous be joyful; let them exult before God; let them be jubilant with joy.
19½Ã 68:4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds--his name is the LORD--be exultant before him.
19½Ã 68:5 Father of orphans and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.
19½Ã 68:6 God gives the desolate a home to live in; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious live in a parched land.
19½Ã 68:7 O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah
19½Ã 68:8 the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
19½Ã 68:9 Rain in abundance, O God, you showered abroad; you restored your heritage when it languished;
19½Ã 68:10 your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.
19½Ã 68:11 The Lord gives the command; great is the company of those who bore the tidings:
19½Ã 68:12 "The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil,
19½Ã 68:13 though they stay among the sheepfolds--the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with green gold.
19½Ã 68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings there, snow fell on Zalmon.
19½Ã 68:15 O mighty mountain, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!
19½Ã 68:16 Why do you look with envy, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, where the LORD will reside forever?
19½Ã 68:17 With mighty chariotry, twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands, the Lord came from Sinai into the holy place.
19½Ã 68:18 You ascended the high mount, leading captives in your train and receiving gifts from people, even from those who rebel against the LORD God's abiding there.
19½Ã 68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah
19½Ã 68:20 Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD, the Lord, belongs escape from death.
19½Ã 68:21 But God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways.
19½Ã 68:22 The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
19½Ã 68:23 so that you may bathe your feet in blood, so that the tongues of your dogs may have their share from the foe."
19½Ã 68:24 Your solemn processions are seen, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary--
19½Ã 68:25 the singers in front, the musicians last, between them girls playing tambourines:
19½Ã 68:26 "Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"
19½Ã 68:27 There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in a body, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
19½Ã 68:28 Summon your might, O God; show your strength, O God, as you have done for us before.
19½Ã 68:29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings bear gifts to you.
19½Ã 68:30 Rebuke the wild animals that live among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample under foot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.
19½Ã 68:31 Let bronze be brought from Egypt; let Ethiopia hasten to stretch out its hands to God.
19½Ã 68:32 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord, Selah
19½Ã 68:33 O rider in the heavens, the ancient heavens; listen, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.
19½Ã 68:34 Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel; and whose power is in the skies.
19½Ã 68:35 Awesome is God in his sanctuary, the God of Israel; he gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!
19½Ã 69:1 To the leader: according to Lilies. Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
19½Ã 69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
19½Ã 69:3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.
19½Ã 69:4 More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; many are those who would destroy me, my enemies who accuse me falsely. What I did not steal must I now restore?
19½Ã 69:5 O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.
19½Ã 69:6 Do not let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, O Lord GOD of hosts; do not let those who seek you be dishonored because of me, O God of Israel.
19½Ã 69:7 It is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has covered my face.
19½Ã 69:8 I have become a stranger to my kindred, an alien to my mother's children.
19½Ã 69:9 It is zeal for your house that has consumed me; the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.
19½Ã 69:10 When I humbled my soul with fasting, they insulted me for doing so.
19½Ã 69:11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
19½Ã 69:12 I am the subject of gossip for those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.
19½Ã 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love, answer me. With your faithful help
19½Ã 69:14 rescue me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.
19½Ã 69:15 Do not let the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the Pit close its mouth over me.
19½Ã 69:16 Answer me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.
19½Ã 69:17 Do not hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress--make haste to answer me.
19½Ã 69:18 Draw near to me, redeem me, set me free because of my enemies.
19½Ã 69:19 You know the insults I receive, and my shame and dishonor; my foes are all known to you.
19½Ã 69:20 Insults have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
19½Ã 69:21 They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
19½Ã 69:22 Let their table be a trap for them, a snare for their allies.
19½Ã 69:23 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
19½Ã 69:24 Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
19½Ã 69:25 May their camp be a desolation; let no one live in their tents.
19½Ã 69:26 For they persecute those whom you have struck down, and those whom you have wounded, they attack still more.
19½Ã 69:27 Add guilt to their guilt; may they have no acquittal from you.
19½Ã 69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.
19½Ã 69:29 But I am lowly and in pain; let your salvation, O God, protect me.
19½Ã 69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
19½Ã 69:31 This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.
19½Ã 69:32 Let the oppressed see it and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
19½Ã 69:33 For the LORD hears the needy, and does not despise his own that are in bonds.
19½Ã 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.
19½Ã 69:35 For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and his servants shall live there and possess it;
19½Ã 69:36 the children of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall live in it.
19½Ã 70:1 To the leader. Of David, for the memorial offering. Be pleased, O God, to deliver me. O LORD, make haste to help me!
19½Ã 70:2 Let those be put to shame and confusion who seek my life. Let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire to hurt me.
19½Ã 70:3 Let those who say, "Aha, Aha!" turn back because of their shame.
19½Ã 70:4 Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!"
19½Ã 70:5 But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!
19½Ã 71:1 In you, O LORD, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame.
19½Ã 71:2 In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me and save me.
19½Ã 71:3 Be to me a rock of refuge, a strong fortress, to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
19½Ã 71:4 Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
19½Ã 71:5 For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth.
19½Ã 71:6 Upon you I have leaned from my birth; it was you who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of you.
19½Ã 71:7 I have been like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.
19½Ã 71:8 My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all day long.
19½Ã 71:9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age; do not forsake me when my strength is spent.
19½Ã 71:10 For my enemies speak concerning me, and those who watch for my life consult together.
19½Ã 71:11 They say, "Pursue and seize that person whom God has forsaken, for there is no one to deliver."
19½Ã 71:12 O God, do not be far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!
19½Ã 71:13 Let my accusers be put to shame and consumed; let those who seek to hurt me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
19½Ã 71:14 But I will hope continually, and will praise you yet more and more.
19½Ã 71:15 My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all day long, though their number is past my knowledge.
19½Ã 71:16 I will come praising the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD, I will praise your righteousness, yours alone.
19½Ã 71:17 O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.
19½Ã 71:18 So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to all the generations to come. Your power
19½Ã 71:19 and your righteousness, O God, reach the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?
19½Ã 71:20 You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
19½Ã 71:21 You will increase my honor, and comfort me once again.
19½Ã 71:22 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 71:23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have rescued.
19½Ã 71:24 All day long my tongue will talk of your righteous help, for those who tried to do me harm have been put to shame, and disgraced.
19½Ã 72:1 Of Solomon. Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to a king's son.
19½Ã 72:2 May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.
19½Ã 72:3 May the mountains yield prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness.
19½Ã 72:4 May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the needy, and crush the oppressor.
19½Ã 72:5 May he live while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
19½Ã 72:6 May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.
19½Ã 72:7 In his days may righteousness flourish and peace abound, until the moon is no more.
19½Ã 72:8 May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
19½Ã 72:9 May his foes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.
19½Ã 72:10 May the kings of Tarshish and of the isles render him tribute, may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts.
19½Ã 72:11 May all kings fall down before him, all nations give him service.
19½Ã 72:12 For he delivers the needy when they call, the poor and those who have no helper.
19½Ã 72:13 He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy.
19½Ã 72:14 From oppression and violence he redeems their life; and precious is their blood in his sight.
19½Ã 72:15 Long may he live! May gold of Sheba be given to him. May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all day long.
19½Ã 72:16 May there be abundance of grain in the land; may it wave on the tops of the mountains; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field.
19½Ã 72:17 May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun. May all nations be blessed in him; may they pronounce him happy.
19½Ã 72:18 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
19½Ã 72:19 Blessed be his glorious name forever; may his glory fill the whole earth. Amen and Amen.
19½Ã 72:20 The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended.
19½Ã 73:1 A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to the upright, to those who are pure in heart.
19½Ã 73:2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.
19½Ã 73:3 For I was envious of the arrogant; I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19½Ã 73:4 For they have no pain; their bodies are sound and sleek.
19½Ã 73:5 They are not in trouble as others are; they are not plagued like other people.
19½Ã 73:6 Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them like a garment.
19½Ã 73:7 Their eyes swell out with fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.
19½Ã 73:8 They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.
19½Ã 73:9 They set their mouths against heaven, and their tongues range over the earth.
19½Ã 73:10 Therefore the people turn and praise them, and find no fault in them.
19½Ã 73:11 And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
19½Ã 73:12 Such are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.
19½Ã 73:13 All in vain I have kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.
19½Ã 73:14 For all day long I have been plagued, and am punished every morning.
19½Ã 73:15 If I had said, "I will talk on in this way," I would have been untrue to the circle of your children.
19½Ã 73:16 But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,
19½Ã 73:17 until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.
19½Ã 73:18 Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.
19½Ã 73:19 How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!
19½Ã 73:20 They are like a dream when one awakes; on awaking you despise their phantoms.
19½Ã 73:21 When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,
19½Ã 73:22 I was stupid and ignorant; I was like a brute beast toward you.
19½Ã 73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
19½Ã 73:24 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me with honor.
19½Ã 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire other than you.
19½Ã 73:26 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19½Ã 73:27 Indeed, those who are far from you will perish; you put an end to those who are false to you.
19½Ã 73:28 But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, to tell of all your works.
19½Ã 74:1 A Maskil of Asaph. O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
19½Ã 74:2 Remember your congregation, which you acquired long ago, which you redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage. Remember Mount Zion, where you came to dwell.
19½Ã 74:3 Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.
19½Ã 74:4 Your foes have roared within your holy place; they set up their emblems there.
19½Ã 74:5 At the upper entrance they hacked the wooden trellis with axes.
19½Ã 74:6 And then, with hatchets and hammers, they smashed all its carved work.
19½Ã 74:7 They set your sanctuary on fire; they desecrated the dwelling place of your name, bringing it to the ground.
19½Ã 74:8 They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
19½Ã 74:9 We do not see our emblems; there is no longer any prophet, and there is no one among us who knows how long.
19½Ã 74:10 How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever?
19½Ã 74:11 Why do you hold back your hand; why do you keep your hand in your bosom?
19½Ã 74:12 Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the earth.
19½Ã 74:13 You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.
19½Ã 74:14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
19½Ã 74:15 You cut openings for springs and torrents; you dried up ever-flowing streams.
19½Ã 74:16 Yours is the day, yours also the night; you established the luminaries and the sun.
19½Ã 74:17 You have fixed all the bounds of the earth; you made summer and winter.
19½Ã 74:18 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and an impious people reviles your name.
19½Ã 74:19 Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild animals; do not forget the life of your poor forever.
19½Ã 74:20 Have regard for your covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the haunts of violence.
19½Ã 74:21 Do not let the downtrodden be put to shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.
19½Ã 74:22 Rise up, O God, plead your cause; remember how the impious scoff at you all day long.
19½Ã 74:23 Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of your adversaries that goes up continually.
19½Ã 75:1 To the leader: Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks; your name is near. People tell of your wondrous deeds.
19½Ã 75:2 At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity.
19½Ã 75:3 When the earth totters, with all its inhabitants, it is I who keep its pillars steady. Selah
19½Ã 75:4 I say to the boastful, "Do not boast," and to the wicked, "Do not lift up your horn;
19½Ã 75:5 do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with insolent neck."
19½Ã 75:6 For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up;
19½Ã 75:7 but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.
19½Ã 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed; he will pour a draught from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.
19½Ã 75:9 But I will rejoice forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 75:10 All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
19½Ã 76:1 To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. In Judah God is known, his name is great in Israel.
19½Ã 76:2 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
19½Ã 76:3 There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah
19½Ã 76:4 Glorious are you, more majestic than the everlasting mountains.
19½Ã 76:5 The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; none of the troops was able to lift a hand.
19½Ã 76:6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned.
19½Ã 76:7 But you indeed are awesome! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused?
19½Ã 76:8 From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still
19½Ã 76:9 when God rose up to establish judgment, to save all the oppressed of the earth. Selah
19½Ã 76:10 Human wrath serves only to praise you, when you bind the last bit of your wrath around you.
19½Ã 76:11 Make vows to the LORD your God, and perform them; let all who are around him bring gifts to the one who is awesome,
19½Ã 76:12 who cuts off the spirit of princes, who inspires fear in the kings of the earth.
19½Ã 77:1 To the leader: according to Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A Psalm. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, that he may hear me.
19½Ã 77:2 In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.
19½Ã 77:3 I think of God, and I moan; I meditate, and my spirit faints. Selah
19½Ã 77:4 You keep my eyelids from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
19½Ã 77:5 I consider the days of old, and remember the years of long ago.
19½Ã 77:6 I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit:
19½Ã 77:7 "Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?
19½Ã 77:8 Has his steadfast love ceased forever? Are his promises at an end for all time?
19½Ã 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah
19½Ã 77:10 And I say, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed."
19½Ã 77:11 I will call to mind the deeds of the LORD; I will remember your wonders of old.
19½Ã 77:12 I will meditate on all your work, and muse on your mighty deeds.
19½Ã 77:13 Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?
19½Ã 77:14 You are the God who works wonders; you have displayed your might among the peoples.
19½Ã 77:15 With your strong arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
19½Ã 77:16 When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; the very deep trembled.
19½Ã 77:17 The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; your arrows flashed on every side.
19½Ã 77:18 The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
19½Ã 77:19 Your way was through the sea, your path, through the mighty waters; yet your footprints were unseen.
19½Ã 77:20 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19½Ã 78:1 A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
19½Ã 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,
19½Ã 78:3 things that we have heard and known, that our ancestors have told us.
19½Ã 78:4 We will not hide them from their children; we will tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.
19½Ã 78:5 He established a decree in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children;
19½Ã 78:6 that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and rise up and tell them to their children,
19½Ã 78:7 so that they should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
19½Ã 78:8 and that they should not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
19½Ã 78:9 The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.
19½Ã 78:10 They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.
19½Ã 78:11 They forgot what he had done, and the miracles that he had shown them.
19½Ã 78:12 In the sight of their ancestors he worked marvels in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
19½Ã 78:13 He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.
19½Ã 78:14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all night long with a fiery light.
19½Ã 78:15 He split rocks open in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
19½Ã 78:16 He made streams come out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
19½Ã 78:17 Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
19½Ã 78:18 They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.
19½Ã 78:19 They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
19½Ã 78:20 Even though he struck the rock so that water gushed out and torrents overflowed, can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?"
19½Ã 78:21 Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of rage; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel,
19½Ã 78:22 because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.
19½Ã 78:23 Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;
19½Ã 78:24 he rained down on them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.
19½Ã 78:25 Mortals ate of the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance.
19½Ã 78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;
19½Ã 78:27 he rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;
19½Ã 78:28 he let them fall within their camp, all around their dwellings.
19½Ã 78:29 And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
19½Ã 78:30 But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
19½Ã 78:31 the anger of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them, and laid low the flower of Israel.
19½Ã 78:32 In spite of all this they still sinned; they did not believe in his wonders.
19½Ã 78:33 So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.
19½Ã 78:34 When he killed them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.
19½Ã 78:35 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.
19½Ã 78:36 But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
19½Ã 78:37 Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.
19½Ã 78:38 Yet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; often he restrained his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.
19½Ã 78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not come again.
19½Ã 78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
19½Ã 78:41 They tested God again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 78:42 They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;
19½Ã 78:43 when he displayed his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zoan.
19½Ã 78:44 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
19½Ã 78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
19½Ã 78:46 He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
19½Ã 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.
19½Ã 78:48 He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.
19½Ã 78:49 He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
19½Ã 78:50 He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
19½Ã 78:51 He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.
19½Ã 78:52 Then he led out his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
19½Ã 78:53 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
19½Ã 78:54 And he brought them to his holy hill, to the mountain that his right hand had won.
19½Ã 78:55 He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
19½Ã 78:56 Yet they tested the Most High God, and rebelled against him. They did not observe his decrees,
19½Ã 78:57 but turned away and were faithless like their ancestors; they twisted like a treacherous bow.
19½Ã 78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
19½Ã 78:59 When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
19½Ã 78:60 He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mortals,
19½Ã 78:61 and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.
19½Ã 78:62 He gave his people to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.
19½Ã 78:63 Fire devoured their young men, and their girls had no marriage song.
19½Ã 78:64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
19½Ã 78:65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior shouting because of wine.
19½Ã 78:66 He put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting disgrace.
19½Ã 78:67 He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
19½Ã 78:68 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
19½Ã 78:69 He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.
19½Ã 78:70 He chose his servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds;
19½Ã 78:71 from tending the nursing ewes he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel, his inheritance.
19½Ã 78:72 With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skillful hand.
19½Ã 79:1 A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
19½Ã 79:2 They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the air for food, the flesh of your faithful to the wild animals of the earth.
19½Ã 79:3 They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
19½Ã 79:4 We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.
19½Ã 79:5 How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealous wrath burn like fire?
19½Ã 79:6 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
19½Ã 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.
19½Ã 79:8 Do not remember against us the iniquities of our ancestors; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.
19½Ã 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
19½Ã 79:10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes.
19½Ã 79:11 Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power preserve those doomed to die.
19½Ã 79:12 Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors the taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord!
19½Ã 79:13 Then we your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
19½Ã 80:1 To the leader: on Lilies, a Covenant. Of Asaph. A Psalm. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth
19½Ã 80:2 before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh. Stir up your might, and come to save us!
19½Ã 80:3 Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
19½Ã 80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?
19½Ã 80:5 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in full measure.
19½Ã 80:6 You make us the scorn of our neighbors; our enemies laugh among themselves.
19½Ã 80:7 Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
19½Ã 80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
19½Ã 80:9 You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
19½Ã 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches;
19½Ã 80:11 it sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.
19½Ã 80:12 Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
19½Ã 80:13 The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
19½Ã 80:14 Turn again, O God of hosts; look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,
19½Ã 80:15 the stock that your right hand planted.
19½Ã 80:16 They have burned it with fire, they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
19½Ã 80:17 But let your hand be upon the one at your right hand, the one whom you made strong for yourself.
19½Ã 80:18 Then we will never turn back from you; give us life, and we will call on your name.
19½Ã 80:19 Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
19½Ã 81:1 To the leader: according to The Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 81:2 Raise a song, sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.
19½Ã 81:3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our festal day.
19½Ã 81:4 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 81:5 He made it a decree in Joseph, when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a voice I had not known:
19½Ã 81:6 "I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.
19½Ã 81:7 In distress you called, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
19½Ã 81:8 Hear, O my people, while I admonish you; O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
19½Ã 81:9 There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
19½Ã 81:10 I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
19½Ã 81:11 "But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.
19½Ã 81:12 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.
19½Ã 81:13 O that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
19½Ã 81:14 Then I would quickly subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their foes.
19½Ã 81:15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their doom would last forever.
19½Ã 81:16 I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
19½Ã 82:1 A Psalm of Asaph. God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:
19½Ã 82:2 "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
19½Ã 82:3 Give justice to the weak and the orphan; maintain the right of the lowly and the destitute.
19½Ã 82:4 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."
19½Ã 82:5 They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk around in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
19½Ã 82:6 I say, "You are gods, children of the Most High, all of you;
19½Ã 82:7 nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, and fall like any prince."
19½Ã 82:8 Rise up, O God, judge the earth; for all the nations belong to you!
19½Ã 83:1 A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God!
19½Ã 83:2 Even now your enemies are in tumult; those who hate you have raised their heads.
19½Ã 83:3 They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against those you protect.
19½Ã 83:4 They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more."
19½Ã 83:5 They conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant--
19½Ã 83:6 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
19½Ã 83:7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
19½Ã 83:8 Assyria also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah
19½Ã 83:9 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the Wadi Kishon,
19½Ã 83:10 who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground.
19½Ã 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
19½Ã 83:12 who said, "Let us take the pastures of God for our own possession."
19½Ã 83:13 O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind.
19½Ã 83:14 As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
19½Ã 83:15 so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane.
19½Ã 83:16 Fill their faces with shame, so that they may seek your name, O LORD.
19½Ã 83:17 Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace.
19½Ã 83:18 Let them know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
19½Ã 84:1 To the leader: according to The Gittith. Of the Korahites. A Psalm. How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts!
19½Ã 84:2 My soul longs, indeed it faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
19½Ã 84:3 Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.
19½Ã 84:4 Happy are those who live in your house, ever singing your praise. Selah
19½Ã 84:5 Happy are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
19½Ã 84:6 As they go through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools.
19½Ã 84:7 They go from strength to strength; the God of gods will be seen in Zion.
19½Ã 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah
19½Ã 84:9 Behold our shield, O God; look on the face of your anointed.
19½Ã 84:10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than live in the tents of wickedness.
19½Ã 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; he bestows favor and honor. No good thing does the LORD withhold from those who walk uprightly.
19½Ã 84:12 O LORD of hosts, happy is everyone who trusts in you.
19½Ã 85:1 To the leader. Of the Korahites. A Psalm. LORD, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
19½Ã 85:2 You forgave the iniquity of your people; you pardoned all their sin. Selah
19½Ã 85:3 You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your hot anger.
19½Ã 85:4 Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us.
19½Ã 85:5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger to all generations?
19½Ã 85:6 Will you not revive us again, so that your people may rejoice in you?
19½Ã 85:7 Show us your steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.
19½Ã 85:8 Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his faithful, to those who turn to him in their hearts.
19½Ã 85:9 Surely his salvation is at hand for those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
19½Ã 85:10 Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet; righteousness and peace will kiss each other.
19½Ã 85:11 Faithfulness will spring up from the ground, and righteousness will look down from the sky.
19½Ã 85:12 The LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase.
19½Ã 85:13 Righteousness will go before him, and will make a path for his steps.
19½Ã 86:1 A Prayer of David. Incline your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
19½Ã 86:2 Preserve my life, for I am devoted to you; save your servant who trusts in you. You are my God;
19½Ã 86:3 be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all day long.
19½Ã 86:4 Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 86:5 For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call on you.
19½Ã 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; listen to my cry of supplication.
19½Ã 86:7 In the day of my trouble I call on you, for you will answer me.
19½Ã 86:8 There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
19½Ã 86:9 All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.
19½Ã 86:10 For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God.
19½Ã 86:11 Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart to revere your name.
19½Ã 86:12 I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever.
19½Ã 86:13 For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
19½Ã 86:14 O God, the insolent rise up against me; a band of ruffians seeks my life, and they do not set you before them.
19½Ã 86:15 But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
19½Ã 86:16 Turn to me and be gracious to me; give your strength to your servant; save the child of your serving girl.
19½Ã 86:17 Show me a sign of your favor, so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame, because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
19½Ã 87:1 Of the Korahites. A Psalm. A Song. On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
19½Ã 87:2 the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
19½Ã 87:3 Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah
19½Ã 87:4 Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; Philistia too, and Tyre, with Ethiopia--"This one was born there," they say.
19½Ã 87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in it"; for the Most High himself will establish it.
19½Ã 87:6 The LORD records, as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah
19½Ã 87:7 Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you."
19½Ã 88:1 A Song. A Psalm of the Korahites. To the leader: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, God of my salvation, when, at night, I cry out in your presence,
19½Ã 88:2 let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry.
19½Ã 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.
19½Ã 88:4 I am counted among those who go down to the Pit; I am like those who have no help,
19½Ã 88:5 like those forsaken among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.
19½Ã 88:6 You have put me in the depths of the Pit, in the regions dark and deep.
19½Ã 88:7 Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah
19½Ã 88:8 You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a thing of horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;
19½Ã 88:9 my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call on you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you.
19½Ã 88:10 Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the shades rise up to praise you? Selah
19½Ã 88:11 Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?
19½Ã 88:12 Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your saving help in the land of forgetfulness?
19½Ã 88:13 But I, O LORD, cry out to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
19½Ã 88:14 O LORD, why do you cast me off? Why do you hide your face from me?
19½Ã 88:15 Wretched and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am desperate.
19½Ã 88:16 Your wrath has swept over me; your dread assaults destroy me.
19½Ã 88:17 They surround me like a flood all day long; from all sides they close in on me.
19½Ã 88:18 You have caused friend and neighbor to shun me; my companions are in darkness.
19½Ã 89:1 A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of your steadfast love, O LORD, forever; with my mouth I will proclaim your faithfulness to all generations.
19½Ã 89:2 I declare that your steadfast love is established forever; your faithfulness is as firm as the heavens.
19½Ã 89:3 You said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to my servant David:
19½Ã 89:4 'I will establish your descendants forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah
19½Ã 89:5 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones.
19½Ã 89:6 For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD,
19½Ã 89:7 a God feared in the council of the holy ones, great and awesome above all that are around him?
19½Ã 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is as mighty as you, O LORD? Your faithfulness surrounds you.
19½Ã 89:9 You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.
19½Ã 89:10 You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
19½Ã 89:11 The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it--you have founded them.
19½Ã 89:12 The north and the south--you created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.
19½Ã 89:13 You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.
19½Ã 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.
19½Ã 89:15 Happy are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance;
19½Ã 89:16 they exult in your name all day long, and extol your righteousness.
19½Ã 89:17 For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted.
19½Ã 89:18 For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 89:19 Then you spoke in a vision to your faithful one, and said: "I have set the crown on one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.
19½Ã 89:20 I have found my servant David; with my holy oil I have anointed him;
19½Ã 89:21 my hand shall always remain with him; my arm also shall strengthen him.
19½Ã 89:22 The enemy shall not outwit him, the wicked shall not humble him.
19½Ã 89:23 I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
19½Ã 89:24 My faithfulness and steadfast love shall be with him; and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
19½Ã 89:25 I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.
19½Ã 89:26 He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation!'
19½Ã 89:27 I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
19½Ã 89:28 Forever I will keep my steadfast love for him, and my covenant with him will stand firm.
19½Ã 89:29 I will establish his line forever, and his throne as long as the heavens endure.
19½Ã 89:30 If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my ordinances,
19½Ã 89:31 if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
19½Ã 89:32 then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with scourges;
19½Ã 89:33 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love, or be false to my faithfulness.
19½Ã 89:34 I will not violate my covenant, or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
19½Ã 89:35 Once and for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
19½Ã 89:36 His line shall continue forever, and his throne endure before me like the sun.
19½Ã 89:37 It shall be established forever like the moon, an enduring witness in the skies." Selah
19½Ã 89:38 But now you have spurned and rejected him; you are full of wrath against your anointed.
19½Ã 89:39 You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.
19½Ã 89:40 You have broken through all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.
19½Ã 89:41 All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
19½Ã 89:42 You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
19½Ã 89:43 Moreover, you have turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not supported him in battle.
19½Ã 89:44 You have removed the scepter from his hand, and hurled his throne to the ground.
19½Ã 89:45 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah
19½Ã 89:46 How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
19½Ã 89:47 Remember how short my time is-- for what vanity you have created all mortals!
19½Ã 89:48 Who can live and never see death? Who can escape the power of Sheol? Selah
19½Ã 89:49 Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?
19½Ã 89:50 Remember, O Lord, how your servant is taunted; how I bear in my bosom the insults of the peoples,
19½Ã 89:51 with which your enemies taunt, O LORD, with which they taunted the footsteps of your anointed.
19½Ã 89:52 Blessed be the LORD forever. Amen and Amen.
19½Ã 90:1 A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
19½Ã 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
19½Ã 90:3 You turn us back to dust, and say, "Turn back, you mortals."
19½Ã 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past, or like a watch in the night.
19½Ã 90:5 You sweep them away; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning;
19½Ã 90:6 in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.
19½Ã 90:7 For we are consumed by your anger; by your wrath we are overwhelmed.
19½Ã 90:8 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
19½Ã 90:9 For all our days pass away under your wrath; our years come to an end like a sigh.
19½Ã 90:10 The days of our life are seventy years, or perhaps eighty, if we are strong; even then their span is only toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.
19½Ã 90:11 Who considers the power of your anger? Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.
19½Ã 90:12 So teach us to count our days that we may gain a wise heart.
19½Ã 90:13 Turn, O LORD! How long? Have compassion on your servants!
19½Ã 90:14 Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
19½Ã 90:15 Make us glad as many days as you have afflicted us, and as many years as we have seen evil.
19½Ã 90:16 Let your work be manifest to your servants, and your glorious power to their children.
19½Ã 90:17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and prosper for us the work of our hands--O prosper the work of our hands!
19½Ã 91:1 You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,
19½Ã 91:2 will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."
19½Ã 91:3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence;
19½Ã 91:4 he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
19½Ã 91:5 You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day,
19½Ã 91:6 or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, or the destruction that wastes at noonday.
19½Ã 91:7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
19½Ã 91:8 You will only look with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
19½Ã 91:9 Because you have made the LORD your refuge, the Most High your dwelling place,
19½Ã 91:10 no evil shall befall you, no scourge come near your tent.
19½Ã 91:11 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
19½Ã 91:12 On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.
19½Ã 91:13 You will tread on the lion and the adder, the young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot.
19½Ã 91:14 Those who love me, I will deliver; I will protect those who know my name.
19½Ã 91:15 When they call to me, I will answer them; I will be with them in trouble, I will rescue them and honor them.
19½Ã 91:16 With long life I will satisfy them, and show them my salvation.
19½Ã 92:1 A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath Day. It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
19½Ã 92:2 to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
19½Ã 92:3 to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
19½Ã 92:4 For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
19½Ã 92:5 How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!
19½Ã 92:6 The dullard cannot know, the stupid cannot understand this:
19½Ã 92:7 though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever,
19½Ã 92:8 but you, O LORD, are on high forever.
19½Ã 92:9 For your enemies, O LORD, for your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
19½Ã 92:10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
19½Ã 92:11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
19½Ã 92:12 The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19½Ã 92:13 They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.
19½Ã 92:14 In old age they still produce fruit; they are always green and full of sap,
19½Ã 92:15 showing that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
19½Ã 93:1 The LORD is king, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed, he is girded with strength. He has established the world; it shall never be moved;
19½Ã 93:2 your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
19½Ã 93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
19½Ã 93:4 More majestic than the thunders of mighty waters, more majestic than the waves of the sea, majestic on high is the LORD!
19½Ã 93:5 Your decrees are very sure; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
19½Ã 94:1 O LORD, you God of vengeance, you God of vengeance, shine forth!
19½Ã 94:2 Rise up, O judge of the earth; give to the proud what they deserve!
19½Ã 94:3 O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
19½Ã 94:4 They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
19½Ã 94:5 They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.
19½Ã 94:6 They kill the widow and the stranger, they murder the orphan,
19½Ã 94:7 and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."
19½Ã 94:8 Understand, O dullest of the people; fools, when will you be wise?
19½Ã 94:9 He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
19½Ã 94:10 He who disciplines the nations, he who teaches knowledge to humankind, does he not chastise?
19½Ã 94:11 The LORD knows our thoughts, that they are but an empty breath.
19½Ã 94:12 Happy are those whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law,
19½Ã 94:13 giving them respite from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19½Ã 94:14 For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
19½Ã 94:15 for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19½Ã 94:16 Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
19½Ã 94:17 If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
19½Ã 94:18 When I thought, "My foot is slipping," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.
19½Ã 94:19 When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
19½Ã 94:20 Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who contrive mischief by statute?
19½Ã 94:21 They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn the innocent to death.
19½Ã 94:22 But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
19½Ã 94:23 He will repay them for their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
19½Ã 95:1 O come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
19½Ã 95:2 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
19½Ã 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
19½Ã 95:4 In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.
19½Ã 95:5 The sea is his, for he made it, and the dry land, which his hands have formed.
19½Ã 95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!
19½Ã 95:7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. O that today you would listen to his voice!
19½Ã 95:8 Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
19½Ã 95:9 when your ancestors tested me, and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.
19½Ã 95:10 For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they do not regard my ways."
19½Ã 95:11 Therefore in my anger I swore, "They shall not enter my rest."
19½Ã 96:1 O sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.
19½Ã 96:2 Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.
19½Ã 96:3 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
19½Ã 96:4 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be revered above all gods.
19½Ã 96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
19½Ã 96:6 Honor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
19½Ã 96:7 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
19½Ã 96:8 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts.
19½Ã 96:9 Worship the LORD in holy splendor; tremble before him, all the earth.
19½Ã 96:10 Say among the nations, "The LORD is king! The world is firmly established; it shall never be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity."
19½Ã 96:11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
19½Ã 96:12 let the field exult, and everything in it. Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
19½Ã 96:13 before the LORD; for he is coming, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.
19½Ã 97:1 The LORD is king! Let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!
19½Ã 97:2 Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19½Ã 97:3 Fire goes before him, and consumes his adversaries on every side.
19½Ã 97:4 His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
19½Ã 97:5 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
19½Ã 97:6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness; and all the peoples behold his glory.
19½Ã 97:7 All worshipers of images are put to shame, those who make their boast in worthless idols; all gods bow down before him.
19½Ã 97:8 Zion hears and is glad, and the towns of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O God.
19½Ã 97:9 For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
19½Ã 97:10 The LORD loves those who hate evil; he guards the lives of his faithful; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.
19½Ã 97:11 Light dawns for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
19½Ã 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!
19½Ã 98:1 A Psalm. O sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things. His right hand and his holy arm have gotten him victory.
19½Ã 98:2 The LORD has made known his victory; he has revealed his vindication in the sight of the nations.
19½Ã 98:3 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
19½Ã 98:4 Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises.
19½Ã 98:5 Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody.
19½Ã 98:6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD.
19½Ã 98:7 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who live in it.
19½Ã 98:8 Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing together for joy
19½Ã 98:9 at the presence of the LORD, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
19½Ã 99:1 The LORD is king; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!
19½Ã 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples.
19½Ã 99:3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. Holy is he!
19½Ã 99:4 Mighty King, lover of justice, you have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19½Ã 99:5 Extol the LORD our God; worship at his footstool. Holy is he!
19½Ã 99:6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They cried to the LORD, and he answered them.
19½Ã 99:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; they kept his decrees, and the statutes that he gave them.
19½Ã 99:8 O LORD our God, you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
19½Ã 99:9 Extol the LORD our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy.
19½Ã 100:1 A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.
19½Ã 100:2 Worship the LORD with gladness; come into his presence with singing.
19½Ã 100:3 Know that the LORD is God. It is he that made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
19½Ã 100:4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name.
19½Ã 100:5 For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
19½Ã 101:1 Of David. A Psalm. I will sing of loyalty and of justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing.
19½Ã 101:2 I will study the way that is blameless. When shall I attain it? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;
19½Ã 101:3 I will not set before my eyes anything that is base. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
19½Ã 101:4 Perverseness of heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.
19½Ã 101:5 One who secretly slanders a neighbor I will destroy. A haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not tolerate.
19½Ã 101:6 I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, so that they may live with me; whoever walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.
19½Ã 101:7 No one who practices deceit shall remain in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue in my presence.
19½Ã 101:8 Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
19½Ã 102:1 A prayer of one afflicted, when faint and pleading before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you.
19½Ã 102:2 Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call.
19½Ã 102:3 For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.
19½Ã 102:4 My heart is stricken and withered like grass; I am too wasted to eat my bread.
19½Ã 102:5 Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my skin.
19½Ã 102:6 I am like an owl of the wilderness, like a little owl of the waste places.
19½Ã 102:7 I lie awake; I am like a lonely bird on the housetop.
19½Ã 102:8 All day long my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.
19½Ã 102:9 For I eat ashes like bread, and mingle tears with my drink,
19½Ã 102:10 because of your indignation and anger; for you have lifted me up and thrown me aside.
19½Ã 102:11 My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
19½Ã 102:12 But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; your name endures to all generations.
19½Ã 102:13 You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to favor it; the appointed time has come.
19½Ã 102:14 For your servants hold its stones dear, and have pity on its dust.
19½Ã 102:15 The nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.
19½Ã 102:16 For the LORD will build up Zion; he will appear in his glory.
19½Ã 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and will not despise their prayer.
19½Ã 102:18 Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet unborn may praise the LORD:
19½Ã 102:19 that he looked down from his holy height, from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,
19½Ã 102:20 to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die;
19½Ã 102:21 so that the name of the LORD may be declared in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,
19½Ã 102:22 when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD.
19½Ã 102:23 He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.
19½Ã 102:24 "O my God," I say, "do not take me away at the mid-point of my life, you whose years endure throughout all generations."
19½Ã 102:25 Long ago you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19½Ã 102:26 They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a garment. You change them like clothing, and they pass away;
19½Ã 102:27 but you are the same, and your years have no end.
19½Ã 102:28 The children of your servants shall live secure; their offspring shall be established in your presence.
19½Ã 103:1 Of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
19½Ã 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all his benefits--
19½Ã 103:3 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,
19½Ã 103:4 who redeems your life from the Pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
19½Ã 103:5 who satisfies you with good as long as you live so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
19½Ã 103:6 The LORD works vindication and justice for all who are oppressed.
19½Ã 103:7 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.
19½Ã 103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
19½Ã 103:9 He will not always accuse, nor will he keep his anger forever.
19½Ã 103:10 He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
19½Ã 103:11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
19½Ã 103:12 as far as the east is from the west, so far he removes our transgressions from us.
19½Ã 103:13 As a father has compassion for his children, so the LORD has compassion for those who fear him.
19½Ã 103:14 For he knows how we were made; he remembers that we are dust.
19½Ã 103:15 As for mortals, their days are like grass; they flourish like a flower of the field;
19½Ã 103:16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.
19½Ã 103:17 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children,
19½Ã 103:18 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.
19½Ã 103:19 The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
19½Ã 103:20 Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, obedient to his spoken word.
19½Ã 103:21 Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will.
19½Ã 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul.
19½Ã 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty,
19½Ã 104:2 wrapped in light as with a garment. You stretch out the heavens like a tent,
19½Ã 104:3 you set the beams of your chambers on the waters, you make the clouds your chariot, you ride on the wings of the wind,
19½Ã 104:4 you make the winds your messengers, fire and flame your ministers.
19½Ã 104:5 You set the earth on its foundations, so that it shall never be shaken.
19½Ã 104:6 You cover it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19½Ã 104:7 At your rebuke they flee; at the sound of your thunder they take to flight.
19½Ã 104:8 They rose up to the mountains, ran down to the valleys to the place that you appointed for them.
19½Ã 104:9 You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.
19½Ã 104:10 You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills,
19½Ã 104:11 giving drink to every wild animal; the wild asses quench their thirst.
19½Ã 104:12 By the streams the birds of the air have their habitation; they sing among the branches.
19½Ã 104:13 From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.
19½Ã 104:14 You cause the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for people to use, to bring forth food from the earth,
19½Ã 104:15 and wine to gladden the human heart, oil to make the face shine, and bread to strengthen the human heart.
19½Ã 104:16 The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
19½Ã 104:17 In them the birds build their nests; the stork has its home in the fir trees.
19½Ã 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the coneys.
19½Ã 104:19 You have made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.
19½Ã 104:20 You make darkness, and it is night, when all the animals of the forest come creeping out.
19½Ã 104:21 The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
19½Ã 104:22 When the sun rises, they withdraw and lie down in their dens.
19½Ã 104:23 People go out to their work and to their labor until the evening.
19½Ã 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19½Ã 104:25 Yonder is the sea, great and wide, creeping things innumerable are there, living things both small and great.
19½Ã 104:26 There go the ships, and Leviathan that you formed to sport in it.
19½Ã 104:27 These all look to you to give them their food in due season;
19½Ã 104:28 when you give to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
19½Ã 104:29 When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
19½Ã 104:30 When you send forth your spirit, they are created; and you renew the face of the ground.
19½Ã 104:31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--
19½Ã 104:32 who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke.
19½Ã 104:33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
19½Ã 104:34 May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.
19½Ã 104:35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 105:1 O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples.
19½Ã 105:2 Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wonderful works.
19½Ã 105:3 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
19½Ã 105:4 Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually.
19½Ã 105:5 Remember the wonderful works he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
19½Ã 105:6 O offspring of his servant Abraham, children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
19½Ã 105:7 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
19½Ã 105:8 He is mindful of his covenant forever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
19½Ã 105:9 the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
19½Ã 105:10 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
19½Ã 105:11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."
19½Ã 105:12 When they were few in number, of little account, and strangers in it,
19½Ã 105:13 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
19½Ã 105:14 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
19½Ã 105:15 saying, "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
19½Ã 105:16 When he summoned famine against the land, and broke every staff of bread,
19½Ã 105:17 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19½Ã 105:18 His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron;
19½Ã 105:19 until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD kept testing him.
19½Ã 105:20 The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free.
19½Ã 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,
19½Ã 105:22 to instruct his officials at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
19½Ã 105:23 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.
19½Ã 105:24 And the LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes,
19½Ã 105:25 whose hearts he then turned to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
19½Ã 105:26 He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
19½Ã 105:27 They performed his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.
19½Ã 105:28 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled against his words.
19½Ã 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.
19½Ã 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
19½Ã 105:31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19½Ã 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land.
19½Ã 105:33 He struck their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
19½Ã 105:34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number;
19½Ã 105:35 they devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.
19½Ã 105:36 He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the first issue of all their strength.
19½Ã 105:37 Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold, and there was no one among their tribes who stumbled.
19½Ã 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
19½Ã 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
19½Ã 105:40 They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them food from heaven in abundance.
19½Ã 105:41 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.
19½Ã 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.
19½Ã 105:43 So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
19½Ã 105:44 He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the wealth of the peoples,
19½Ã 105:45 that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 106:1 Praise the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 106:2 Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or declare all his praise?
19½Ã 106:3 Happy are those who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times.
19½Ã 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you deliver them;
19½Ã 106:5 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory in your heritage.
19½Ã 106:6 Both we and our ancestors have sinned; we have committed iniquity, have done wickedly.
19½Ã 106:7 Our ancestors, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.
19½Ã 106:8 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, so that he might make known his mighty power.
19½Ã 106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; he led them through the deep as through a desert.
19½Ã 106:10 So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.
19½Ã 106:11 The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
19½Ã 106:12 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
19½Ã 106:13 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
19½Ã 106:14 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
19½Ã 106:15 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
19½Ã 106:16 They were jealous of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
19½Ã 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the faction of Abiram.
19½Ã 106:18 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
19½Ã 106:19 They made a calf at Horeb and worshiped a cast image.
19½Ã 106:20 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
19½Ã 106:21 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
19½Ã 106:22 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
19½Ã 106:23 Therefore he said he would destroy them--had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
19½Ã 106:24 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
19½Ã 106:25 They grumbled in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.
19½Ã 106:26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
19½Ã 106:27 and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands.
19½Ã 106:28 Then they attached themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
19½Ã 106:29 they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
19½Ã 106:30 Then Phinehas stood up and interceded, and the plague was stopped.
19½Ã 106:31 And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.
19½Ã 106:32 They angered the LORD at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;
19½Ã 106:33 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash.
19½Ã 106:34 They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,
19½Ã 106:35 but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did.
19½Ã 106:36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
19½Ã 106:37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
19½Ã 106:38 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.
19½Ã 106:39 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and prostituted themselves in their doings.
19½Ã 106:40 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
19½Ã 106:41 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
19½Ã 106:42 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
19½Ã 106:43 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity.
19½Ã 106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry.
19½Ã 106:45 For their sake he remembered his covenant, and showed compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
19½Ã 106:46 He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.
19½Ã 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
19½Ã 106:48 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 107:1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, those he redeemed from trouble
19½Ã 107:3 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
19½Ã 107:4 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to an inhabited town;
19½Ã 107:5 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
19½Ã 107:6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;
19½Ã 107:7 he led them by a straight way, until they reached an inhabited town.
19½Ã 107:8 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to humankind.
19½Ã 107:9 For he satisfies the thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things.
19½Ã 107:10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in misery and in irons,
19½Ã 107:11 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
19½Ã 107:12 Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor; they fell down, with no one to help.
19½Ã 107:13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress;
19½Ã 107:14 he brought them out of darkness and gloom, and broke their bonds asunder.
19½Ã 107:15 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to humankind.
19½Ã 107:16 For he shatters the doors of bronze, and cuts in two the bars of iron.
19½Ã 107:17 Some were sick through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities endured affliction;
19½Ã 107:18 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.
19½Ã 107:19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress;
19½Ã 107:20 he sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from destruction.
19½Ã 107:21 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to humankind.
19½Ã 107:22 And let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices, and tell of his deeds with songs of joy.
19½Ã 107:23 Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the mighty waters;
19½Ã 107:24 they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.
19½Ã 107:25 For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.
19½Ã 107:26 They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their calamity;
19½Ã 107:27 they reeled and staggered like drunkards, and were at their wits' end.
19½Ã 107:28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out from their distress;
19½Ã 107:29 he made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
19½Ã 107:30 Then they were glad because they had quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.
19½Ã 107:31 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to humankind.
19½Ã 107:32 Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
19½Ã 107:33 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
19½Ã 107:34 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
19½Ã 107:35 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.
19½Ã 107:36 And there he lets the hungry live, and they establish a town to live in;
19½Ã 107:37 they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get a fruitful yield.
19½Ã 107:38 By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their cattle decrease.
19½Ã 107:39 When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
19½Ã 107:40 he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
19½Ã 107:41 but he raises up the needy out of distress, and makes their families like flocks.
19½Ã 107:42 The upright see it and are glad; and all wickedness stops its mouth.
19½Ã 107:43 Let those who are wise give heed to these things, and consider the steadfast love of the LORD.
19½Ã 108:1 A Song. A Psalm of David. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make melody. Awake, my soul!
19½Ã 108:2 Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn.
19½Ã 108:3 I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to you among the nations.
19½Ã 108:4 For your steadfast love is higher than the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
19½Ã 108:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. and let your glory be over all the earth.
19½Ã 108:6 Give victory with your right hand, and answer me, so that those whom you love may be rescued.
19½Ã 108:7 God has promised in his sanctuary: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
19½Ã 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
19½Ã 108:9 Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I hurl my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19½Ã 108:10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19½Ã 108:11 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.
19½Ã 108:12 O grant us help against the foe, for human help is worthless.
19½Ã 108:13 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
19½Ã 109:1 To the leader. Of David. A Psalm. Do not be silent, O God of my praise.
19½Ã 109:2 For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.
19½Ã 109:3 They beset me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.
19½Ã 109:4 In return for my love they accuse me, even while I make prayer for them.
19½Ã 109:5 So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
19½Ã 109:6 They say, "Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand on his right.
19½Ã 109:7 When he is tried, let him be found guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin.
19½Ã 109:8 May his days be few; may another seize his position.
19½Ã 109:9 May his children be orphans, and his wife a widow.
19½Ã 109:10 May his children wander about and beg; may they be driven out of the ruins they inhabit.
19½Ã 109:11 May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.
19½Ã 109:12 May there be no one to do him a kindness, nor anyone to pity his orphaned children.
19½Ã 109:13 May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation.
19½Ã 109:14 May the iniquity of his father be remembered before the LORD, and do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
19½Ã 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, and may his memory be cut off from the earth.
19½Ã 109:16 For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted to their death.
19½Ã 109:17 He loved to curse; let curses come on him. He did not like blessing; may it be far from him.
19½Ã 109:18 He clothed himself with cursing as his coat, may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones.
19½Ã 109:19 May it be like a garment that he wraps around himself, like a belt that he wears every day."
19½Ã 109:20 May that be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life.
19½Ã 109:21 But you, O LORD my Lord, act on my behalf for your name's sake; because your steadfast love is good, deliver me.
19½Ã 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is pierced within me.
19½Ã 109:23 I am gone like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.
19½Ã 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt.
19½Ã 109:25 I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.
19½Ã 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to your steadfast love.
19½Ã 109:27 Let them know that this is your hand; you, O LORD, have done it.
19½Ã 109:28 Let them curse, but you will bless. Let my assailants be put to shame; may your servant be glad.
19½Ã 109:29 May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle.
19½Ã 109:30 With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
19½Ã 109:31 For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save them from those who would condemn them to death.
19½Ã 110:1 Of David. A Psalm. The LORD says to my lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."
19½Ã 110:2 The LORD sends out from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your foes.
19½Ã 110:3 Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day you lead your forces on the holy mountains. From the womb of the morning, like dew, your youth will come to you.
19½Ã 110:4 The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
19½Ã 110:5 The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.
19½Ã 110:6 He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter heads over the wide earth.
19½Ã 110:7 He will drink from the stream by the path; therefore he will lift up his head.
19½Ã 111:1 Praise the LORD! I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, in the company of the upright, in the congregation.
19½Ã 111:2 Great are the works of the LORD, studied by all who delight in them.
19½Ã 111:3 Full of honor and majesty is his work, and his righteousness endures forever.
19½Ã 111:4 He has gained renown by his wonderful deeds; the LORD is gracious and merciful.
19½Ã 111:5 He provides food for those who fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.
19½Ã 111:6 He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.
19½Ã 111:7 The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.
19½Ã 111:8 They are established forever and ever, to be performed with faithfulness and uprightness.
19½Ã 111:9 He sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and awesome is his name.
19½Ã 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.
19½Ã 112:1 Praise the LORD! Happy are those who fear the LORD, who greatly delight in his commandments.
19½Ã 112:2 Their descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
19½Ã 112:3 Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.
19½Ã 112:4 They rise in the darkness as a light for the upright; they are gracious, merciful, and righteous.
19½Ã 112:5 It is well with those who deal generously and lend, who conduct their affairs with justice.
19½Ã 112:6 For the righteous will never be moved; they will be remembered forever.
19½Ã 112:7 They are not afraid of evil tidings; their hearts are firm, secure in the LORD.
19½Ã 112:8 Their hearts are steady, they will not be afraid; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.
19½Ã 112:9 They have distributed freely, they have given to the poor; their righteousness endures forever; their horn is exalted in honor.
19½Ã 112:10 The wicked see it and are angry; they gnash their teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked comes to nothing.
19½Ã 113:1 Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time on and forevermore.
19½Ã 113:3 From the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the LORD is to be praised.
19½Ã 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
19½Ã 113:5 Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high,
19½Ã 113:6 who looks far down on the heavens and the earth?
19½Ã 113:7 He raises the poor from the dust, and lifts the needy from the ash heap,
19½Ã 113:8 to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people.
19½Ã 113:9 He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 114:1 When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
19½Ã 114:2 Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
19½Ã 114:3 The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back.
19½Ã 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
19½Ã 114:5 Why is it, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
19½Ã 114:6 O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
19½Ã 114:7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
19½Ã 114:8 who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
19½Ã 115:1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness.
19½Ã 115:2 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"
19½Ã 115:3 Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases.
19½Ã 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
19½Ã 115:5 They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.
19½Ã 115:6 They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.
19½Ã 115:7 They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; they make no sound in their throats.
19½Ã 115:8 Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them.
19½Ã 115:9 O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:11 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:12 The LORD has been mindful of us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron;
19½Ã 115:13 he will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great.
19½Ã 115:14 May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.
19½Ã 115:15 May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 115:16 The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth he has given to human beings.
19½Ã 115:17 The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any that go down into silence.
19½Ã 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time on and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 116:1 I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my supplications.
19½Ã 116:2 Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
19½Ã 116:3 The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.
19½Ã 116:4 Then I called on the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I pray, save my life!"
19½Ã 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful.
19½Ã 116:6 The LORD protects the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me.
19½Ã 116:7 Return, O my soul, to your rest, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.
19½Ã 116:8 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
19½Ã 116:9 I walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
19½Ã 116:10 I kept my faith, even when I said, "I am greatly afflicted";
19½Ã 116:11 I said in my consternation, "Everyone is a liar."
19½Ã 116:12 What shall I return to the LORD for all his bounty to me?
19½Ã 116:13 I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD,
19½Ã 116:14 I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.
19½Ã 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his faithful ones.
19½Ã 116:16 O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the child of your serving girl. You have loosed my bonds.
19½Ã 116:17 I will offer to you a thanksgiving sacrifice and call on the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 116:18 I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people,
19½Ã 116:19 in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 117:1 Praise the LORD, all you nations! Extol him, all you peoples!
19½Ã 117:2 For great is his steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 118:1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his steadfast love endures forever!
19½Ã 118:2 Let Israel say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
19½Ã 118:3 Let the house of Aaron say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
19½Ã 118:4 Let those who fear the LORD say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
19½Ã 118:5 Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place.
19½Ã 118:6 With the LORD on my side I do not fear. What can mortals do to me?
19½Ã 118:7 The LORD is on my side to help me; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.
19½Ã 118:8 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to put confidence in mortals.
19½Ã 118:9 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
19½Ã 118:10 All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!
19½Ã 118:11 They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!
19½Ã 118:12 They surrounded me like bees; they blazed like a fire of thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!
19½Ã 118:13 I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me.
19½Ã 118:14 The LORD is my strength and my might; he has become my salvation.
19½Ã 118:15 There are glad songs of victory in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD does valiantly;
19½Ã 118:16 the right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD does valiantly."
19½Ã 118:17 I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD.
19½Ã 118:18 The LORD has punished me severely, but he did not give me over to death.
19½Ã 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD.
19½Ã 118:20 This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.
19½Ã 118:21 I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation.
19½Ã 118:22 The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.
19½Ã 118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.
19½Ã 118:24 This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
19½Ã 118:25 Save us, we beseech you, O LORD! O LORD, we beseech you, give us success!
19½Ã 118:26 Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the LORD. We bless you from the house of the LORD.
19½Ã 118:27 The LORD is God, and he has given us light. Bind the festal procession with branches, up to the horns of the altar.
19½Ã 118:28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; you are my God, I will extol you.
19½Ã 118:29 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 119:1 Happy are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the LORD.
19½Ã 119:2 Happy are those who keep his decrees, who seek him with their whole heart,
19½Ã 119:3 who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways.
19½Ã 119:4 You have commanded your precepts to be kept diligently.
19½Ã 119:5 O that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes!
19½Ã 119:6 Then I shall not be put to shame, having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.
19½Ã 119:7 I will praise you with an upright heart, when I learn your righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:8 I will observe your statutes; do not utterly forsake me.
19½Ã 119:9 How can young people keep their way pure? By guarding it according to your word.
19½Ã 119:10 With my whole heart I seek you; do not let me stray from your commandments.
19½Ã 119:11 I treasure your word in my heart, so that I may not sin against you.
19½Ã 119:12 Blessed are you, O LORD; teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:13 With my lips I declare all the ordinances of your mouth.
19½Ã 119:14 I delight in the way of your decrees as much as in all riches.
19½Ã 119:15 I will meditate on your precepts, and fix my eyes on your ways.
19½Ã 119:16 I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.
19½Ã 119:17 Deal bountifully with your servant, so that I may live and observe your word.
19½Ã 119:18 Open my eyes, so that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.
19½Ã 119:19 I live as an alien in the land; do not hide your commandments from me.
19½Ã 119:20 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
19½Ã 119:21 You rebuke the insolent, accursed ones, who wander from your commandments;
19½Ã 119:22 take away from me their scorn and contempt, for I have kept your decrees.
19½Ã 119:23 Even though princes sit plotting against me, your servant will meditate on your statutes.
19½Ã 119:24 Your decrees are my delight, they are my counselors.
19½Ã 119:25 My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to your word.
19½Ã 119:26 When I told of my ways, you answered me; teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:27 Make me understand the way of your precepts, and I will meditate on your wondrous works.
19½Ã 119:28 My soul melts away for sorrow; strengthen me according to your word.
19½Ã 119:29 Put false ways far from me; and graciously teach me your law.
19½Ã 119:30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness; I set your ordinances before me.
19½Ã 119:31 I cling to your decrees, O LORD; let me not be put to shame.
19½Ã 119:32 I run the way of your commandments, for you enlarge my understanding.
19½Ã 119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes, and I will observe it to the end.
19½Ã 119:34 Give me understanding, that I may keep your law and observe it with my whole heart.
19½Ã 119:35 Lead me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in it.
19½Ã 119:36 Turn my heart to your decrees, and not to selfish gain.
19½Ã 119:37 Turn my eyes from looking at vanities; give me life in your ways.
19½Ã 119:38 Confirm to your servant your promise, which is for those who fear you.
19½Ã 119:39 Turn away the disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
19½Ã 119:40 See, I have longed for your precepts; in your righteousness give me life.
19½Ã 119:41 Let your steadfast love come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise.
19½Ã 119:42 Then I shall have an answer for those who taunt me, for I trust in your word.
19½Ã 119:43 Do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for my hope is in your ordinances.
19½Ã 119:44 I will keep your law continually, forever and ever.
19½Ã 119:45 I shall walk at liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
19½Ã 119:46 I will also speak of your decrees before kings, and shall not be put to shame;
19½Ã 119:47 I find my delight in your commandments, because I love them.
19½Ã 119:48 I revere your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on your statutes.
19½Ã 119:49 Remember your word to your servant, in which you have made me hope.
19½Ã 119:50 This is my comfort in my distress, that your promise gives me life.
19½Ã 119:51 The arrogant utterly deride me, but I do not turn away from your law.
19½Ã 119:52 When I think of your ordinances from of old, I take comfort, O LORD.
19½Ã 119:53 Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked, those who forsake your law.
19½Ã 119:54 Your statutes have been my songs wherever I make my home.
19½Ã 119:55 I remember your name in the night, O LORD, and keep your law.
19½Ã 119:56 This blessing has fallen to me, for I have kept your precepts.
19½Ã 119:57 The LORD is my portion; I promise to keep your words.
19½Ã 119:58 I implore your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise.
19½Ã 119:59 When I think of your ways, I turn my feet to your decrees;
19½Ã 119:60 I hurry and do not delay to keep your commandments.
19½Ã 119:61 Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me, I do not forget your law.
19½Ã 119:62 At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:63 I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts.
19½Ã 119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love; teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:65 You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word.
19½Ã 119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments.
19½Ã 119:67 Before I was humbled I went astray, but now I keep your word.
19½Ã 119:68 You are good and do good; teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:69 The arrogant smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts.
19½Ã 119:70 Their hearts are fat and gross, but I delight in your law.
19½Ã 119:71 It is good for me that I was humbled, so that I might learn your statutes.
19½Ã 119:72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
19½Ã 119:73 Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.
19½Ã 119:74 Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice, because I have hoped in your word.
19½Ã 119:75 I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right, and that in faithfulness you have humbled me.
19½Ã 119:76 Let your steadfast love become my comfort according to your promise to your servant.
19½Ã 119:77 Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight.
19½Ã 119:78 Let the arrogant be put to shame, because they have subverted me with guile; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.
19½Ã 119:79 Let those who fear you turn to me, so that they may know your decrees.
19½Ã 119:80 May my heart be blameless in your statutes, so that I may not be put to shame.
19½Ã 119:81 My soul languishes for your salvation; I hope in your word.
19½Ã 119:82 My eyes fail with watching for your promise; I ask, "When will you comfort me?"
19½Ã 119:83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes.
19½Ã 119:84 How long must your servant endure? When will you judge those who persecute me?
19½Ã 119:85 The arrogant have dug pitfalls for me; they flout your law.
19½Ã 119:86 All your commandments are enduring; I am persecuted without cause; help me!
19½Ã 119:87 They have almost made an end of me on earth; but I have not forsaken your precepts.
19½Ã 119:88 In your steadfast love spare my life, so that I may keep the decrees of your mouth.
19½Ã 119:89 The LORD exists forever; your word is firmly fixed in heaven.
19½Ã 119:90 Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.
19½Ã 119:91 By your appointment they stand today, for all things are your servants.
19½Ã 119:92 If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my misery.
19½Ã 119:93 I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.
19½Ã 119:94 I am yours; save me, for I have sought your precepts.
19½Ã 119:95 The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider your decrees.
19½Ã 119:96 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad.
19½Ã 119:97 Oh, how I love your law! It is my meditation all day long.
19½Ã 119:98 Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is always with me.
19½Ã 119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your decrees are my meditation.
19½Ã 119:100 I understand more than the aged, for I keep your precepts.
19½Ã 119:101 I hold back my feet from every evil way, in order to keep your word.
19½Ã 119:102 I do not turn away from your ordinances, for you have taught me.
19½Ã 119:103 How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
19½Ã 119:104 Through your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way.
19½Ã 119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
19½Ã 119:106 I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, to observe your righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:107 I am severely afflicted; give me life, O LORD, according to your word.
19½Ã 119:108 Accept my offerings of praise, O LORD, and teach me your ordinances.
19½Ã 119:109 I hold my life in my hand continually, but I do not forget your law.
19½Ã 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, but I do not stray from your precepts.
19½Ã 119:111 Your decrees are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart.
19½Ã 119:112 I incline my heart to perform your statutes forever, to the end.
19½Ã 119:113 I hate the double-minded, but I love your law.
19½Ã 119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in your word.
19½Ã 119:115 Go away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God.
19½Ã 119:116 Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live, and let me not be put to shame in my hope.
19½Ã 119:117 Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for your statutes continually.
19½Ã 119:118 You spurn all who go astray from your statutes; for their cunning is in vain.
19½Ã 119:119 All the wicked of the earth you count as dross; therefore I love your decrees.
19½Ã 119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments.
19½Ã 119:121 I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.
19½Ã 119:122 Guarantee your servant's well-being; do not let the godless oppress me.
19½Ã 119:123 My eyes fail from watching for your salvation, and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.
19½Ã 119:124 Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love, and teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:125 I am your servant; give me understanding, so that I may know your decrees.
19½Ã 119:126 It is time for the LORD to act, for your law has been broken.
19½Ã 119:127 Truly I love your commandments more than gold, more than fine gold.
19½Ã 119:128 Truly I direct my steps by all your precepts; I hate every false way.
19½Ã 119:129 Your decrees are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them.
19½Ã 119:130 The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.
19½Ã 119:131 With open mouth I pant, because I long for your commandments.
19½Ã 119:132 Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is your custom toward those who love your name.
19½Ã 119:133 Keep my steps steady according to your promise, and never let iniquity have dominion over me.
19½Ã 119:134 Redeem me from human oppression, that I may keep your precepts.
19½Ã 119:135 Make your face shine upon your servant, and teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:136 My eyes shed streams of tears because your law is not kept.
19½Ã 119:137 You are righteous, O LORD, and your judgments are right.
19½Ã 119:138 You have appointed your decrees in righteousness and in all faithfulness.
19½Ã 119:139 My zeal consumes me because my foes forget your words.
19½Ã 119:140 Your promise is well tried, and your servant loves it.
19½Ã 119:141 I am small and despised, yet I do not forget your precepts.
19½Ã 119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and your law is the truth.
19½Ã 119:143 Trouble and anguish have come upon me, but your commandments are my delight.
19½Ã 119:144 Your decrees are righteous forever; give me understanding that I may live.
19½Ã 119:145 With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O LORD. I will keep your statutes.
19½Ã 119:146 I cry to you; save me, that I may observe your decrees.
19½Ã 119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help; I put my hope in your words.
19½Ã 119:148 My eyes are awake before each watch of the night, that I may meditate on your promise.
19½Ã 119:149 In your steadfast love hear my voice; O LORD, in your justice preserve my life.
19½Ã 119:150 Those who persecute me with evil purpose draw near; they are far from your law.
19½Ã 119:151 Yet you are near, O LORD, and all your commandments are true.
19½Ã 119:152 Long ago I learned from your decrees that you have established them forever.
19½Ã 119:153 Look on my misery and rescue me, for I do not forget your law.
19½Ã 119:154 Plead my cause and redeem me; give me life according to your promise.
19½Ã 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek your statutes.
19½Ã 119:156 Great is your mercy, O LORD; give me life according to your justice.
19½Ã 119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, yet I do not swerve from your decrees.
19½Ã 119:158 I look at the faithless with disgust, because they do not keep your commands.
19½Ã 119:159 Consider how I love your precepts; preserve my life according to your steadfast love.
19½Ã 119:160 The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever.
19½Ã 119:161 Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words.
19½Ã 119:162 I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil.
19½Ã 119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood, but I love your law.
19½Ã 119:164 Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:165 Great peace have those who love your law; nothing can make them stumble.
19½Ã 119:166 I hope for your salvation, O LORD, and I fulfill your commandments.
19½Ã 119:167 My soul keeps your decrees; I love them exceedingly.
19½Ã 119:168 I keep your precepts and decrees, for all my ways are before you.
19½Ã 119:169 Let my cry come before you, O LORD; give me understanding according to your word.
19½Ã 119:170 Let my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise.
19½Ã 119:171 My lips will pour forth praise, because you teach me your statutes.
19½Ã 119:172 My tongue will sing of your promise, for all your commandments are right.
19½Ã 119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
19½Ã 119:174 I long for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight.
19½Ã 119:175 Let me live that I may praise you, and let your ordinances help me.
19½Ã 119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek out your servant, for I do not forget your commandments.
19½Ã 120:1 A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cry to the LORD, that he may answer me:
19½Ã 120:2 "Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue."
19½Ã 120:3 What shall be given to you? And what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?
19½Ã 120:4 A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree!
19½Ã 120:5 Woe is me, that I am an alien in Meshech, that I must live among the tents of Kedar.
19½Ã 120:6 Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace.
19½Ã 120:7 I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
19½Ã 121:1 A Song of Ascents. I lift up my eyes to the hills--from where will my help come?
19½Ã 121:2 My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 121:3 He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber.
19½Ã 121:4 He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
19½Ã 121:5 The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade at your right hand.
19½Ã 121:6 The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
19½Ã 121:7 The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life.
19½Ã 121:8 The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time on and forevermore.
19½Ã 122:1 A Song of Ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD!"
19½Ã 122:2 Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.
19½Ã 122:3 Jerusalem--built as a city that is bound firmly together.
19½Ã 122:4 To it the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 122:5 For there the thrones for judgment were set up, the thrones of the house of David.
19½Ã 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you.
19½Ã 122:7 Peace be within your walls, and security within your towers."
19½Ã 122:8 For the sake of my relatives and friends I will say, "Peace be within you."
19½Ã 122:9 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.
19½Ã 123:1 A Song of Ascents. To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!
19½Ã 123:2 As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, until he has mercy upon us.
19½Ã 123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt.
19½Ã 123:4 Our soul has had more than its fill of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.
19½Ã 124:1 A Song of Ascents. Of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side--let Israel now say--
19½Ã 124:2 if it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when our enemies attacked us,
19½Ã 124:3 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;
19½Ã 124:4 then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;
19½Ã 124:5 then over us would have gone the raging waters.
19½Ã 124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
19½Ã 124:7 We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
19½Ã 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 125:1 A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
19½Ã 125:2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time on and forevermore.
19½Ã 125:3 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous might not stretch out their hands to do wrong.
19½Ã 125:4 Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts.
19½Ã 125:5 But those who turn aside to their own crooked ways the LORD will lead away with evildoers. Peace be upon Israel!
19½Ã 126:1 A Song of Ascents. When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
19½Ã 126:2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."
19½Ã 126:3 The LORD has done great things for us, and we rejoiced.
19½Ã 126:4 Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like the watercourses in the Negeb.
19½Ã 126:5 May those who sow in tears reap with shouts of joy.
19½Ã 126:6 Those who go out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, carrying their sheaves.
19½Ã 127:1 A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain.
19½Ã 127:2 It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives sleep to his beloved.
19½Ã 127:3 Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward.
19½Ã 127:4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons of one's youth.
19½Ã 127:5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
19½Ã 128:1 A Song of Ascents. Happy is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways.
19½Ã 128:2 You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be happy, and it shall go well with you.
19½Ã 128:3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.
19½Ã 128:4 Thus shall the man be blessed who fears the LORD.
19½Ã 128:5 The LORD bless you from Zion. May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
19½Ã 128:6 May you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
19½Ã 129:1 A Song of Ascents. "Often have they attacked me from my youth" --let Israel now say--
19½Ã 129:2 "often have they attacked me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
19½Ã 129:3 The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long."
19½Ã 129:4 The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked.
19½Ã 129:5 May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward.
19½Ã 129:6 Let them be like the grass on the housetops that withers before it grows up,
19½Ã 129:7 with which reapers do not fill their hands or binders of sheaves their arms,
19½Ã 129:8 while those who pass by do not say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"
19½Ã 130:1 A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD.
19½Ã 130:2 Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications!
19½Ã 130:3 If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?
19½Ã 130:4 But there is forgiveness with you, so that you may be revered.
19½Ã 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;
19½Ã 130:6 my soul waits for the Lord more than those who watch for the morning, more than those who watch for the morning.
19½Ã 130:7 O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is great power to redeem.
19½Ã 130:8 It is he who will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
19½Ã 131:1 A Song of Ascents. Of David. O LORD, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
19½Ã 131:2 But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.
19½Ã 131:3 O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time on and forevermore.
19½Ã 132:1 A Song of Ascents. O LORD, remember in David's favor all the hardships he endured;
19½Ã 132:2 how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
19½Ã 132:3 "I will not enter my house or get into my bed;
19½Ã 132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
19½Ã 132:5 until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."
19½Ã 132:6 We heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
19½Ã 132:7 "Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool."
19½Ã 132:8 Rise up, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
19½Ã 132:9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your faithful shout for joy.
19½Ã 132:10 For your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of your anointed one.
19½Ã 132:11 The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.
19½Ã 132:12 If your sons keep my covenant and my decrees that I shall teach them, their sons also, forevermore, shall sit on your throne."
19½Ã 132:13 For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation:
19½Ã 132:14 "This is my resting place forever; here I will reside, for I have desired it.
19½Ã 132:15 I will abundantly bless its provisions; I will satisfy its poor with bread.
19½Ã 132:16 Its priests I will clothe with salvation, and its faithful will shout for joy.
19½Ã 132:17 There I will cause a horn to sprout up for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.
19½Ã 132:18 His enemies I will clothe with disgrace, but on him, his crown will gleam."
19½Ã 133:1 A Song of Ascents. How very good and pleasant it is when kindred live together in unity!
19½Ã 133:2 It is like the precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down over the collar of his robes.
19½Ã 133:3 It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD ordained his blessing, life forevermore.
19½Ã 134:1 A Song of Ascents. Come, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, who stand by night in the house of the LORD!
19½Ã 134:2 Lift up your hands to the holy place, and bless the LORD.
19½Ã 134:3 May the LORD, maker of heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
19½Ã 135:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD; give praise, O servants of the LORD,
19½Ã 135:2 you that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
19½Ã 135:3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing to his name, for he is gracious.
19½Ã 135:4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession.
19½Ã 135:5 For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.
19½Ã 135:6 Whatever the LORD pleases he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
19½Ã 135:7 He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
19½Ã 135:8 He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both human beings and animals;
19½Ã 135:9 he sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
19½Ã 135:10 He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings--
19½Ã 135:11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan--
19½Ã 135:12 and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.
19½Ã 135:13 Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, throughout all ages.
19½Ã 135:14 For the LORD will vindicate his people, and have compassion on his servants.
19½Ã 135:15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
19½Ã 135:16 They have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;
19½Ã 135:17 they have ears, but they do not hear, and there is no breath in their mouths.
19½Ã 135:18 Those who make them and all who trust them shall become like them.
19½Ã 135:19 O house of Israel, bless the LORD! O house of Aaron, bless the LORD!
19½Ã 135:20 O house of Levi, bless the LORD! You that fear the LORD, bless the LORD!
19½Ã 135:21 Blessed be the LORD from Zion, he who resides in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 136:1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 136:2 O give thanks to the God of gods, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:4 who alone does great wonders, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:5 who by understanding made the heavens, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:6 who spread out the earth on the waters, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:7 who made the great lights, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:8 the sun to rule over the day, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:9 the moon and stars to rule over the night, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:10 who struck Egypt through their firstborn, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:11 and brought Israel out from among them, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:12 with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:13 who divided the Red Sea in two, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:14 and made Israel pass through the midst of it, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:15 but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:16 who led his people through the wilderness, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:17 who struck down great kings, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:18 and killed famous kings, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:19 Sihon, king of the Amorites, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:20 and Og, king of Bashan, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:21 and gave their land as a heritage, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:22 a heritage to his servant Israel, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 136:23 It is he who remembered us in our low estate, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:24 and rescued us from our foes, for his steadfast love endures forever;
19½Ã 136:25 who gives food to all flesh, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 136:26 O give thanks to the God of heaven, for his steadfast love endures forever.
19½Ã 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon--there we sat down and there we wept when we remembered Zion.
19½Ã 137:2 On the willows there we hung up our harps.
19½Ã 137:3 For there our captors asked us for songs, and our tormentors asked for mirth, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"
19½Ã 137:4 How could we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?
19½Ã 137:5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither!
19½Ã 137:6 Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy.
19½Ã 137:7 Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem's fall, how they said, "Tear it down! Tear it down! Down to its foundations!"
19½Ã 137:8 O daughter Babylon, you devastator! Happy shall they be who pay you back what you have done to us!
19½Ã 137:9 Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!
19½Ã 138:1 Of David. I give you thanks, O LORD, with my whole heart; before the gods I sing your praise;
19½Ã 138:2 I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness; for you have exalted your name and your word above everything.
19½Ã 138:3 On the day I called, you answered me, you increased my strength of soul.
19½Ã 138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, for they have heard the words of your mouth.
19½Ã 138:5 They shall sing of the ways of the LORD, for great is the glory of the LORD.
19½Ã 138:6 For though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly; but the haughty he perceives from far away.
19½Ã 138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me against the wrath of my enemies; you stretch out your hand, and your right hand delivers me.
19½Ã 138:8 The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me; your steadfast love, O LORD, endures forever. Do not forsake the work of your hands.
19½Ã 139:1 To the leader. Of David. A Psalm. O LORD, you have searched me and known me.
19½Ã 139:2 You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from far away.
19½Ã 139:3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
19½Ã 139:4 Even before a word is on my tongue, O LORD, you know it completely.
19½Ã 139:5 You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.
19½Ã 139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is so high that I cannot attain it.
19½Ã 139:7 Where can I go from your spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence?
19½Ã 139:8 If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.
19½Ã 139:9 If I take the wings of the morning and settle at the farthest limits of the sea,
19½Ã 139:10 even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me fast.
19½Ã 139:11 If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light around me become night,"
19½Ã 139:12 even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is as bright as the day, for darkness is as light to you.
19½Ã 139:13 For it was you who formed my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother's womb.
19½Ã 139:14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; that I know very well.
19½Ã 139:15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
19½Ã 139:16 Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed.
19½Ã 139:17 How weighty to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
19½Ã 139:18 I try to count them--they are more than the sand; I come to the end--I am still with you.
19½Ã 139:19 O that you would kill the wicked, O God, and that the bloodthirsty would depart from me--
19½Ã 139:20 those who speak of you maliciously, and lift themselves up against you for evil!
19½Ã 139:21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
19½Ã 139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.
19½Ã 139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts.
19½Ã 139:24 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
19½Ã 140:1 To the leader. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from evildoers; protect me from those who are violent,
19½Ã 140:2 who plan evil things in their minds and stir up wars continually.
19½Ã 140:3 They make their tongue sharp as a snake's, and under their lips is the venom of vipers. Selah
19½Ã 140:4 Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent who have planned my downfall.
19½Ã 140:5 The arrogant have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net, along the road they have set snares for me. Selah
19½Ã 140:6 I say to the LORD, "You are my God; give ear, O LORD, to the voice of my supplications."
19½Ã 140:7 O LORD, my Lord, my strong deliverer, you have covered my head in the day of battle.
19½Ã 140:8 Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plot. Selah
19½Ã 140:9 Those who surround me lift up their heads; let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!
19½Ã 140:10 Let burning coals fall on them! Let them be flung into pits, no more to rise!
19½Ã 140:11 Do not let the slanderer be established in the land; let evil speedily hunt down the violent!
19½Ã 140:12 I know that the LORD maintains the cause of the needy, and executes justice for the poor.
19½Ã 140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall live in your presence.
19½Ã 141:1 A Psalm of David. I call upon you, O LORD; come quickly to me; give ear to my voice when I call to you.
19½Ã 141:2 Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
19½Ã 141:3 Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.
19½Ã 141:4 Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with those who work iniquity; do not let me eat of their delicacies.
19½Ã 141:5 Let the righteous strike me; let the faithful correct me. Never let the oil of the wicked anoint my head, for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.
19½Ã 141:6 When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that my words were pleasant.
19½Ã 141:7 Like a rock that one breaks apart and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.
19½Ã 141:8 But my eyes are turned toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; do not leave me defenseless.
19½Ã 141:9 Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers.
19½Ã 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I alone escape.
19½Ã 142:1 A Maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A Prayer. With my voice I cry to the LORD; with my voice I make supplication to the LORD.
19½Ã 142:2 I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him.
19½Ã 142:3 When my spirit is faint, you know my way. In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
19½Ã 142:4 Look on my right hand and see--there is no one who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for me.
19½Ã 142:5 I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
19½Ã 142:6 Give heed to my cry, for I am brought very low. Save me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.
19½Ã 142:7 Bring me out of prison, so that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.
19½Ã 143:1 A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my supplications in your faithfulness; answer me in your righteousness.
19½Ã 143:2 Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you.
19½Ã 143:3 For the enemy has pursued me, crushing my life to the ground, making me sit in darkness like those long dead.
19½Ã 143:4 Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled.
19½Ã 143:5 I remember the days of old, I think about all your deeds, I meditate on the works of your hands.
19½Ã 143:6 I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah
19½Ã 143:7 Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
19½Ã 143:8 Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust. Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 143:9 Save me, O LORD, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.
19½Ã 143:10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.
19½Ã 143:11 For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life. In your righteousness bring me out of trouble.
19½Ã 143:12 In your steadfast love cut off my enemies, and destroy all my adversaries, for I am your servant.
19½Ã 144:1 Of David. Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;
19½Ã 144:2 my rock and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues the peoples under me.
19½Ã 144:3 O LORD, what are human beings that you regard them, or mortals that you think of them?
19½Ã 144:4 They are like a breath; their days are like a passing shadow.
19½Ã 144:5 Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains so that they smoke.
19½Ã 144:6 Make the lightning flash and scatter them; send out your arrows and rout them.
19½Ã 144:7 Stretch out your hand from on high; set me free and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hand of aliens,
19½Ã 144:8 whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are false.
19½Ã 144:9 I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you,
19½Ã 144:10 the one who gives victory to kings, who rescues his servant David.
19½Ã 144:11 Rescue me from the cruel sword, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are false.
19½Ã 144:12 May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars, cut for the building of a palace.
19½Ã 144:13 May our barns be filled, with produce of every kind; may our sheep increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields,
19½Ã 144:14 and may our cattle be heavy with young. May there be no breach in the walls, no exile, and no cry of distress in our streets.
19½Ã 144:15 Happy are the people to whom such blessings fall; happy are the people whose God is the LORD.
19½Ã 145:1 Praise. Of David. I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever.
19½Ã 145:2 Every day I will bless you, and praise your name forever and ever.
19½Ã 145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; his greatness is unsearchable.
19½Ã 145:4 One generation shall laud your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts.
19½Ã 145:5 On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate.
19½Ã 145:6 The might of your awesome deeds shall be proclaimed, and I will declare your greatness.
19½Ã 145:7 They shall celebrate the fame of your abundant goodness, and shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
19½Ã 145:8 The LORD is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
19½Ã 145:9 The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has made.
19½Ã 145:10 All your works shall give thanks to you, O LORD, and all your faithful shall bless you.
19½Ã 145:11 They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom, and tell of your power,
19½Ã 145:12 to make known to all people your mighty deeds, and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
19½Ã 145:13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations. The LORD is faithful in all his words, and gracious in all his deeds.
19½Ã 145:14 The LORD upholds all who are falling, and raises up all who are bowed down.
19½Ã 145:15 The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food in due season.
19½Ã 145:16 You open your hand, satisfying the desire of every living thing.
19½Ã 145:17 The LORD is just in all his ways, and kind in all his doings.
19½Ã 145:18 The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
19½Ã 145:19 He fulfills the desire of all who fear him; he also hears their cry, and saves them.
19½Ã 145:20 The LORD watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
19½Ã 145:21 My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.
19½Ã 146:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!
19½Ã 146:2 I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God all my life long.
19½Ã 146:3 Do not put your trust in princes, in mortals, in whom there is no help.
19½Ã 146:4 When their breath departs, they return to the earth; on that very day their plans perish.
19½Ã 146:5 Happy are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD their God,
19½Ã 146:6 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps faith forever;
19½Ã 146:7 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free;
19½Ã 146:8 the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.
19½Ã 146:9 The LORD watches over the strangers; he upholds the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.
19½Ã 146:10 The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 147:1 Praise the LORD! How good it is to sing praises to our God; for he is gracious, and a song of praise is fitting.
19½Ã 147:2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel.
19½Ã 147:3 He heals the brokenhearted, and binds up their wounds.
19½Ã 147:4 He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.
19½Ã 147:5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.
19½Ã 147:6 The LORD lifts up the downtrodden; he casts the wicked to the ground.
19½Ã 147:7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make melody to our God on the lyre.
19½Ã 147:8 He covers the heavens with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, makes grass grow on the hills.
19½Ã 147:9 He gives to the animals their food, and to the young ravens when they cry.
19½Ã 147:10 His delight is not in the strength of the horse, nor his pleasure in the speed of a runner;
19½Ã 147:11 but the LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love.
19½Ã 147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!
19½Ã 147:13 For he strengthens the bars of your gates; he blesses your children within you.
19½Ã 147:14 He grants peace within your borders; he fills you with the finest of wheat.
19½Ã 147:15 He sends out his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly.
19½Ã 147:16 He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes.
19½Ã 147:17 He hurls down hail like crumbs--who can stand before his cold?
19½Ã 147:18 He sends out his word, and melts them; he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.
19½Ã 147:19 He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and ordinances to Israel.
19½Ã 147:20 He has not dealt thus with any other nation; they do not know his ordinances. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 148:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights!
19½Ã 148:2 Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his host!
19½Ã 148:3 Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars!
19½Ã 148:4 Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens!
19½Ã 148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for he commanded and they were created.
19½Ã 148:6 He established them forever and ever; he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed.
19½Ã 148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, you sea monsters and all deeps,
19½Ã 148:8 fire and hail, snow and frost, stormy wind fulfilling his command!
19½Ã 148:9 Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars!
19½Ã 148:10 Wild animals and all cattle, creeping things and flying birds!
19½Ã 148:11 Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth!
19½Ã 148:12 Young men and women alike, old and young together!
19½Ã 148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his glory is above earth and heaven.
19½Ã 148:14 He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his faithful, for the people of Israel who are close to him. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 149:1 Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
19½Ã 149:2 Let Israel be glad in its Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.
19½Ã 149:3 Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and lyre.
19½Ã 149:4 For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with victory.
19½Ã 149:5 Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their couches.
19½Ã 149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,
19½Ã 149:7 to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
19½Ã 149:8 to bind their kings with fetters and their nobles with chains of iron,
19½Ã 149:9 to execute on them the judgment decreed. This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 150:1 Praise the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty firmament!
19½Ã 150:2 Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his surpassing greatness!
19½Ã 150:3 Praise him with trumpet sound; praise him with lute and harp!
19½Ã 150:4 Praise him with tambourine and dance; praise him with strings and pipe!
19½Ã 150:5 Praise him with clanging cymbals; praise him with loud clashing cymbals!
19½Ã 150:6 Let everything that breathes praise the LORD! Praise the LORD!

20Àá 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
20Àá 1:2 For learning about wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight,
20Àá 1:3 for gaining instruction in wise dealing, righteousness, justice, and equity;
20Àá 1:4 to teach shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and prudence to the young--
20Àá 1:5 Let the wise also hear and gain in learning, and the discerning acquire skill,
20Àá 1:6 to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.
20Àá 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.
20Àá 1:8 Hear, my child, your father's instruction, and do not reject your mother's teaching;
20Àá 1:9 for they are a fair garland for your head, and pendants for your neck.
20Àá 1:10 My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
20Àá 1:11 If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us wantonly ambush the innocent;
20Àá 1:12 like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole, like those who go down to the Pit.
20Àá 1:13 We shall find all kinds of costly things; we shall fill our houses with booty.
20Àá 1:14 Throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"--
20Àá 1:15 my child, do not walk in their way, keep your foot from their paths;
20Àá 1:16 for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood.
20Àá 1:17 For in vain is the net baited while the bird is looking on;
20Àá 1:18 yet they lie in wait--to kill themselves! and set an ambush--for their own lives!
20Àá 1:19 Such is the end of all who are greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.
20Àá 1:20 Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.
20Àá 1:21 At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
20Àá 1:22 "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?
20Àá 1:23 Give heed to my reproof; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.
20Àá 1:24 Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,
20Àá 1:25 and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,
20Àá 1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,
20Àá 1:27 when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
20Àá 1:28 Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.
20Àá 1:29 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,
20Àá 1:30 would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,
20Àá 1:31 therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.
20Àá 1:32 For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;
20Àá 1:33 but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster."
20Àá 2:1 My child, if you accept my words and treasure up my commandments within you,
20Àá 2:2 making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;
20Àá 2:3 if you indeed cry out for insight, and raise your voice for understanding;
20Àá 2:4 if you seek it like silver, and search for it as for hidden treasures--
20Àá 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.
20Àá 2:6 For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
20Àá 2:7 he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk blamelessly,
20Àá 2:8 guarding the paths of justice and preserving the way of his faithful ones.
20Àá 2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;
20Àá 2:10 for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
20Àá 2:11 prudence will watch over you; and understanding will guard you.
20Àá 2:12 It will save you from the way of evil, from those who speak perversely,
20Àá 2:13 who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
20Àá 2:14 who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil;
20Àá 2:15 those whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.
20Àá 2:16 You will be saved from the loose woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,
20Àá 2:17 who forsakes the partner of her youth and forgets her sacred covenant;
20Àá 2:18 for her way leads down to death, and her paths to the shades;
20Àá 2:19 those who go to her never come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.
20Àá 2:20 Therefore walk in the way of the good, and keep to the paths of the just.
20Àá 2:21 For the upright will abide in the land, and the innocent will remain in it;
20Àá 2:22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
20Àá 3:1 My child, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;
20Àá 3:2 for length of days and years of life and abundant welfare they will give you.
20Àá 3:3 Do not let loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Àá 3:4 So you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God and of people.
20Àá 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight.
20Àá 3:6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.
20Àá 3:7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.
20Àá 3:8 It will be a healing for your flesh and a refreshment for your body.
20Àá 3:9 Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first fruits of all your produce;
20Àá 3:10 then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.
20Àá 3:11 My child, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,
20Àá 3:12 for the LORD reproves the one he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
20Àá 3:13 Happy are those who find wisdom, and those who get understanding,
20Àá 3:14 for her income is better than silver, and her revenue better than gold.
20Àá 3:15 She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
20Àá 3:16 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20Àá 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
20Àá 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called happy.
20Àá 3:19 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;
20Àá 3:20 by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.
20Àá 3:21 My child, do not let these escape from your sight: keep sound wisdom and prudence,
20Àá 3:22 and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.
20Àá 3:23 Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble.
20Àá 3:24 If you sit down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20Àá 3:25 Do not be afraid of sudden panic, or of the storm that strikes the wicked;
20Àá 3:26 for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.
20Àá 3:27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.
20Àá 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you.
20Àá 3:29 Do not plan harm against your neighbor who lives trustingly beside you.
20Àá 3:30 Do not quarrel with anyone without cause, when no harm has been done to you.
20Àá 3:31 Do not envy the violent and do not choose any of their ways;
20Àá 3:32 for the perverse are an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.
20Àá 3:33 The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the abode of the righteous.
20Àá 3:34 Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he shows favor.
20Àá 3:35 The wise will inherit honor, but stubborn fools, disgrace.
20Àá 4:1 Listen, children, to a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight;
20Àá 4:2 for I give you good precepts: do not forsake my teaching.
20Àá 4:3 When I was a son with my father, tender, and my mother's favorite,
20Àá 4:4 he taught me, and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.
20Àá 4:5 Get wisdom; get insight: do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
20Àá 4:6 Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.
20Àá 4:7 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever else you get, get insight.
20Àá 4:8 Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
20Àá 4:9 She will place on your head a fair garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."
20Àá 4:10 Hear, my child, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.
20Àá 4:11 I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.
20Àá 4:12 When you walk, your step will not be hampered; and if you run, you will not stumble.
20Àá 4:13 Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.
20Àá 4:14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evildoers.
20Àá 4:15 Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.
20Àá 4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.
20Àá 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20Àá 4:18 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
20Àá 4:19 The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over.
20Àá 4:20 My child, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
20Àá 4:21 Do not let them escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.
20Àá 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.
20Àá 4:23 Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.
20Àá 4:24 Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.
20Àá 4:25 Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.
20Àá 4:26 Keep straight the path of your feet, and all your ways will be sure.
20Àá 4:27 Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.
20Àá 5:1 My child, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,
20Àá 5:2 so that you may hold on to prudence, and your lips may guard knowledge.
20Àá 5:3 For the lips of a loose woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;
20Àá 5:4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
20Àá 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol.
20Àá 5:6 She does not keep straight to the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.
20Àá 5:7 And now, my child, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
20Àá 5:8 Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house;
20Àá 5:9 or you will give your honor to others, and your years to the merciless,
20Àá 5:10 and strangers will take their fill of your wealth, and your labors will go to the house of an alien;
20Àá 5:11 and at the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,
20Àá 5:12 and you say, "Oh, how I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
20Àá 5:13 I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
20Àá 5:14 Now I am at the point of utter ruin in the public assembly."
20Àá 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
20Àá 5:16 Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
20Àá 5:17 Let them be for yourself alone, and not for sharing with strangers.
20Àá 5:18 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
20Àá 5:19 a lovely deer, a graceful doe. May her breasts satisfy you at all times; may you be intoxicated always by her love.
20Àá 5:20 Why should you be intoxicated, my son, by another woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
20Àá 5:21 For human ways are under the eyes of the LORD, and he examines all their paths.
20Àá 5:22 The iniquities of the wicked ensnare them, and they are caught in the toils of their sin.
20Àá 5:23 They die for lack of discipline, and because of their great folly they are lost.
20Àá 6:1 My child, if you have given your pledge to your neighbor, if you have bound yourself to another,
20Àá 6:2 you are snared by the utterance of your lips, caught by the words of your mouth.
20Àá 6:3 So do this, my child, and save yourself, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go, hurry, and plead with your neighbor.
20Àá 6:4 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;
20Àá 6:5 save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
20Àá 6:6 Go to the ant, you lazybones; consider its ways, and be wise.
20Àá 6:7 Without having any chief or officer or ruler,
20Àá 6:8 it prepares its food in summer, and gathers its sustenance in harvest.
20Àá 6:9 How long will you lie there, O lazybones? When will you rise from your sleep?
20Àá 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
20Àá 6:11 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want, like an armed warrior.
20Àá 6:12 A scoundrel and a villain goes around with crooked speech,
20Àá 6:13 winking the eyes, shuffling the feet, pointing the fingers,
20Àá 6:14 with perverted mind devising evil, continually sowing discord;
20Àá 6:15 on such a one calamity will descend suddenly; in a moment, damage beyond repair.
20Àá 6:16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:
20Àá 6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
20Àá 6:18 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that hurry to run to evil,
20Àá 6:19 a lying witness who testifies falsely, and one who sows discord in a family.
20Àá 6:20 My child, keep your father's commandment, and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
20Àá 6:21 Bind them upon your heart always; tie them around your neck.
20Àá 6:22 When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.
20Àá 6:23 For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
20Àá 6:24 to preserve you from the wife of another, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
20Àá 6:25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;
20Àá 6:26 for a prostitute's fee is only a loaf of bread, but the wife of another stalks a man's very life.
20Àá 6:27 Can fire be carried in the bosom without burning one's clothes?
20Àá 6:28 Or can one walk on hot coals without scorching the feet?
20Àá 6:29 So is he who sleeps with his neighbor's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20Àá 6:30 Thieves are not despised who steal only to satisfy their appetite when they are hungry.
20Àá 6:31 Yet if they are caught, they will pay sevenfold; they will forfeit all the goods of their house.
20Àá 6:32 But he who commits adultery has no sense; he who does it destroys himself.
20Àá 6:33 He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
20Àá 6:34 For jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he shows no restraint when he takes revenge.
20Àá 6:35 He will accept no compensation, and refuses a bribe no matter how great.
20Àá 7:1 My child, keep my words and store up my commandments with you;
20Àá 7:2 keep my commandments and live, keep my teachings as the apple of your eye;
20Àá 7:3 bind them on your fingers, write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Àá 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,
20Àá 7:5 that they may keep you from the loose woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.
20Àá 7:6 For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,
20Àá 7:7 and I saw among the simple ones, I observed among the youths, a young man without sense,
20Àá 7:8 passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house
20Àá 7:9 in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.
20Àá 7:10 Then a woman comes toward him, decked out like a prostitute, wily of heart.
20Àá 7:11 She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;
20Àá 7:12 now in the street, now in the squares, and at every corner she lies in wait.
20Àá 7:13 She seizes him and kisses him, and with impudent face she says to him:
20Àá 7:14 "I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;
20Àá 7:15 so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you!
20Àá 7:16 I have decked my couch with coverings, colored spreads of Egyptian linen;
20Àá 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20Àá 7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; let us delight ourselves with love.
20Àá 7:19 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
20Àá 7:20 He took a bag of money with him; he will not come home until full moon."
20Àá 7:21 With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.
20Àá 7:22 Right away he follows her, and goes like an ox to the slaughter, or bounds like a stag toward the trap
20Àá 7:23 until an arrow pierces its entrails. He is like a bird rushing into a snare, not knowing that it will cost him his life.
20Àá 7:24 And now, my children, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.
20Àá 7:25 Do not let your hearts turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.
20Àá 7:26 for many are those she has laid low, and numerous are her victims.
20Àá 7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
20Àá 8:1 Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?
20Àá 8:2 On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;
20Àá 8:3 beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out:
20Àá 8:4 "To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live.
20Àá 8:5 O simple ones, learn prudence; acquire intelligence, you who lack it.
20Àá 8:6 Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right;
20Àá 8:7 for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
20Àá 8:8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.
20Àá 8:9 They are all straight to one who understands and right to those who find knowledge.
20Àá 8:10 Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
20Àá 8:11 for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
20Àá 8:12 I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I attain knowledge and discretion.
20Àá 8:13 The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
20Àá 8:14 I have good advice and sound wisdom; I have insight, I have strength.
20Àá 8:15 By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;
20Àá 8:16 by me rulers rule, and nobles, all who govern rightly.
20Àá 8:17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.
20Àá 8:18 Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and prosperity.
20Àá 8:19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.
20Àá 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20Àá 8:21 endowing with wealth those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
20Àá 8:22 The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.
20Àá 8:23 Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
20Àá 8:24 When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.
20Àá 8:25 Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth--
20Àá 8:26 when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world's first bits of soil.
20Àá 8:27 When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
20Àá 8:28 when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
20Àá 8:29 when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
20Àá 8:30 then I was beside him, like a master worker; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,
20Àá 8:31 rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.
20Àá 8:32 And now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways.
20Àá 8:33 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.
20Àá 8:34 Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
20Àá 8:35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD;
20Àá 8:36 but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death."
20Àá 9:1 Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn her seven pillars.
20Àá 9:2 She has slaughtered her animals, she has mixed her wine, she has also set her table.
20Àá 9:3 She has sent out her servant girls, she calls from the highest places in the town,
20Àá 9:4 "You that are simple, turn in here!" To those without sense she says,
20Àá 9:5 "Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.
20Àá 9:6 Lay aside immaturity, and live, and walk in the way of insight."
20Àá 9:7 Whoever corrects a scoffer wins abuse; whoever rebukes the wicked gets hurt.
20Àá 9:8 A scoffer who is rebuked will only hate you; the wise, when rebuked, will love you.
20Àá 9:9 Give instruction to the wise, and they will become wiser still; teach the righteous and they will gain in learning.
20Àá 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
20Àá 9:11 For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
20Àá 9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
20Àá 9:13 The foolish woman is loud; she is ignorant and knows nothing.
20Àá 9:14 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the high places of the town,
20Àá 9:15 calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,
20Àá 9:16 "You who are simple, turn in here!" And to those without sense she says,
20Àá 9:17 "Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."
20Àá 9:18 But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

20Àá 17:3 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the LORD tests the heart.
20Àá 17:4 An evildoer listens to wicked lips; and a liar gives heed to a mischievous tongue.
20Àá 17:5 Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who are glad at calamity will not go unpunished.
20Àá 17:6 Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their parents.
20Àá 17:7 Fine speech is not becoming to a fool; still less is false speech to a ruler.
20Àá 17:8 A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of those who give it; wherever they turn they prosper.
20Àá 17:9 One who forgives an affront fosters friendship, but one who dwells on disputes will alienate a friend.
20Àá 17:10 A rebuke strikes deeper into a discerning person than a hundred blows into a fool.
20Àá 17:11 Evil people seek only rebellion, but a cruel messenger will be sent against them.
20Àá 17:12 Better to meet a she-bear robbed of its cubs than to confront a fool immersed in folly.
20Àá 17:13 Evil will not depart from the house of one who returns evil for good.
20Àá 17:14 The beginning of strife is like letting out water; so stop before the quarrel breaks out.
20Àá 17:15 One who justifies the wicked and one who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD.
20Àá 17:16 Why should fools have a price in hand to buy wisdom, when they have no mind to learn?
20Àá 17:17 A friend loves at all times, and kinsfolk are born to share adversity.
20Àá 17:18 It is senseless to give a pledge, to become surety for a neighbor.
20Àá 17:19 One who loves transgression loves strife; one who builds a high threshold invites broken bones.
20Àá 17:20 The crooked of mind do not prosper, and the perverse of tongue fall into calamity.
20Àá 17:21 The one who begets a fool gets trouble; the parent of a fool has no joy.
20Àá 17:22 A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the bones.
20Àá 17:23 The wicked accept a concealed bribe to pervert the ways of justice.
20Àá 17:24 The discerning person looks to wisdom, but the eyes of a fool to the ends of the earth.
20Àá 17:25 Foolish children are a grief to their father and bitterness to her who bore them.
20Àá 17:26 To impose a fine on the innocent is not right, or to flog the noble for their integrity.
20Àá 17:27 One who spares words is knowledgeable; one who is cool in spirit has understanding.
20Àá 17:28 Even fools who keep silent are considered wise; when they close their lips, they are deemed intelligent.
20Àá 18:1 The one who lives alone is self-indulgent, showing contempt for all who have sound judgment.
20Àá 18:2 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing personal opinion.
20Àá 18:3 When wickedness comes, contempt comes also; and with dishonor comes disgrace.
20Àá 18:4 The words of the mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a gushing stream.
20Àá 18:5 It is not right to be partial to the guilty, or to subvert the innocent in judgment.
20Àá 18:6 A fool's lips bring strife, and a fool's mouth invites a flogging.
20Àá 18:7 The mouths of fools are their ruin, and their lips a snare to themselves.
20Àá 18:8 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.
20Àá 18:9 One who is slack in work is close kin to a vandal.
20Àá 18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe.
20Àá 18:11 The wealth of the rich is their strong city; in their imagination it is like a high wall.
20Àá 18:12 Before destruction one's heart is haughty, but humility goes before honor.
20Àá 18:13 If one gives answer before hearing, it is folly and shame.
20Àá 18:14 The human spirit will endure sickness; but a broken spirit--who can bear?
20Àá 18:15 An intelligent mind acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
20Àá 18:16 A gift opens doors; it gives access to the great.
20Àá 18:17 The one who first states a case seems right, until the other comes and cross-examines.
20Àá 18:18 Casting the lot puts an end to disputes and decides between powerful contenders.
20Àá 18:19 An ally offended is stronger than a city; such quarreling is like the bars of a castle.
20Àá 18:20 From the fruit of the mouth one's stomach is satisfied; the yield of the lips brings satisfaction.
20Àá 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.
20Àá 18:22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from the LORD.
20Àá 18:23 The poor use entreaties, but the rich answer roughly.
20Àá 18:24 Some friends play at friendship but a true friend sticks closer than one's nearest kin.
20Àá 19:1 Better the poor walking in integrity than one perverse of speech who is a fool.
20Àá 19:2 Desire without knowledge is not good, and one who moves too hurriedly misses the way.
20Àá 19:3 One's own folly leads to ruin, yet the heart rages against the LORD.
20Àá 19:4 Wealth brings many friends, but the poor are left friendless.
20Àá 19:5 A false witness will not go unpunished, and a liar will not escape.
20Àá 19:6 Many seek the favor of the generous, and everyone is a friend to a giver of gifts.
20Àá 19:7 If the poor are hated even by their kin, how much more are they shunned by their friends! When they call after them, they are not there.
20Àá 19:8 To get wisdom is to love oneself; to keep understanding is to prosper.
20Àá 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and the liar will perish.
20Àá 19:10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury, much less for a slave to rule over princes.
20Àá 19:11 Those with good sense are slow to anger, and it is their glory to overlook an offense.
20Àá 19:12 A king's anger is like the growling of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.
20Àá 19:13 A stupid child is ruin to a father, and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain.
20Àá 19:14 House and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.
20Àá 19:15 Laziness brings on deep sleep; an idle person will suffer hunger.
20Àá 19:16 Those who keep the commandment will live; those who are heedless of their ways will die.
20Àá 19:17 Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and will be repaid in full.
20Àá 19:18 Discipline your children while there is hope; do not set your heart on their destruction.
20Àá 19:19 A violent tempered person will pay the penalty; if you effect a rescue, you will only have to do it again.
20Àá 19:20 Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom for the future.
20Àá 19:21 The human mind may devise many plans, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established.
20Àá 19:22 What is desirable in a person is loyalty, and it is better to be poor than a liar.
20Àá 19:23 The fear of the LORD is life indeed; filled with it one rests secure and suffers no harm.
20Àá 19:24 The lazy person buries a hand in the dish, and will not even bring it back to the mouth.
20Àá 19:25 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove the intelligent, and they will gain knowledge.
20Àá 19:26 Those who do violence to their father and chase away their mother are children who cause shame and bring reproach.
20Àá 19:27 Cease straying, my child, from the words of knowledge, in order that you may hear instruction.
20Àá 19:28 A worthless witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
20Àá 19:29 Condemnation is ready for scoffers, and flogging for the backs of fools.
20Àá 20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.
20Àá 20:2 The dread anger of a king is like the growling of a lion; anyone who provokes him to anger forfeits life itself.
20Àá 20:3 It is honorable to refrain from strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.
20Àá 20:4 The lazy person does not plow in season; harvest comes, and there is nothing to be found.
20Àá 20:5 The purposes in the human mind are like deep water, but the intelligent will draw them out.
20Àá 20:6 Many proclaim themselves loyal, but who can find one worthy of trust?
20Àá 20:7 The righteous walk in integrity--happy are the children who follow them!
20Àá 20:8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil with his eyes.
20Àá 20:9 Who can say, "I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my sin"?
20Àá 20:10 Diverse weights and diverse measures are both alike an abomination to the LORD.
20Àá 20:11 Even children make themselves known by their acts, by whether what they do is pure and right.
20Àá 20:12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye--the LORD has made them both.
20Àá 20:13 Do not love sleep, or else you will come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.
20Àá 20:14 "Bad, bad," says the buyer, then goes away and boasts.
20Àá 20:15 There is gold, and abundance of costly stones; but the lips informed by knowledge are a precious jewel.
20Àá 20:16 Take the garment of one who has given surety for a stranger; seize the pledge given as surety for foreigners.
20Àá 20:17 Bread gained by deceit is sweet, but afterward the mouth will be full of gravel.
20Àá 20:18 Plans are established by taking advice; wage war by following wise guidance.
20Àá 20:19 A gossip reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a babbler.
20Àá 20:20 If you curse father or mother, your lamp will go out in utter darkness.
20Àá 20:21 An estate quickly acquired in the beginning will not be blessed in the end.
20Àá 20:22 Do not say, "I will repay evil"; wait for the LORD, and he will help you.
20Àá 20:23 Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD, and false scales are not good.
20Àá 20:24 All our steps are ordered by the LORD; how then can we understand our own ways?
20Àá 20:25 It is a snare for one to say rashly, "It is holy," and begin to reflect only after making a vow.
20Àá 20:26 A wise king winnows the wicked, and drives the wheel over them.
20Àá 20:27 The human spirit is the lamp of the LORD, searching every innermost part.
20Àá 20:28 Loyalty and faithfulness preserve the king, and his throne is upheld by righteousness.
20Àá 20:29 The glory of youths is their strength, but the beauty of the aged is their gray hair.
20Àá 20:30 Blows that wound cleanse away evil; beatings make clean the innermost parts.
20Àá 21:1 The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will.
20Àá 21:2 All deeds are right in the sight of the doer, but the LORD weighs the heart.
20Àá 21:3 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
20Àá 21:4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart--the lamp of the wicked--are sin.
20Àá 21:5 The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to want.
20Àá 21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.
20Àá 21:7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to do what is just.
20Àá 21:8 The way of the guilty is crooked, but the conduct of the pure is right.
20Àá 21:9 It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a contentious wife.
20Àá 21:10 The souls of the wicked desire evil; their neighbors find no mercy in their eyes.
20Àá 21:11 When a scoffer is punished, the simple become wiser; when the wise are instructed, they increase in knowledge.
20Àá 21:12 The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked; he casts the wicked down to ruin.
20Àá 21:13 If you close your ear to the cry of the poor, you will cry out and not be heard.
20Àá 21:14 A gift in secret averts anger; and a concealed bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.
20Àá 21:15 When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous, but dismay to evildoers.
20Àá 21:16 Whoever wanders from the way of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.
20Àá 21:17 Whoever loves pleasure will suffer want; whoever loves wine and oil will not be rich.
20Àá 21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.
20Àá 21:19 It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and fretful wife.
20Àá 21:20 Precious treasure remains in the house of the wise, but the fool devours it.
20Àá 21:21 Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness will find life and honor.
20Àá 21:22 One wise person went up against a city of warriors and brought down the stronghold in which they trusted.
20Àá 21:23 To watch over mouth and tongue is to keep out of trouble.
20Àá 21:24 The proud, haughty person, named "Scoffer," acts with arrogant pride.
20Àá 21:25 The craving of the lazy person is fatal, for lazy hands refuse to labor.
20Àá 21:26 All day long the wicked covet, but the righteous give and do not hold back.
20Àá 21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when brought with evil intent.
20Àá 21:28 A false witness will perish, but a good listener will testify successfully.
20Àá 21:29 The wicked put on a bold face, but the upright give thought to their ways.
20Àá 21:30 No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel, can avail against the LORD.
20Àá 21:31 The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD.
20Àá 22:1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold.
20Àá 22:2 The rich and the poor have this in common: the LORD is the maker of them all.
20Àá 22:3 The clever see danger and hide; but the simple go on, and suffer for it.
20Àá 22:4 The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life.
20Àá 22:5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; the cautious will keep far from them.
20Àá 22:6 Train children in the right way, and when old, they will not stray.
20Àá 22:7 The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender.
20Àá 22:8 Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of anger will fail.
20Àá 22:9 Those who are generous are blessed, for they share their bread with the poor.
20Àá 22:10 Drive out a scoffer, and strife goes out; quarreling and abuse will cease.
20Àá 22:11 Those who love a pure heart and are gracious in speech will have the king as a friend.
20Àá 22:12 The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he overthrows the words of the faithless.
20Àá 22:13 The lazy person says, "There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!"
20Àá 22:14 The mouth of a loose woman is a deep pit; he with whom the LORD is angry falls into it.
20Àá 22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a boy, but the rod of discipline drives it far away.
20Àá 22:16 Oppressing the poor in order to enrich oneself, and giving to the rich, will lead only to loss.
20Àá 22:17 The words of the wise: Incline your ear and hear my words, and apply your mind to my teaching;
20Àá 22:18 for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips.
20Àá 22:19 So that your trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to you today--yes, to you.
20Àá 22:20 Have I not written for you thirty sayings of admonition and knowledge,
20Àá 22:21 to show you what is right and true, so that you may give a true answer to those who sent you?
20Àá 22:22 Do not rob the poor because they are poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate;
20Àá 22:23 for the LORD pleads their cause and despoils of life those who despoil them.
20Àá 22:24 Make no friends with those given to anger, and do not associate with hotheads,
20Àá 22:25 or you may learn their ways and entangle yourself in a snare.
20Àá 22:26 Do not be one of those who give pledges, who become surety for debts.
20Àá 22:27 If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?
20Àá 22:28 Do not remove the ancient landmark that your ancestors set up.
20Àá 22:29 Do you see those who are skillful in their work? they will serve kings; they will not serve common people.
20Àá 23:1 When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you,
20Àá 23:2 and put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite.
20Àá 23:3 Do not desire the ruler's delicacies, for they are deceptive food.
20Àá 23:4 Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to desist.
20Àá 23:5 When your eyes light upon it, it is gone; for suddenly it takes wings to itself, flying like an eagle toward heaven.
20Àá 23:6 Do not eat the bread of the stingy; do not desire their delicacies;
20Àá 23:7 for like a hair in the throat, so are they. "Eat and drink!" they say to you; but they do not mean it.
20Àá 23:8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten, and you will waste your pleasant words.
20Àá 23:9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, who will only despise the wisdom of your words.
20Àá 23:10 Do not remove an ancient landmark or encroach on the fields of orphans,
20Àá 23:11 for their redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you.
20Àá 23:12 Apply your mind to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge.
20Àá 23:13 Do not withhold discipline from your children; if you beat them with a rod, they will not die.
20Àá 23:14 If you beat them with the rod, you will save their lives from Sheol.
20Àá 23:15 My child, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad.
20Àá 23:16 My soul will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
20Àá 23:17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.
20Àá 23:18 Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
20Àá 23:19 Hear, my child, and be wise, and direct your mind in the way.
20Àá 23:20 Do not be among winebibbers, or among gluttonous eaters of meat;
20Àá 23:21 for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them with rags.
20Àá 23:22 Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
20Àá 23:23 Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
20Àá 23:24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.
20Àá 23:25 Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.
20Àá 23:26 My child, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.
20Àá 23:27 For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well.
20Àá 23:28 She lies in wait like a robber and increases the number of the faithless.
20Àá 23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
20Àá 23:30 Those who linger late over wine, those who keep trying mixed wines.
20Àá 23:31 Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.
20Àá 23:32 At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.
20Àá 23:33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind utter perverse things.
20Àá 23:34 You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast.
20Àá 23:35 "They struck me," you will say, "but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink."
20Àá 24:1 Do not envy the wicked, nor desire to be with them;
20Àá 24:2 for their minds devise violence, and their lips talk of mischief.
20Àá 24:3 By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
20Àá 24:4 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
20Àá 24:5 Wise warriors are mightier than strong ones, and those who have knowledge than those who have strength;
20Àá 24:6 for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.
20Àá 24:7 Wisdom is too high for fools; in the gate they do not open their mouths.
20Àá 24:8 Whoever plans to do evil will be called a mischief-maker.
20Àá 24:9 The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to all.
20Àá 24:10 If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength being small;
20Àá 24:11 if you hold back from rescuing those taken away to death, those who go staggering to the slaughter;
20Àá 24:12 if you say, "Look, we did not know this"--does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it? And will he not repay all according to their deeds?
20Àá 24:13 My child, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
20Àá 24:14 Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, you will find a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
20Àá 24:15 Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against the home of the righteous; do no violence to the place where the righteous live;
20Àá 24:16 for though they fall seven times, they will rise again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
20Àá 24:17 Do not rejoice when your enemies fall, and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
20Àá 24:18 or else the LORD will see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from them.
20Àá 24:19 Do not fret because of evildoers. Do not envy the wicked;
20Àá 24:20 for the evil have no future; the lamp of the wicked will go out.
20Àá 24:21 My child, fear the LORD and the king, and do not disobey either of them;
20Àá 24:22 for disaster comes from them suddenly, and who knows the ruin that both can bring?
20Àá 24:23 These also are sayings of the wise: Partiality in judging is not good.
20Àá 24:24 Whoever says to the wicked, "You are innocent," will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations;
20Àá 24:25 but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.
20Àá 24:26 One who gives an honest answer gives a kiss on the lips.
20Àá 24:27 Prepare your work outside, get everything ready for you in the field; and after that build your house.
20Àá 24:28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.
20Àá 24:29 Do not say, "I will do to others as they have done to me; I will pay them back for what they have done."
20Àá 24:30 I passed by the field of one who was lazy, by the vineyard of a stupid person;
20Àá 24:31 and see, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
20Àá 24:32 Then I saw and considered it; I looked and received instruction.
20Àá 24:33 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
20Àá 24:34 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want, like an armed warrior.
20Àá 25:1 These are other proverbs of Solomon that the officials of King Hezekiah of Judah copied.
20Àá 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out.
20Àá 25:3 Like the heavens for height, like the earth for depth, so the mind of kings is unsearchable.
20Àá 25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and the smith has material for a vessel;
20Àá 25:5 take away the wicked from the presence of the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness.
20Àá 25:6 Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence or stand in the place of the great;
20Àá 25:7 for it is better to be told, "Come up here," than to be put lower in the presence of a noble. What your eyes have seen
20Àá 25:8 do not hastily bring into court; for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame?
20Àá 25:9 Argue your case with your neighbor directly, and do not disclose another's secret;
20Àá 25:10 or else someone who hears you will bring shame upon you, and your ill repute will have no end.
20Àá 25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.
20Àá 25:12 Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise rebuke to a listening ear.
20Àá 25:13 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest are faithful messengers to those who send them; they refresh the spirit of their masters.
20Àá 25:14 Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts of a gift never given.
20Àá 25:15 With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue can break bones.
20Àá 25:16 If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, or else, having too much, you will vomit it.
20Àá 25:17 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, otherwise the neighbor will become weary of you and hate you.
20Àá 25:18 Like a war club, a sword, or a sharp arrow is one who bears false witness against a neighbor.
20Àá 25:19 Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is trust in a faithless person in time of trouble.
20Àá 25:20 Like vinegar on a wound is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. Like a moth in clothing or a worm in wood, sorrow gnaws at the human heart.
20Àá 25:21 If your enemies are hungry, give them bread to eat; and if they are thirsty, give them water to drink;
20Àá 25:22 for you will heap coals of fire on their heads, and the LORD will reward you.
20Àá 25:23 The north wind produces rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
20Àá 25:24 It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a contentious wife.
20Àá 25:25 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
20Àá 25:26 Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain are the righteous who give way before the wicked.
20Àá 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey, or to seek honor on top of honor.
20Àá 25:28 Like a city breached, without walls, is one who lacks self-control.
20Àá 26:1 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.
20Àá 26:2 Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying, an undeserved curse goes nowhere.
20Àá 26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools.
20Àá 26:4 Do not answer fools according to their folly, or you will be a fool yourself.
20Àá 26:5 Answer fools according to their folly, or they will be wise in their own eyes.
20Àá 26:6 It is like cutting off one's foot and drinking down violence, to send a message by a fool.
20Àá 26:7 The legs of a disabled person hang limp; so does a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20Àá 26:8 It is like binding a stone in a sling to give honor to a fool.
20Àá 26:9 Like a thornbush brandished by the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20Àá 26:10 Like an archer who wounds everybody is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard.
20Àá 26:11 Like a dog that returns to its vomit is a fool who reverts to his folly.
20Àá 26:12 Do you see persons wise in their own eyes? There is more hope for fools than for them.
20Àá 26:13 The lazy person says, "There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!"
20Àá 26:14 As a door turns on its hinges, so does a lazy person in bed.
20Àá 26:15 The lazy person buries a hand in the dish, and is too tired to bring it back to the mouth.
20Àá 26:16 The lazy person is wiser in self-esteem than seven who can answer discreetly.
20Àá 26:17 Like somebody who takes a passing dog by the ears is one who meddles in the quarrel of another.
20Àá 26:18 Like a maniac who shoots deadly firebrands and arrows,
20Àá 26:19 so is one who deceives a neighbor and says, "I am only joking!"
20Àá 26:20 For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.
20Àá 26:21 As charcoal is to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
20Àá 26:22 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.
20Àá 26:23 Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are smooth lips with an evil heart.
20Àá 26:24 An enemy dissembles in speaking while harboring deceit within;
20Àá 26:25 when an enemy speaks graciously, do not believe it, for there are seven abominations concealed within;
20Àá 26:26 though hatred is covered with guile, the enemy's wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
20Àá 26:27 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on the one who starts it rolling.
20Àá 26:28 A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
20Àá 27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
20Àá 27:2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth--a stranger, and not your own lips.
20Àá 27:3 A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both.
20Àá 27:4 Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who is able to stand before jealousy?
20Àá 27:5 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
20Àá 27:6 Well meant are the wounds a friend inflicts, but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
20Àá 27:7 The sated appetite spurns honey, but to a ravenous appetite even the bitter is sweet.
20Àá 27:8 Like a bird that strays from its nest is one who strays from home.
20Àá 27:9 Perfume and incense make the heart glad, but the soul is torn by trouble.
20Àá 27:10 Do not forsake your friend or the friend of your parent; do not go to the house of your kindred in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is nearby than kindred who are far away.
20Àá 27:11 Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad, so that I may answer whoever reproaches me.
20Àá 27:12 The clever see danger and hide; but the simple go on, and suffer for it.
20Àá 27:13 Take the garment of one who has given surety for a stranger; seize the pledge given as surety for foreigners.
20Àá 27:14 Whoever blesses a neighbor with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, will be counted as cursing.
20Àá 27:15 A continual dripping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike;
20Àá 27:16 to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in the right hand.
20Àá 27:17 Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens the wits of another.
20Àá 27:18 Anyone who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and anyone who takes care of a master will be honored.
20Àá 27:19 Just as water reflects the face, so one human heart reflects another.
20Àá 27:20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and human eyes are never satisfied.
20Àá 27:21 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, so a person is tested by being praised.
20Àá 27:22 Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, but the folly will not be driven out.
20Àá 27:23 Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds;
20Àá 27:24 for riches do not last forever, nor a crown for all generations.
20Àá 27:25 When the grass is gone, and new growth appears, and the herbage of the mountains is gathered,
20Àá 27:26 the lambs will provide your clothing, and the goats the price of a field;
20Àá 27:27 there will be enough goats' milk for your food, for the food of your household and nourishment for your servant girls.
20Àá 28:1 The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
20Àá 28:2 When a land rebels it has many rulers; but with an intelligent ruler there is lasting order.
20Àá 28:3 A ruler who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food.
20Àá 28:4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law struggle against them.
20Àá 28:5 The evil do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it completely.
20Àá 28:6 Better to be poor and walk in integrity than to be crooked in one's ways even though rich.
20Àá 28:7 Those who keep the law are wise children, but companions of gluttons shame their parents.
20Àá 28:8 One who augments wealth by exorbitant interest gathers it for another who is kind to the poor.
20Àá 28:9 When one will not listen to the law, even one's prayers are an abomination.
20Àá 28:10 Those who mislead the upright into evil ways will fall into pits of their own making, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance.
20Àá 28:11 The rich is wise in self-esteem, but an intelligent poor person sees through the pose.
20Àá 28:12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked prevail, people go into hiding.
20Àá 28:13 No one who conceals transgressions will prosper, but one who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
20Àá 28:14 Happy is the one who is never without fear, but one who is hard-hearted will fall into calamity.
20Àá 28:15 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
20Àá 28:16 A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor; but one who hates unjust gain will enjoy a long life.
20Àá 28:17 If someone is burdened with the blood of another, let that killer be a fugitive until death; let no one offer assistance.
20Àá 28:18 One who walks in integrity will be safe, but whoever follows crooked ways will fall into the Pit.
20Àá 28:19 Anyone who tills the land will have plenty of bread, but one who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.
20Àá 28:20 The faithful will abound with blessings, but one who is in a hurry to be rich will not go unpunished.
20Àá 28:21 To show partiality is not good--yet for a piece of bread a person may do wrong.
20Àá 28:22 The miser is in a hurry to get rich and does not know that loss is sure to come.
20Àá 28:23 Whoever rebukes a person will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue.
20Àá 28:24 Anyone who robs father or mother and says, "That is no crime," is partner to a thug.
20Àá 28:25 The greedy person stirs up strife, but whoever trusts in the LORD will be enriched.
20Àá 28:26 Those who trust in their own wits are fools; but those who walk in wisdom come through safely.
20Àá 28:27 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but one who turns a blind eye will get many a curse.
20Àá 28:28 When the wicked prevail, people go into hiding; but when they perish, the righteous increase.
20Àá 29:1 One who is often reproved, yet remains stubborn, will suddenly be broken beyond healing.
20Àá 29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
20Àá 29:3 A child who loves wisdom makes a parent glad, but to keep company with prostitutes is to squander one's substance.
20Àá 29:4 By justice a king gives stability to the land, but one who makes heavy exactions ruins it.
20Àá 29:5 Whoever flatters a neighbor is spreading a net for the neighbor's feet.
20Àá 29:6 In the transgression of the evil there is a snare, but the righteous sing and rejoice.
20Àá 29:7 The righteous know the rights of the poor; the wicked have no such understanding.
20Àá 29:8 Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath.
20Àá 29:9 If the wise go to law with fools, there is ranting and ridicule without relief.
20Àá 29:10 The bloodthirsty hate the blameless, and they seek the life of the upright.
20Àá 29:11 A fool gives full vent to anger, but the wise quietly holds it back.
20Àá 29:12 If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials will be wicked.
20Àá 29:13 The poor and the oppressor have this in common: the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
20Àá 29:14 If a king judges the poor with equity, his throne will be established forever.
20Àá 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a mother is disgraced by a neglected child.
20Àá 29:16 When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases, but the righteous will look upon their downfall.
20Àá 29:17 Discipline your children, and they will give you rest; they will give delight to your heart.
20Àá 29:18 Where there is no prophecy, the people cast off restraint, but happy are those who keep the law.
20Àá 29:19 By mere words servants are not disciplined, for though they understand, they will not give heed.
20Àá 29:20 Do you see someone who is hasty in speech? There is more hope for a fool than for anyone like that.
20Àá 29:21 A slave pampered from childhood will come to a bad end.
20Àá 29:22 One given to anger stirs up strife, and the hothead causes much transgression.
20Àá 29:23 A person's pride will bring humiliation, but one who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.
20Àá 29:24 To be a partner of a thief is to hate one's own life; one hears the victim's curse, but discloses nothing.
20Àá 29:25 The fear of others lays a snare, but one who trusts in the LORD is secure.
20Àá 29:26 Many seek the favor of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that one gets justice.
20Àá 29:27 The unjust are an abomination to the righteous, but the upright are an abomination to the wicked.
20Àá 30:1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh. An oracle. Thus says the man: I am weary, O God, I am weary, O God. How can I prevail?
20Àá 30:2 Surely I am too stupid to be human; I do not have human understanding.
20Àá 30:3 I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the holy ones.
20Àá 30:4 Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of the hand? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is the person's name? And what is the name of the person's child? Surely you know!
20Àá 30:5 Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
20Àá 30:6 Do not add to his words, or else he will rebuke you, and you will be found a liar.
20Àá 30:7 Two things I ask of you; do not deny them to me before I die:
20Àá 30:8 Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that I need,
20Àá 30:9 or I shall be full, and deny you, and say, "Who is the LORD?" or I shall be poor, and steal, and profane the name of my God.
20Àá 30:10 Do not slander a servant to a master, or the servant will curse you, and you will be held guilty.
20Àá 30:11 There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
20Àá 30:12 There are those who are pure in their own eyes yet are not cleansed of their filthiness.
20Àá 30:13 There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!
20Àá 30:14 There are those whose teeth are swords, whose teeth are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mortals.
20Àá 30:15 The leech has two daughters; "Give, give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":
20Àá 30:16 Sheol, the barren womb, the earth ever thirsty for water, and the fire that never says, "Enough."
20Àá 30:17 The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.
20Àá 30:18 Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:
20Àá 30:19 the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a girl.
20Àá 30:20 This is the way of an adulteress: she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, "I have done no wrong."
20Àá 30:21 Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:
20Àá 30:22 a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when glutted with food;
20Àá 30:23 an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.
20Àá 30:24 Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
20Àá 30:25 the ants are a people without strength, yet they provide their food in the summer;
20Àá 30:26 the badgers are a people without power, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
20Àá 30:27 the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;
20Àá 30:28 the lizard can be grasped in the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.
20Àá 30:29 Three things are stately in their stride; four are stately in their gait:
20Àá 30:30 the lion, which is mightiest among wild animals and does not turn back before any;
20Àá 30:31 the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king striding before his people.
20Àá 30:32 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.
20Àá 30:33 For as pressing milk produces curds, and pressing the nose produces blood, so pressing anger produces strife.
20Àá 31:1 The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:
20Àá 31:2 No, my son! No, son of my womb! No, son of my vows!
20Àá 31:3 Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.
20Àá 31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to desire strong drink;
20Àá 31:5 or else they will drink and forget what has been decreed, and will pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
20Àá 31:6 Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;
20Àá 31:7 let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more.
20Àá 31:8 Speak out for those who cannot speak, for the rights of all the destitute.
20Àá 31:9 Speak out, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.
20Àá 31:10 A capable wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.
20Àá 31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
20Àá 31:12 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.
20Àá 31:13 She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.
20Àá 31:14 She is like the ships of the merchant, she brings her food from far away.
20Àá 31:15 She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and tasks for her servant girls.
20Àá 31:16 She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
20Àá 31:17 She girds herself with strength, and makes her arms strong.
20Àá 31:18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.
20Àá 31:19 She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
20Àá 31:20 She opens her hand to the poor, and reaches out her hands to the needy.
20Àá 31:21 She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all her household are clothed in crimson.
20Àá 31:22 She makes herself coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20Àá 31:23 Her husband is known in the city gates, taking his seat among the elders of the land.
20Àá 31:24 She makes linen garments and sells them; she supplies the merchant with sashes.
20Àá 31:25 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
20Àá 31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
20Àá 31:27 She looks well to the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
20Àá 31:28 Her children rise up and call her happy; her husband too, and he praises her:
20Àá 31:29 "Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all."
20Àá 31:30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
20Àá 31:31 Give her a share in the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the city gates.
21
21Àü 1:1 The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21Àü 1:2 Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
21Àü 1:3 What do people gain from all the toil at which they toil under the sun?
21Àü 1:4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
21Àü 1:5 The sun rises and the sun goes down, and hurries to the place where it rises.
21Àü 1:6 The wind blows to the south, and goes around to the north; round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.
21Àü 1:7 All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they continue to flow.
21Àü 1:8 All things are wearisome; more than one can express; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, or the ear filled with hearing.
21Àü 1:9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.
21Àü 1:10 Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has already been, in the ages before us.
21Àü 1:11 The people of long ago are not remembered, nor will there be any remembrance of people yet to come by those who come after them.
21Àü 1:12 I, the Teacher, when king over Israel in Jerusalem,
21Àü 1:13 applied my mind to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven; it is an unhappy business that God has given to human beings to be busy with.
21Àü 1:14 I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun; and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 1:15 What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
21Àü 1:16 I said to myself, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
21Àü 1:17 And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a chasing after wind.
21Àü 1:18 For in much wisdom is much vexation, and those who increase knowledge increase sorrow.
21Àü 2:1 I said to myself, "Come now, I will make a test of pleasure; enjoy yourself." But again, this also was vanity.
21Àü 2:2 I said of laughter, "It is mad," and of pleasure, "What use is it?"
21Àü 2:3 I searched with my mind how to cheer my body with wine--my mind still guiding me with wisdom--and how to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was good for mortals to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
21Àü 2:4 I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself;
21Àü 2:5 I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
21Àü 2:6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
21Àü 2:7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house; I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
21Àü 2:8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and delights of the flesh, and many concubines.
21Àü 2:9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.
21Àü 2:10 Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.
21Àü 2:11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and again, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
21Àü 2:12 So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the one do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.
21Àü 2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
21Àü 2:14 The wise have eyes in their head, but fools walk in darkness. Yet I perceived that the same fate befalls all of them.
21Àü 2:15 Then I said to myself, "What happens to the fool will happen to me also; why then have I been so very wise?" And I said to myself that this also is vanity.
21Àü 2:16 For there is no enduring remembrance of the wise or of fools, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How can the wise die just like fools?
21Àü 2:17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 2:18 I hated all my toil in which I had toiled under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to those who come after me
21Àü 2:19 --and who knows whether they will be wise or foolish? Yet they will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
21Àü 2:20 So I turned and gave my heart up to despair concerning all the toil of my labors under the sun,
21Àü 2:21 because sometimes one who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave all to be enjoyed by another who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
21Àü 2:22 What do mortals get from all the toil and strain with which they toil under the sun?
21Àü 2:23 For all their days are full of pain, and their work is a vexation; even at night their minds do not rest. This also is vanity.
21Àü 2:24 There is nothing better for mortals than to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in their toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God;
21Àü 2:25 for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
21Àü 2:26 For to the one who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 3:1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
21Àü 3:2 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
21Àü 3:3 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
21Àü 3:4 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
21Àü 3:5 a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
21Àü 3:6 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
21Àü 3:7 a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
21Àü 3:8 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
21Àü 3:9 What gain have the workers from their toil?
21Àü 3:10 I have seen the business that God has given to everyone to be busy with.
21Àü 3:11 He has made everything suitable for its time; moreover he has put a sense of past and future into their minds, yet they cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
21Àü 3:12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live;
21Àü 3:13 moreover, it is God's gift that all should eat and drink and take pleasure in all their toil.
21Àü 3:14 I know that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; God has done this, so that all should stand in awe before him.
21Àü 3:15 That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already is; and God seeks out what has gone by.
21Àü 3:16 Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there as well.
21Àü 3:17 I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed a time for every matter, and for every work.
21Àü 3:18 I said in my heart with regard to human beings that God is testing them to show that they are but animals.
21Àü 3:19 For the fate of humans and the fate of animals is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and humans have no advantage over the animals; for all is vanity.
21Àü 3:20 All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.
21Àü 3:21 Who knows whether the human spirit goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?
21Àü 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better than that all should enjoy their work, for that is their lot; who can bring them to see what will be after them?
21Àü 4:1 Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. Look, the tears of the oppressed--with no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power--with no one to comfort them.
21Àü 4:2 And I thought the dead, who have already died, more fortunate than the living, who are still alive;
21Àü 4:3 but better than both is the one who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
21Àü 4:4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from one person's envy of another. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 4:5 Fools fold their hands and consume their own flesh.
21Àü 4:6 Better is a handful with quiet than two handfuls with toil, and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 4:7 Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
21Àü 4:8 the case of solitary individuals, without sons or brothers; yet there is no end to all their toil, and their eyes are never satisfied with riches. "For whom am I toiling," they ask, "and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is vanity and an unhappy business.
21Àü 4:9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
21Àü 4:10 For if they fall, one will lift up the other; but woe to one who is alone and falls and does not have another to help.
21Àü 4:11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone?
21Àü 4:12 And though one might prevail against another, two will withstand one. A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
21Àü 4:13 Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king, who will no longer take advice.
21Àü 4:14 One can indeed come out of prison to reign, even though born poor in the kingdom.
21Àü 4:15 I saw all the living who, moving about under the sun, follow that youth who replaced the king;
21Àü 4:16 there was no end to all those people whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 5:1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; to draw near to listen is better than the sacrifice offered by fools; for they do not know how to keep from doing evil.
21Àü 5:2 Never be rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be quick to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you upon earth; therefore let your words be few.
21Àü 5:3 For dreams come with many cares, and a fool's voice with many words.
21Àü 5:4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay fulfilling it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Fulfill what you vow.
21Àü 5:5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not fulfill it.
21Àü 5:6 Do not let your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake; why should God be angry at your words, and destroy the work of your hands?
21Àü 5:7 With many dreams come vanities and a multitude of words; but fear God.
21Àü 5:8 If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and right, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
21Àü 5:9 But all things considered, this is an advantage for a land: a king for a plowed field.
21Àü 5:10 The lover of money will not be satisfied with money; nor the lover of wealth, with gain. This also is vanity.
21Àü 5:11 When goods increase, those who eat them increase; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
21Àü 5:12 Sweet is the sleep of laborers, whether they eat little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let them sleep.
21Àü 5:13 There is a grievous ill that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owners to their hurt,
21Àü 5:14 and those riches were lost in a bad venture; though they are parents of children, they have nothing in their hands.
21Àü 5:15 As they came from their mother's womb, so they shall go again, naked as they came; they shall take nothing for their toil, which they may carry away with their hands.
21Àü 5:16 This also is a grievous ill: just as they came, so shall they go; and what gain do they have from toiling for the wind?
21Àü 5:17 Besides, all their days they eat in darkness, in much vexation and sickness and resentment.
21Àü 5:18 This is what I have seen to be good: it is fitting to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of the life God gives us; for this is our lot.
21Àü 5:19 Likewise all to whom God gives wealth and possessions and whom he enables to enjoy them, and to accept their lot and find enjoyment in their toil--this is the gift of God.
21Àü 5:20 For they will scarcely brood over the days of their lives, because God keeps them occupied with the joy of their hearts.
21Àü 6:1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind:
21Àü 6:2 those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous ill.
21Àü 6:3 A man may beget a hundred children, and live many years; but however many are the days of his years, if he does not enjoy life's good things, or has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
21Àü 6:4 For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered;
21Àü 6:5 moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he.
21Àü 6:6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good--do not all go to one place?
21Àü 6:7 All human toil is for the mouth, yet the appetite is not satisfied.
21Àü 6:8 For what advantage have the wise over fools? And what do the poor have who know how to conduct themselves before the living?
21Àü 6:9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
21Àü 6:10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what human beings are, and that they are not able to dispute with those who are stronger.
21Àü 6:11 The more words, the more vanity, so how is one the better?
21Àü 6:12 For who knows what is good for mortals while they live the few days of their vain life, which they pass like a shadow? For who can tell them what will be after them under the sun?
21Àü 7:1 A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death, than the day of birth.
21Àü 7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for this is the end of everyone, and the living will lay it to heart.
21Àü 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of countenance the heart is made glad.
21Àü 7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
21Àü 7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
21Àü 7:6 For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools; this also is vanity.
21Àü 7:7 Surely oppression makes the wise foolish, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21Àü 7:8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; the patient in spirit are better than the proud in spirit.
21Àü 7:9 Do not be quick to anger, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools.
21Àü 7:10 Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.
21Àü 7:11 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.
21Àü 7:12 For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to the one who possesses it.
21Àü 7:13 Consider the work of God; who can make straight what he has made crooked?
21Àü 7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God has made the one as well as the other, so that mortals may not find out anything that will come after them.
21Àü 7:15 In my vain life I have seen everything; there are righteous people who perish in their righteousness, and there are wicked people who prolong their life in their evil-doing.
21Àü 7:16 Do not be too righteous, and do not act too wise; why should you destroy yourself?
21Àü 7:17 Do not be too wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time?
21Àü 7:18 It is good that you should take hold of the one, without letting go of the other; for the one who fears God shall succeed with both.
21Àü 7:19 Wisdom gives strength to the wise more than ten rulers that are in a city.
21Àü 7:20 Surely there is no one on earth so righteous as to do good without ever sinning.
21Àü 7:21 Do not give heed to everything that people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you;
21Àü 7:22 your heart knows that many times you have yourself cursed others.
21Àü 7:23 All this I have tested by wisdom; I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.
21Àü 7:24 That which is, is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?
21Àü 7:25 I turned my mind to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the sum of things, and to know that wickedness is folly and that foolishness is madness.
21Àü 7:26 I found more bitter than death the woman who is a trap, whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are fetters; one who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.
21Àü 7:27 See, this is what I found, says the Teacher, adding one thing to another to find the sum,
21Àü 7:28 which my mind has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
21Àü 7:29 See, this alone I found, that God made human beings straightforward, but they have devised many schemes.
21Àü 8:1 Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? Wisdom makes one's face shine, and the hardness of one's countenance is changed.
21Àü 8:2 Keep the king's command because of your sacred oath.
21Àü 8:3 Do not be terrified; go from his presence, do not delay when the matter is unpleasant, for he does whatever he pleases.
21Àü 8:4 For the word of the king is powerful, and who can say to him, "What are you doing?"
21Àü 8:5 Whoever obeys a command will meet no harm, and the wise mind will know the time and way.
21Àü 8:6 For every matter has its time and way, although the troubles of mortals lie heavy upon them.
21Àü 8:7 Indeed, they do not know what is to be, for who can tell them how it will be?
21Àü 8:8 No one has power over the wind to restrain the wind, or power over the day of death; there is no discharge from the battle, nor does wickedness deliver those who practice it.
21Àü 8:9 All this I observed, applying my mind to all that is done under the sun, while one person exercises authority over another to the other's hurt.
21Àü 8:10 Then I saw the wicked buried; they used to go in and out of the holy place, and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.
21Àü 8:11 Because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the human heart is fully set to do evil.
21Àü 8:12 Though sinners do evil a hundred times and prolong their lives, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they stand in fear before him,
21Àü 8:13 but it will not be well with the wicked, neither will they prolong their days like a shadow, because they do not stand in fear before God.
21Àü 8:14 There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people who are treated according to the conduct of the wicked, and there are wicked people who are treated according to the conduct of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
21Àü 8:15 So I commend enjoyment, for there is nothing better for people under the sun than to eat, and drink, and enjoy themselves, for this will go with them in their toil through the days of life that God gives them under the sun.
21Àü 8:16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how one's eyes see sleep neither day nor night,
21Àü 8:17 then I saw all the work of God, that no one can find out what is happening under the sun. However much they may toil in seeking, they will not find it out; even though those who are wise claim to know, they cannot find it out.
21Àü 9:1 All this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate one does not know. Everything that confronts them
21Àü 9:2 is vanity, since the same fate comes to all, to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to those who sacrifice and those who do not sacrifice. As are the good, so are the sinners; those who swear are like those who shun an oath.
21Àü 9:3 This is an evil in all that happens under the sun, that the same fate comes to everyone. Moreover, the hearts of all are full of evil; madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
21Àü 9:4 But whoever is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
21Àü 9:5 The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no more reward, and even the memory of them is lost.
21Àü 9:6 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished; never again will they have any share in all that happens under the sun.
21Àü 9:7 Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has long ago approved what you do.
21Àü 9:8 Let your garments always be white; do not let oil be lacking on your head.
21Àü 9:9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that are given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.
21Àü 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
21Àü 9:11 Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the skillful; but time and chance happen to them all.
21Àü 9:12 For no one can anticipate the time of disaster. Like fish taken in a cruel net, and like birds caught in a snare, so mortals are snared at a time of calamity, when it suddenly falls upon them.
21Àü 9:13 I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
21Àü 9:14 There was a little city with few people in it. A great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.
21Àü 9:15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
21Àü 9:16 So I said, "Wisdom is better than might; yet the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded."
21Àü 9:17 The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
21Àü 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one bungler destroys much good.
21Àü 10:1 Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a foul odor; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
21Àü 10:2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.
21Àü 10:3 Even when fools walk on the road, they lack sense, and show to everyone that they are fools.
21Àü 10:4 If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post, for calmness will undo great offenses.
21Àü 10:5 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as great an error as if it proceeded from the ruler:
21Àü 10:6 folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
21Àü 10:7 I have seen slaves on horseback, and princes walking on foot like slaves.
21Àü 10:8 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a snake.
21Àü 10:9 Whoever quarries stones will be hurt by them; and whoever splits logs will be endangered by them.
21Àü 10:10 If the iron is blunt, and one does not whet the edge, then more strength must be exerted; but wisdom helps one to succeed.
21Àü 10:11 If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage in a charmer.
21Àü 10:12 Words spoken by the wise bring them favor, but the lips of fools consume them.
21Àü 10:13 The words of their mouths begin in foolishness, and their talk ends in wicked madness;
21Àü 10:14 yet fools talk on and on. No one knows what is to happen, and who can tell anyone what the future holds?
21Àü 10:15 The toil of fools wears them out, for they do not even know the way to town.
21Àü 10:16 Alas for you, O land, when your king is a servant, and your princes feast in the morning!
21Àü 10:17 Happy are you, O land, when your king is a nobleman, and your princes feast at the proper time--for strength, and not for drunkenness!
21Àü 10:18 Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.
21Àü 10:19 Feasts are made for laughter; wine gladdens life, and money meets every need.
21Àü 10:20 Do not curse the king, even in your thoughts, or curse the rich, even in your bedroom; for a bird of the air may carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.
21Àü 11:1 Send out your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will get it back.
21Àü 11:2 Divide your means seven ways, or even eight, for you do not know what disaster may happen on earth.
21Àü 11:3 When clouds are full, they empty rain on the earth; whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
21Àü 11:4 Whoever observes the wind will not sow; and whoever regards the clouds will not reap.
21Àü 11:5 Just as you do not know how the breath comes to the bones in the mother's womb, so you do not know the work of God, who makes everything.
21Àü 11:6 In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not let your hands be idle; for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
21Àü 11:7 Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
21Àü 11:8 Even those who live many years should rejoice in them all; yet let them remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity.
21Àü 11:9 Rejoice, young man, while you are young, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Follow the inclination of your heart and the desire of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
21Àü 11:10 Banish anxiety from your mind, and put away pain from your body; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
21Àü 12:1 Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come, and the years draw near when you will say, "I have no pleasure in them";
21Àü 12:2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return with the rain;
21Àü 12:3 in the day when the guards of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the women who grind cease working because they are few, and those who look through the windows see dimly;
21Àü 12:4 when the doors on the street are shut, and the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;
21Àü 12:5 when one is afraid of heights, and terrors are in the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along and desire fails; because all must go to their eternal home, and the mourners will go about the streets;
21Àü 12:6 before the silver cord is snapped, and the golden bowl is broken, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the cistern,
21Àü 12:7 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the breath returns to God who gave it.
21Àü 12:8 Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher; all is vanity.
21Àü 12:9 Besides being wise, the Teacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs.
21Àü 12:10 The Teacher sought to find pleasing words, and he wrote words of truth plainly.
21Àü 12:11 The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings that are given by one shepherd.
21Àü 12:12 Of anything beyond these, my child, beware. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
21Àü 12:13 The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone.
21Àü 12:14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.

22¾Æ 1:1 The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
22¾Æ 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine,
22¾Æ 1:3 your anointing oils are fragrant, your name is perfume poured out; therefore the maidens love you.
22¾Æ 1:4 Draw me after you, let us make haste. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.
22¾Æ 1:5 I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
22¾Æ 1:6 Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has gazed on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!
22¾Æ 1:7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions?
22¾Æ 1:8 If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow the tracks of the flock, and pasture your kids beside the shepherds' tents.
22¾Æ 1:9 I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22¾Æ 1:10 Your cheeks are comely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
22¾Æ 1:11 We will make you ornaments of gold, studded with silver.
22¾Æ 1:12 While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance.
22¾Æ 1:13 My beloved is to me a bag of myrrh that lies between my breasts.
22¾Æ 1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.
22¾Æ 1:15 Ah, you are beautiful, my love; ah, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
22¾Æ 1:16 Ah, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly lovely. Our couch is green;
22¾Æ 1:17 the beams of our house are cedar, our rafters are pine.
22¾Æ 2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
22¾Æ 2:2 As a lily among brambles, so is my love among maidens.
22¾Æ 2:3 As an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
22¾Æ 2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his intention toward me was love.
22¾Æ 2:5 Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love.
22¾Æ 2:6 O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand embraced me!
22¾Æ 2:7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the wild does: do not stir up or awaken love until it is ready!
22¾Æ 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Look, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22¾Æ 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he stands behind our wall, gazing in at the windows, looking through the lattice.
22¾Æ 2:10 My beloved speaks and says to me: "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away;
22¾Æ 2:11 for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
22¾Æ 2:12 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
22¾Æ 2:13 The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
22¾Æ 2:14 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22¾Æ 2:15 Catch us the foxes, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards--for our vineyards are in blossom."
22¾Æ 2:16 My beloved is mine and I am his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
22¾Æ 2:17 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on the cleft mountains.
22¾Æ 3:1 Upon my bed at night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.
22¾Æ 3:2 "I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves." I sought him, but found him not.
22¾Æ 3:3 The sentinels found me, as they went about in the city. "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"
22¾Æ 3:4 Scarcely had I passed them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
22¾Æ 3:5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the wild does: do not stir up or awaken love until it is ready!
22¾Æ 3:6 What is that coming up from the wilderness, like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
22¾Æ 3:7 Look, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men of the mighty men of Israel,
22¾Æ 3:8 all equipped with swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh because of alarms by night.
22¾Æ 3:9 King Solomon made himself a palanquin from the wood of Lebanon.
22¾Æ 3:10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love. Daughters of Jerusalem,
22¾Æ 3:11 come out. Look, O daughters of Zion, at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.
22¾Æ 4:1 How beautiful you are, my love, how very beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes of Gilead.
22¾Æ 4:2 Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them is bereaved.
22¾Æ 4:3 Your lips are like a crimson thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
22¾Æ 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built in courses; on it hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors.
22¾Æ 4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.
22¾Æ 4:6 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will hasten to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
22¾Æ 4:7 You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.
22¾Æ 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
22¾Æ 4:9 You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, you have ravished my heart with a glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22¾Æ 4:10 How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! how much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!
22¾Æ 4:11 Your lips distill nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.
22¾Æ 4:12 A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a garden locked, a fountain sealed.
22¾Æ 4:13 Your channel is an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,
22¾Æ 4:14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices--
22¾Æ 4:15 a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
22¾Æ 4:16 Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden that its fragrance may be wafted abroad. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.
22¾Æ 5:1 I come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gather my myrrh with my spice, I eat my honeycomb with my honey, I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love.
22¾Æ 5:2 I slept, but my heart was awake. Listen! my beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."
22¾Æ 5:3 I had put off my garment; how could I put it on again? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?
22¾Æ 5:4 My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, and my inmost being yearned for him.
22¾Æ 5:5 I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.
22¾Æ 5:6 I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but did not find him; I called him, but he gave no answer.
22¾Æ 5:7 Making their rounds in the city the sentinels found me; they beat me, they wounded me, they took away my mantle, those sentinels of the walls.
22¾Æ 5:8 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, tell him this: I am faint with love.
22¾Æ 5:9 What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?
22¾Æ 5:10 My beloved is all radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
22¾Æ 5:11 His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.
22¾Æ 5:12 His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.
22¾Æ 5:13 His cheeks are like beds of spices, yielding fragrance. His lips are lilies, distilling liquid myrrh.
22¾Æ 5:14 His arms are rounded gold, set with jewels. His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.
22¾Æ 5:15 His legs are alabaster columns, set upon bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
22¾Æ 5:16 His speech is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
22¾Æ 6:1 Where has your beloved gone, O fairest among women? Which way has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
22¾Æ 6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
22¾Æ 6:3 I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
22¾Æ 6:4 You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
22¾Æ 6:5 Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me! Your hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes of Gilead.
22¾Æ 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins, and not one among them is bereaved.
22¾Æ 6:7 Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
22¾Æ 6:8 There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.
22¾Æ 6:9 My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the darling of her mother, flawless to her that bore her. The maidens saw her and called her happy; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.
22¾Æ 6:10 "Who is this that looks forth like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?"
22¾Æ 6:11 I went down to the nut orchard, to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
22¾Æ 6:12 Before I was aware, my fancy set me in a chariot beside my prince.
22¾Æ 6:13 Return, return, O Shulammite! Return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?
22¾Æ 7:1 How graceful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.
22¾Æ 7:2 Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.
22¾Æ 7:3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22¾Æ 7:4 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, overlooking Damascus.
22¾Æ 7:5 Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.
22¾Æ 7:6 How fair and pleasant you are, O loved one, delectable maiden!
22¾Æ 7:7 You are stately as a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.
22¾Æ 7:8 I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its branches. Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,
22¾Æ 7:9 and your kisses like the best wine that goes down smoothly, gliding over lips and teeth.
22¾Æ 7:10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.
22¾Æ 7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and lodge in the villages;
22¾Æ 7:12 let us go out early to the vineyards, and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
22¾Æ 7:13 The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
22¾Æ 8:1 O that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother's breast! If I met you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
22¾Æ 8:2 I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother, and into the chamber of the one who bore me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranates.
22¾Æ 8:3 O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand embraced me!
22¾Æ 8:4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir up or awaken love until it is ready!
22¾Æ 8:5 Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.
22¾Æ 8:6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame.
22¾Æ 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If one offered for love all the wealth of his house, it would be utterly scorned.
22¾Æ 8:8 We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister, on the day when she is spoken for?
22¾Æ 8:9 If she is a wall, we will build upon her a battlement of silver; but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
22¾Æ 8:10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who brings peace.
22¾Æ 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
22¾Æ 8:12 My vineyard, my very own, is for myself; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred!
22¾Æ 8:13 O you who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening for your voice; let me hear it.
22¾Æ 8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of spices!

23»ç 1:1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23»ç 1:2 Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
23»ç 1:3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib; but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.
23»ç 1:4 Ah, sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, offspring who do evil, children who deal corruptly, who have forsaken the LORD, who have despised the Holy One of Israel, who are utterly estranged!
23»ç 1:5 Why do you seek further beatings? Why do you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
23»ç 1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they have not been drained, or bound up, or softened with oil.
23»ç 1:7 Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.
23»ç 1:8 And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
23»ç 1:9 If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.
23»ç 1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23»ç 1:11 What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
23»ç 1:12 When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;
23»ç 1:13 bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation--I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.
23»ç 1:14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.
23»ç 1:15 When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.
23»ç 1:16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil,
23»ç 1:17 learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.
23»ç 1:18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
23»ç 1:19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;
23»ç 1:20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 1:21 How the faithful city has become a whore! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her--but now murderers!
23»ç 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.
23»ç 1:23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the orphan, and the widow's cause does not come before them.
23»ç 1:24 Therefore says the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will pour out my wrath on my enemies, and avenge myself on my foes!
23»ç 1:25 I will turn my hand against you; I will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.
23»ç 1:26 And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.
23»ç 1:27 Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
23»ç 1:28 But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
23»ç 1:29 For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.
23»ç 1:30 For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.
23»ç 1:31 The strong shall become like tinder, and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them.
23»ç 2:1 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
23»ç 2:2 In days to come the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.
23»ç 2:3 Many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23»ç 2:4 He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
23»ç 2:5 O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!
23»ç 2:6 For you have forsaken the ways of your people, O house of Jacob. Indeed they are full of diviners from the east and of soothsayers like the Philistines, and they clasp hands with foreigners.
23»ç 2:7 Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.
23»ç 2:8 Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
23»ç 2:9 And so people are humbled, and everyone is brought low--do not forgive them!
23»ç 2:10 Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty.
23»ç 2:11 The haughty eyes of people shall be brought low, and the pride of everyone shall be humbled; and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23»ç 2:12 For the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and high;
23»ç 2:13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
23»ç 2:14 against all the high mountains, and against all the lofty hills;
23»ç 2:15 against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
23»ç 2:16 against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
23»ç 2:17 The haughtiness of people shall be humbled, and the pride of everyone shall be brought low; and the LORD alone will be exalted on that day.
23»ç 2:18 The idols shall utterly pass away.
23»ç 2:19 Enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
23»ç 2:20 On that day people will throw away to the moles and to the bats their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship,
23»ç 2:21 to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts in the crags, from the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
23»ç 2:22 Turn away from mortals, who have only breath in their nostrils, for of what account are they?
23»ç 3:1 For now the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts, is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff--all support of bread, and all support of water--
23»ç 3:2 warrior and soldier, judge and prophet, diviner and elder,
23»ç 3:3 captain of fifty and dignitary, counselor and skillful magician and expert enchanter.
23»ç 3:4 And I will make boys their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
23»ç 3:5 The people will be oppressed, everyone by another and everyone by a neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the base to the honorable.
23»ç 3:6 Someone will even seize a relative, a member of the clan, saying, "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule."
23»ç 3:7 But the other will cry out on that day, saying, "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people."
23»ç 3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
23»ç 3:9 The look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
23»ç 3:10 Tell the innocent how fortunate they are, for they shall eat the fruit of their labors.
23»ç 3:11 Woe to the guilty! How unfortunate they are, for what their hands have done shall be done to them.
23»ç 3:12 My people--children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you, and confuse the course of your paths.
23»ç 3:13 The LORD rises to argue his case; he stands to judge the peoples.
23»ç 3:14 The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: It is you who have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
23»ç 3:15 What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.
23»ç 3:16 The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet;
23»ç 3:17 the Lord will afflict with scabs the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.
23»ç 3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
23»ç 3:19 the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarfs;
23»ç 3:20 the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
23»ç 3:21 the signet rings and nose rings;
23»ç 3:22 the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
23»ç 3:23 the garments of gauze, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
23»ç 3:24 Instead of perfume there will be a stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a binding of sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.
23»ç 3:25 Your men shall fall by the sword and your warriors in battle.
23»ç 3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; ravaged, she shall sit upon the ground.
23»ç 4:1 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes; just let us be called by your name; take away our disgrace."
23»ç 4:2 On that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.
23»ç 4:3 Whoever is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
23»ç 4:4 once the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
23»ç 4:5 Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over its places of assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night. Indeed over all the glory there will be a canopy.
23»ç 4:6 It will serve as a pavilion, a shade by day from the heat, and a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.
23»ç 5:1 Let me sing for my beloved my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
23»ç 5:2 He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.
23»ç 5:3 And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
23»ç 5:4 What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?
23»ç 5:5 And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.
23»ç 5:6 I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
23»ç 5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are his pleasant planting; he expected justice, but saw bloodshed; righteousness, but heard a cry!
23»ç 5:8 Ah, you who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is room for no one but you, and you are left to live alone in the midst of the land!
23»ç 5:9 The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
23»ç 5:10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield a mere ephah.
23»ç 5:11 Ah, you who rise early in the morning in pursuit of strong drink, who linger in the evening to be inflamed by wine,
23»ç 5:12 whose feasts consist of lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine, but who do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work of his hands!
23»ç 5:13 Therefore my people go into exile without knowledge; their nobles are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst.
23»ç 5:14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure; the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down, her throng and all who exult in her.
23»ç 5:15 People are bowed down, everyone is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.
23»ç 5:16 But the LORD of hosts is exalted by justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy by righteousness.
23»ç 5:17 Then the lambs shall graze as in their pasture, fatlings and kids shall feed among the ruins.
23»ç 5:18 Ah, you who drag iniquity along with cords of falsehood, who drag sin along as with cart ropes,
23»ç 5:19 who say, "Let him make haste, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the plan of the Holy One of Israel hasten to fulfillment, that we may know it!"
23»ç 5:20 Ah, you who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
23»ç 5:21 Ah, you who are wise in your own eyes, and shrewd in your own sight!
23»ç 5:22 Ah, you who are heroes in drinking wine and valiant at mixing drink,
23»ç 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of their rights!
23»ç 5:24 Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will become rotten, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 5:25 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them; the mountains quaked, and their corpses were like refuse in the streets. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
23»ç 5:26 He will raise a signal for a nation far away, and whistle for a people at the ends of the earth; Here they come, swiftly, speedily!
23»ç 5:27 None of them is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a loincloth is loose, not a sandal-thong broken;
23»ç 5:28 their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.
23»ç 5:29 Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey, they carry it off, and no one can rescue.
23»ç 5:30 They will roar over it on that day, like the roaring of the sea. And if one look to the land--only darkness and distress; and the light grows dark with clouds.
23»ç 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
23»ç 6:2 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.
23»ç 6:3 And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory."
23»ç 6:4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke.
23»ç 6:5 And I said: "Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"
23»ç 6:6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.
23»ç 6:7 The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: "Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out."
23»ç 6:8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I; send me!"
23»ç 6:9 And he said, "Go and say to this people: 'Keep listening, but do not comprehend; keep looking, but do not understand.'
23»ç 6:10 Make the mind of this people dull, and stop their ears, and shut their eyes, so that they may not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears, and comprehend with their minds, and turn and be healed."
23»ç 6:11 Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate;
23»ç 6:12 until the LORD sends everyone far away, and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.
23»ç 6:13 Even if a tenth part remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains standing when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.
23»ç 7:1 In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel went up to attack Jerusalem, but could not mount an attack against it.
23»ç 7:2 When the house of David heard that Aram had allied itself with Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
23»ç 7:3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field,
23»ç 7:4 and say to him, Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.
23»ç 7:5 Because Aram--with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah--has plotted evil against you, saying,
23»ç 7:6 Let us go up against Judah and cut off Jerusalem and conquer it for ourselves and make the son of Tabeel king in it;
23»ç 7:7 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
23»ç 7:8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. (Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a people.)
23»ç 7:9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in faith, you shall not stand at all.
23»ç 7:10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,
23»ç 7:11 Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.
23»ç 7:12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.
23»ç 7:13 Then Isaiah said: "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also?
23»ç 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.
23»ç 7:15 He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
23»ç 7:16 For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.
23»ç 7:17 The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on your ancestral house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--the king of Assyria."
23»ç 7:18 On that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the sources of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
23»ç 7:19 And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.
23»ç 7:20 On that day the Lord will shave with a razor hired beyond the River--with the king of Assyria--the head and the hair of the feet, and it will take off the beard as well.
23»ç 7:21 On that day one will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
23»ç 7:22 and will eat curds because of the abundance of milk that they give; for everyone that is left in the land shall eat curds and honey.
23»ç 7:23 On that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.
23»ç 7:24 With bow and arrows one will go there, for all the land will be briers and thorns;
23»ç 7:25 and as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
23»ç 8:1 Then the LORD said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, "Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz,"
23»ç 8:2 and have it attested for me by reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.
23»ç 8:3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
23»ç 8:4 for before the child knows how to call "My father" or "My mother," the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.
23»ç 8:5 The LORD spoke to me again:
23»ç 8:6 Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
23»ç 8:7 therefore, the Lord is bringing up against it the mighty flood waters of the River, the king of Assyria and all his glory; it will rise above all its channels and overflow all its banks;
23»ç 8:8 it will sweep on into Judah as a flood, and, pouring over, it will reach up to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
23»ç 8:9 Band together, you peoples, and be dismayed; listen, all you far countries; gird yourselves and be dismayed; gird yourselves and be dismayed!
23»ç 8:10 Take counsel together, but it shall be brought to naught; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
23»ç 8:11 For the LORD spoke thus to me while his hand was strong upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:
23»ç 8:12 Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what it fears, or be in dread.
23»ç 8:13 But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
23»ç 8:14 He will become a sanctuary, a stone one strikes against; for both houses of Israel he will become a rock one stumbles over--a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
23»ç 8:15 And many among them shall stumble; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.
23»ç 8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.
23»ç 8:17 I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
23»ç 8:18 See, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23»ç 8:19 Now if people say to you, "Consult the ghosts and the familiar spirits that chirp and mutter; should not a people consult their gods, the dead on behalf of the living,
23»ç 8:20 for teaching and for instruction?" Surely, those who speak like this will have no dawn!
23»ç 8:21 They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry; when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will curse their king and their gods. They will turn their faces upward,
23»ç 8:22 or they will look to the earth, but will see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into thick darkness.
23»ç 9:1 But there will be no gloom for those who were in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
23»ç 9:2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness--on them light has shined.
23»ç 9:3 You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as people exult when dividing plunder.
23»ç 9:4 For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
23»ç 9:5 For all the boots of the tramping warriors and all the garments rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.
23»ç 9:6 For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
23»ç 9:7 His authority shall grow continually, and there shall be endless peace for the throne of David and his kingdom. He will establish and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time onward and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
23»ç 9:8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel;
23»ç 9:9 and all the people knew it--Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria--but in pride and arrogance of heart they said:
23»ç 9:10 "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place."
23»ç 9:11 So the LORD raised adversaries against them, and stirred up their enemies,
23»ç 9:12 the Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west, and they devoured Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away; his hand is stretched out still.
23»ç 9:13 The people did not turn to him who struck them, or seek the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 9:14 So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day--
23»ç 9:15 elders and dignitaries are the head, and prophets who teach lies are the tail;
23»ç 9:16 for those who led this people led them astray, and those who were led by them were left in confusion.
23»ç 9:17 That is why the Lord did not have pity on their young people, or compassion on their orphans and widows; for everyone was godless and an evildoer, and every mouth spoke folly. For all this his anger has not turned away, his hand is stretched out still.
23»ç 9:18 For wickedness burned like a fire, consuming briers and thorns; it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they swirled upward in a column of smoke.
23»ç 9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land was burned, and the people became like fuel for the fire; no one spared another.
23»ç 9:20 They gorged on the right, but still were hungry, and they devoured on the left, but were not satisfied; they devoured the flesh of their own kindred;
23»ç 9:21 Manasseh devoured Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, and together they were against Judah. For all this his anger has not turned away; his hand is stretched out still.
23»ç 10:1 Ah, you who make iniquitous decrees, who write oppressive statutes,
23»ç 10:2 to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be your spoil, and that you may make the orphans your prey!
23»ç 10:3 What will you do on the day of punishment, in the calamity that will come from far away? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth,
23»ç 10:4 so as not to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain? For all this his anger has not turned away; his hand is stretched out still.
23»ç 10:5 Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger--the club in their hands is my fury!
23»ç 10:6 Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
23»ç 10:7 But this is not what he intends, nor does he have this in mind; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
23»ç 10:8 For he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?
23»ç 10:9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
23»ç 10:10 As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
23»ç 10:11 shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols what I have done to Samaria and her images?"
23»ç 10:12 When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the arrogant boasting of the king of Assyria and his haughty pride.
23»ç 10:13 For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and have plundered their treasures; like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.
23»ç 10:14 My hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing, or opened its mouth, or chirped."
23»ç 10:15 Shall the ax vaunt itself over the one who wields it, or the saw magnify itself against the one who handles it? As if a rod should raise the one who lifts it up, or as if a staff should lift the one who is not wood!
23»ç 10:16 Therefore the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.
23»ç 10:17 The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
23»ç 10:18 The glory of his forest and his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when an invalid wastes away.
23»ç 10:19 The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.
23»ç 10:20 On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on the one who struck them, but will lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
23»ç 10:21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
23»ç 10:22 For though your people Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
23»ç 10:23 For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in all the earth.
23»ç 10:24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: O my people, who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they beat you with a rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.
23»ç 10:25 For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.
23»ç 10:26 The LORD of hosts will wield a whip against them, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
23»ç 10:27 On that day his burden will be removed from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck. He has gone up from Rimmon,
23»ç 10:28 he has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron, at Michmash he stores his baggage;
23»ç 10:29 they have crossed over the pass, at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles, Gibeah of Saul has fled.
23»ç 10:30 Cry aloud, O daughter Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Answer her, O Anathoth!
23»ç 10:31 Madmenah is in flight, the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
23»ç 10:32 This very day he will halt at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mount of daughter Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
23»ç 10:33 Look, the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts, will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the tallest trees will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
23»ç 10:34 He will hack down the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.
23»ç 11:1 A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
23»ç 11:2 The spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
23»ç 11:3 His delight shall be in the fear of the LORD. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear;
23»ç 11:4 but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.
23»ç 11:5 Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.
23»ç 11:6 The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.
23»ç 11:7 The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
23»ç 11:8 The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder's den.
23»ç 11:9 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
23»ç 11:10 On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.
23»ç 11:11 On that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Ethiopia, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea.
23»ç 11:12 He will raise a signal for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
23»ç 11:13 The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, the hostility of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not be hostile towards Ephraim.
23»ç 11:14 But they shall swoop down on the backs of the Philistines in the west, together they shall plunder the people of the east. They shall put forth their hand against Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites shall obey them.
23»ç 11:15 And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt; and will wave his hand over the River with his scorching wind; and will split it into seven channels, and make a way to cross on foot;
23»ç 11:16 so there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant that is left of his people, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
23»ç 12:1 You will say in that day: I will give thanks to you, O LORD, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, and you comforted me.
23»ç 12:2 Surely God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid, for the LORD GOD is my strength and my might; he has become my salvation.
23»ç 12:3 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
23»ç 12:4 And you will say in that day: Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known his deeds among the nations; proclaim that his name is exalted.
23»ç 12:5 Sing praises to the LORD, for he has done gloriously; let this be known in all the earth.
23»ç 12:6 Shout aloud and sing for joy, O royal Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 13:1 The oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw.
23»ç 13:2 On a bare hill raise a signal, cry aloud to them; wave the hand for them to enter the gates of the nobles.
23»ç 13:3 I myself have commanded my consecrated ones, have summoned my warriors, my proudly exulting ones, to execute my anger.
23»ç 13:4 Listen, a tumult on the mountains as of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathering together! The LORD of hosts is mustering an army for battle.
23»ç 13:5 They come from a distant land, from the end of the heavens, the LORD and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole earth.
23»ç 13:6 Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty!
23»ç 13:7 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and every human heart will melt,
23»ç 13:8 and they will be dismayed. Pangs and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at one another; their faces will be aflame.
23»ç 13:9 See, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the earth a desolation, and to destroy its sinners from it.
23»ç 13:10 For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light.
23»ç 13:11 I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant, and lay low the insolence of tyrants.
23»ç 13:12 I will make mortals more rare than fine gold, and humans than the gold of Ophir.
23»ç 13:13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place, at the wrath of the LORD of hosts in the day of his fierce anger.
23»ç 13:14 Like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with no one to gather them, all will turn to their own people, and all will flee to their own lands.
23»ç 13:15 Whoever is found will be thrust through, and whoever is caught will fall by the sword.
23»ç 13:16 Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered, and their wives ravished.
23»ç 13:17 See, I am stirring up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold.
23»ç 13:18 Their bows will slaughter the young men; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not pity children.
23»ç 13:19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor and pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.
23»ç 13:20 It will never be inhabited or lived in for all generations; Arabs will not pitch their tents there, shepherds will not make their flocks lie down there.
23»ç 13:21 But wild animals will lie down there, and its houses will be full of howling creatures; there ostriches will live, and there goat-demons will dance.
23»ç 13:22 Hyenas will cry in its towers, and jackals in the pleasant palaces; its time is close at hand, and its days will not be prolonged.
23»ç 14:1 But the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and will set them in their own land; and aliens will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
23»ç 14:2 And the nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess the nations as male and female slaves in the LORD's land; they will take captive those who were their captors, and rule over those who oppressed them.
23»ç 14:3 When the LORD has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve,
23»ç 14:4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has ceased! How his insolence has ceased!
23»ç 14:5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of rulers,
23»ç 14:6 that struck down the peoples in wrath with unceasing blows, that ruled the nations in anger with unrelenting persecution.
23»ç 14:7 The whole earth is at rest and quiet; they break forth into singing.
23»ç 14:8 The cypresses exult over you, the cedars of Lebanon, saying, "Since you were laid low, no one comes to cut us down."
23»ç 14:9 Sheol beneath is stirred up to meet you when you come; it rouses the shades to greet you, all who were leaders of the earth; it raises from their thrones all who were kings of the nations.
23»ç 14:10 All of them will speak and say to you: "You too have become as weak as we! You have become like us!"
23»ç 14:11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, and the sound of your harps; maggots are the bed beneath you, and worms are your covering.
23»ç 14:12 How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low!
23»ç 14:13 You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon;
23»ç 14:14 I will ascend to the tops of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High."
23»ç 14:15 But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.
23»ç 14:16 Those who see you will stare at you, and ponder over you: "Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms,
23»ç 14:17 who made the world like a desert and overthrew its cities, who would not let his prisoners go home?"
23»ç 14:18 All the kings of the nations lie in glory, each in his own tomb;
23»ç 14:19 but you are cast out, away from your grave, like loathsome carrion, clothed with the dead, those pierced by the sword, who go down to the stones of the Pit, like a corpse trampled underfoot.
23»ç 14:20 You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have killed your people. May the descendants of evildoers nevermore be named!
23»ç 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of their father. Let them never rise to possess the earth or cover the face of the world with cities.
23»ç 14:22 I will rise up against them, says the LORD of hosts, and will cut off from Babylon name and remnant, offspring and posterity, says the LORD.
23»ç 14:23 And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 14:24 The LORD of hosts has sworn: As I have designed, so shall it be; and as I have planned, so shall it come to pass:
23»ç 14:25 I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains trample him under foot; his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden from their shoulders.
23»ç 14:26 This is the plan that is planned concerning the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
23»ç 14:27 For the LORD of hosts has planned, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?
23»ç 14:28 In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came:
23»ç 14:29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken, for from the root of the snake will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying fiery serpent.
23»ç 14:30 The firstborn of the poor will graze, and the needy lie down in safety; but I will make your root die of famine, and your remnant I will kill.
23»ç 14:31 Wail, O gate; cry, O city; melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you! For smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in its ranks.
23»ç 14:32 What will one answer the messengers of the nation? "The LORD has founded Zion, and the needy among his people will find refuge in her."
23»ç 15:1 An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone; because Kir is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone.
23»ç 15:2 Dibon has gone up to the temple, to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. On every head is baldness, every beard is shorn;
23»ç 15:3 in the streets they bind on sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears.
23»ç 15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the loins of Moab quiver; his soul trembles.
23»ç 15:5 My heart cries out for Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction;
23»ç 15:6 the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the new growth fails, the verdure is no more.
23»ç 15:7 Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Wadi of the Willows.
23»ç 15:8 For a cry has gone around the land of Moab; the wailing reaches to Eglaim, the wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
23»ç 15:9 For the waters of Dibon are full of blood; yet I will bring upon Dibon even more--a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land.
23»ç 16:1 Send lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela, by way of the desert, to the mount of daughter Zion.
23»ç 16:2 Like fluttering birds, like scattered nestlings, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
23»ç 16:3 "Give counsel, grant justice; make your shade like night at the height of noon; hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive;
23»ç 16:4 let the outcasts of Moab settle among you; be a refuge to them from the destroyer." When the oppressor is no more, and destruction has ceased, and marauders have vanished from the land,
23»ç 16:5 then a throne shall be established in steadfast love in the tent of David, and on it shall sit in faithfulness a ruler who seeks justice and is swift to do what is right.
23»ç 16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab--how proud he is!--of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence; his boasts are false.
23»ç 16:7 Therefore let Moab wail, let everyone wail for Moab. Mourn, utterly stricken, for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth.
23»ç 16:8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vines of Sibmah, whose clusters once made drunk the lords of the nations, reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert; their shoots once spread abroad and crossed over the sea.
23»ç 16:9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vines of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shout over your fruit harvest and your grain harvest has ceased.
23»ç 16:10 Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field; and in the vineyards no songs are sung, no shouts are raised; no treader treads out wine in the presses; the vintage-shout is hushed.
23»ç 16:11 Therefore my heart throbs like a harp for Moab, and my very soul for Kir-heres.
23»ç 16:12 When Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
23»ç 16:13 This was the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past.
23»ç 16:14 But now the LORD says, In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all its great multitude; and those who survive will be very few and feeble.
23»ç 17:1 An oracle concerning Damascus. See, Damascus will cease to be a city, and will become a heap of ruins.
23»ç 17:2 Her towns will be deserted forever; they will be places for flocks, which will lie down, and no one will make them afraid.
23»ç 17:3 The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel, says the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 17:4 On that day the glory of Jacob will be brought low, and the fat of his flesh will grow lean.
23»ç 17:5 And it shall be as when reapers gather standing grain and their arms harvest the ears, and as when one gleans the ears of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
23»ç 17:6 Gleanings will be left in it, as when an olive tree is beaten--two or three berries in the top of the highest bough, four or five on the branches of a fruit tree, says the LORD God of Israel.
23»ç 17:7 On that day people will regard their Maker, and their eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel;
23»ç 17:8 they will not have regard for the altars, the work of their hands, and they will not look to what their own fingers have made, either the sacred poles or the altars of incense.
23»ç 17:9 On that day their strong cities will be like the deserted places of the Hivites and the Amorites, which they deserted because of the children of Israel, and there will be desolation.
23»ç 17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge; therefore, though you plant pleasant plants and set out slips of an alien god,
23»ç 17:11 though you make them grow on the day that you plant them, and make them blossom in the morning that you sow; yet the harvest will flee away in a day of grief and incurable pain.
23»ç 17:12 Ah, the thunder of many peoples, they thunder like the thundering of the sea! Ah, the roar of nations, they roar like the roaring of mighty waters!
23»ç 17:13 The nations roar like the roaring of many waters, but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind and whirling dust before the storm.
23»ç 17:14 At evening time, lo, terror! Before morning, they are no more. This is the fate of those who despoil us, and the lot of those who plunder us.
23»ç 18:1 Ah, land of whirring wings beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,
23»ç 18:2 sending ambassadors by the Nile in vessels of papyrus on the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide.
23»ç 18:3 All you inhabitants of the world, you who live on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet is blown, listen!
23»ç 18:4 For thus the LORD said to me: I will quietly look from my dwelling like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
23»ç 18:5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches he will hew away.
23»ç 18:6 They shall all be left to the birds of prey of the mountains and to the animals of the earth. And the birds of prey will summer on them, and all the animals of the earth will winter on them.
23»ç 18:7 At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people tall and smooth, from a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide, to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 19:1 An oracle concerning Egypt. See, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
23»ç 19:2 I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, one against the other, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
23»ç 19:3 the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out, and I will confound their plans; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead and the ghosts and the familiar spirits;
23»ç 19:4 I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master; a fierce king will rule over them, says the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 19:5 The waters of the Nile will be dried up, and the river will be parched and dry;
23»ç 19:6 its canals will become foul, and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up, reeds and rushes will rot away.
23»ç 19:7 There will be bare places by the Nile, on the brink of the Nile; and all that is sown by the Nile will dry up, be driven away, and be no more.
23»ç 19:8 Those who fish will mourn; all who cast hooks in the Nile will lament, and those who spread nets on the water will languish.
23»ç 19:9 The workers in flax will be in despair, and the carders and those at the loom will grow pale.
23»ç 19:10 Its weavers will be dismayed, and all who work for wages will be grieved.
23»ç 19:11 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the sages, a descendant of ancient kings"?
23»ç 19:12 Where now are your sages? Let them tell you and make known what the LORD of hosts has planned against Egypt.
23»ç 19:13 The princes of Zoan have become fools, and the princes of Memphis are deluded; those who are the cornerstones of its tribes have led Egypt astray.
23»ç 19:14 The LORD has poured into them a spirit of confusion; and they have made Egypt stagger in all its doings as a drunkard staggers around in vomit.
23»ç 19:15 Neither head nor tail, palm branch or reed, will be able to do anything for Egypt.
23»ç 19:16 On that day the Egyptians will be like women, and tremble with fear before the hand that the LORD of hosts raises against them.
23»ç 19:17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the plan that the LORD of hosts is planning against them.
23»ç 19:18 On that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of the Sun.
23»ç 19:19 On that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the center of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.
23»ç 19:20 It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry to the LORD because of oppressors, he will send them a savior, and will defend and deliver them.
23»ç 19:21 The LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians; and the Egyptians will know the LORD on that day, and will worship with sacrifice and burnt offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.
23»ç 19:22 The LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing; they will return to the LORD, and he will listen to their supplications and heal them.
23»ç 19:23 On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
23»ç 19:24 On that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
23»ç 19:25 whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my heritage."
23»ç 20:1 In the year that the commander-in-chief, who was sent by King Sargon of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against it and took it--
23»ç 20:2 at that time the LORD had spoken to Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, "Go, and loose the sackcloth from your loins and take your sandals off your feet," and he had done so, walking naked and barefoot.
23»ç 20:3 Then the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Ethiopia,
23»ç 20:4 so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians as captives and the Ethiopians as exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
23»ç 20:5 And they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their hope and of Egypt their boast.
23»ç 20:6 In that day the inhabitants of this coastland will say, 'See, this is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and to whom we fled for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! And we, how shall we escape?'"
23»ç 21:1 The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on, it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.
23»ç 21:2 A stern vision is told to me; the betrayer betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam, lay siege, O Media; all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.
23»ç 21:3 Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labor; I am bowed down so that I cannot hear, I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
23»ç 21:4 My mind reels, horror has appalled me; the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
23»ç 21:5 They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Rise up, commanders, oil the shield!
23»ç 21:6 For thus the Lord said to me: "Go, post a lookout, let him announce what he sees.
23»ç 21:7 When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him listen diligently, very diligently."
23»ç 21:8 Then the watcher called out: "Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed throughout the night.
23»ç 21:9 Look, there they come, riders, horsemen in pairs!" Then he responded, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground."
23»ç 21:10 O my threshed and winnowed one, what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you.
23»ç 21:11 The oracle concerning Dumah. One is calling to me from Seir, "Sentinel, what of the night? Sentinel, what of the night?"
23»ç 21:12 The sentinel says: "Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again."
23»ç 21:13 The oracle concerning the desert plain. In the scrub of the desert plain you will lodge, O caravans of Dedanites.
23»ç 21:14 Bring water to the thirsty, meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
23»ç 21:15 For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the stress of battle.
23»ç 21:16 For thus the Lord said to me: Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end;
23»ç 21:17 and the remaining bows of Kedar's warriors will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
23»ç 22:1 The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What do you mean that you have gone up, all of you, to the housetops,
23»ç 22:2 you that are full of shoutings, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain by the sword, nor are they dead in battle.
23»ç 22:3 Your rulers have all fled together; they were captured without the use of a bow. All of you who were found were captured, though they had fled far away.
23»ç 22:4 Therefore I said: Look away from me, let me weep bitter tears; do not try to comfort me for the destruction of my beloved people.
23»ç 22:5 For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a battering down of walls and a cry for help to the mountains.
23»ç 22:6 Elam bore the quiver with chariots and cavalry, and Kir uncovered the shield.
23»ç 22:7 Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the cavalry took their stand at the gates.
23»ç 22:8 He has taken away the covering of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest,
23»ç 22:9 and you saw that there were many breaches in the city of David, and you collected the waters of the lower pool.
23»ç 22:10 You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
23»ç 22:11 You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or have regard for him who planned it long ago.
23»ç 22:12 In that day the Lord GOD of hosts called to weeping and mourning, to baldness and putting on sackcloth;
23»ç 22:13 but instead there was joy and festivity, killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, eating meat and drinking wine. "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
23»ç 22:14 The LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die, says the Lord GOD of hosts.
23»ç 22:15 Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is master of the household, and say to him:
23»ç 22:16 What right do you have here? Who are your relatives here, that you have cut out a tomb here for yourself, cutting a tomb on the height, and carving a habitation for yourself in the rock?
23»ç 22:17 The LORD is about to hurl you away violently, my fellow. He will seize firm hold on you,
23»ç 22:18 whirl you round and round, and throw you like a ball into a wide land; there you shall die, and there your splendid chariots shall lie, O you disgrace to your master's house!
23»ç 22:19 I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your post.
23»ç 22:20 On that day I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah,
23»ç 22:21 and will clothe him with your robe and bind your sash on him. I will commit your authority to his hand, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
23»ç 22:22 I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and no one shall shut; he shall shut, and no one shall open.
23»ç 22:23 I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his ancestral house.
23»ç 22:24 And they will hang on him the whole weight of his ancestral house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.
23»ç 22:25 On that day, says the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way; it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will perish, for the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 23:1 The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your fortress is destroyed. When they came in from Cyprus they learned of it.
23»ç 23:2 Be still, O inhabitants of the coast, O merchants of Sidon, your messengers crossed over the sea
23»ç 23:3 and were on the mighty waters; your revenue was the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile; you were the merchant of the nations.
23»ç 23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the fortress of the sea, saying: "I have neither labored nor given birth, I have neither reared young men nor brought up young women."
23»ç 23:5 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish over the report about Tyre.
23»ç 23:6 Cross over to Tarshish--wail, O inhabitants of the coast!
23»ç 23:7 Is this your exultant city whose origin is from days of old, whose feet carried her to settle far away?
23»ç 23:8 Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
23»ç 23:9 The LORD of hosts has planned it--to defile the pride of all glory, to shame all the honored of the earth.
23»ç 23:10 Cross over to your own land, O ships of Tarshish; this is a harbor no more.
23»ç 23:11 He has stretched out his hand over the sea, he has shaken the kingdoms; the LORD has given command concerning Canaan to destroy its fortresses.
23»ç 23:12 He said: You will exult no longer, O oppressed virgin daughter Sidon; rise, cross over to Cyprus--even there you will have no rest.
23»ç 23:13 Look at the land of the Chaldeans! This is the people; it was not Assyria. They destined Tyre for wild animals. They erected their siege towers, they tore down her palaces, they made her a ruin.
23»ç 23:14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your fortress is destroyed.
23»ç 23:15 From that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the lifetime of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song about the prostitute:
23»ç 23:16 Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute! Make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.
23»ç 23:17 At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her trade, and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23»ç 23:18 Her merchandise and her wages will be dedicated to the LORD; her profits will not be stored or hoarded, but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who live in the presence of the LORD.
23»ç 24:1 Now the LORD is about to lay waste the earth and make it desolate, and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
23»ç 24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
23»ç 24:3 The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly despoiled; for the LORD has spoken this word.
23»ç 24:4 The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers; the heavens languish together with the earth.
23»ç 24:5 The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.
23»ç 24:6 Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt; therefore the inhabitants of the earth dwindled, and few people are left.
23»ç 24:7 The wine dries up, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.
23»ç 24:8 The mirth of the timbrels is stilled, the noise of the jubilant has ceased, the mirth of the lyre is stilled.
23»ç 24:9 No longer do they drink wine with singing; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
23»ç 24:10 The city of chaos is broken down, every house is shut up so that no one can enter.
23»ç 24:11 There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine; all joy has reached its eventide; the gladness of the earth is banished.
23»ç 24:12 Desolation is left in the city, the gates are battered into ruins.
23»ç 24:13 For thus it shall be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is ended.
23»ç 24:14 They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; they shout from the west over the majesty of the LORD.
23»ç 24:15 Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea glorify the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23»ç 24:16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! For the treacherous deal treacherously, the treacherous deal very treacherously.
23»ç 24:17 Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
23»ç 24:18 Whoever flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit; and whoever climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
23»ç 24:19 The earth is utterly broken, the earth is torn asunder, the earth is violently shaken.
23»ç 24:20 The earth staggers like a drunkard, it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.
23»ç 24:21 On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and on earth the kings of the earth.
23»ç 24:22 They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.
23»ç 24:23 Then the moon will be abashed, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders he will manifest his glory.
23»ç 25:1 O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name; for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
23»ç 25:2 For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; the palace of aliens is a city no more, it will never be rebuilt.
23»ç 25:3 Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; cities of ruthless nations will fear you.
23»ç 25:4 For you have been a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in their distress, a shelter from the rainstorm and a shade from the heat. When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rainstorm,
23»ç 25:5 the noise of aliens like heat in a dry place, you subdued the heat with the shade of clouds; the song of the ruthless was stilled.
23»ç 25:6 On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear.
23»ç 25:7 And he will destroy on this mountain the shroud that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever.
23»ç 25:8 Then the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 25:9 It will be said on that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
23»ç 25:10 For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. The Moabites shall be trodden down in their place as straw is trodden down in a dung-pit.
23»ç 25:11 Though they spread out their hands in the midst of it, as swimmers spread out their hands to swim, their pride will be laid low despite the struggle of their hands.
23»ç 25:12 The high fortifications of his walls will be brought down, laid low, cast to the ground, even to the dust.
23»ç 26:1 On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; he sets up victory like walls and bulwarks.
23»ç 26:2 Open the gates, so that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.
23»ç 26:3 Those of steadfast mind you keep in peace--in peace because they trust in you.
23»ç 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever, for in the LORD GOD you have an everlasting rock.
23»ç 26:5 For he has brought low the inhabitants of the height; the lofty city he lays low. He lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.
23»ç 26:6 The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
23»ç 26:7 The way of the righteous is level; O Just One, you make smooth the path of the righteous.
23»ç 26:8 In the path of your judgments, O LORD, we wait for you; your name and your renown are the soul's desire.
23»ç 26:9 My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
23»ç 26:10 If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the LORD.
23»ç 26:11 O LORD, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed. Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.
23»ç 26:12 O LORD, you will ordain peace for us, for indeed, all that we have done, you have done for us.
23»ç 26:13 O LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but we acknowledge your name alone.
23»ç 26:14 The dead do not live; shades do not rise--because you have punished and destroyed them, and wiped out all memory of them.
23»ç 26:15 But you have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.
23»ç 26:16 O LORD, in distress they sought you, they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
23»ç 26:17 Like a woman with child, who writhes and cries out in her pangs when she is near her time, so were we because of you, O LORD;
23»ç 26:18 we were with child, we writhed, but we gave birth only to wind. We have won no victories on earth, and no one is born to inhabit the world.
23»ç 26:19 Your dead shall live, their corpses shall rise. O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a radiant dew, and the earth will give birth to those long dead.
23»ç 26:20 Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the wrath is past.
23»ç 26:21 For the LORD comes out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no longer cover its slain.
23»ç 27:1 On that day the LORD with his cruel and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.
23»ç 27:2 On that day: A pleasant vineyard, sing about it!
23»ç 27:3 I, the LORD, am its keeper; every moment I water it. I guard it night and day so that no one can harm it;
23»ç 27:4 I have no wrath. If it gives me thorns and briers, I will march to battle against it. I will burn it up.
23»ç 27:5 Or else let it cling to me for protection, let it make peace with me, let it make peace with me.
23»ç 27:6 In days to come Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots, and fill the whole world with fruit.
23»ç 27:7 Has he struck them down as he struck down those who struck them? Or have they been killed as their killers were killed?
23»ç 27:8 By expulsion, by exile you struggled against them; with his fierce blast he removed them in the day of the east wind.
23»ç 27:9 Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be expiated, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces, no sacred poles or incense altars will remain standing.
23»ç 27:10 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; the calves graze there, there they lie down, and strip its branches.
23»ç 27:11 When its boughs are dry, they are broken; women come and make a fire of them. For this is a people without understanding; therefore he that made them will not have compassion on them, he that formed them will show them no favor.
23»ç 27:12 On that day the LORD will thresh from the channel of the Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one, O people of Israel.
23»ç 27:13 And on that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
23»ç 28:1 Ah, the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of those bloated with rich food, of those overcome with wine!
23»ç 28:2 See, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters; with his hand he will hurl them down to the earth.
23»ç 28:3 Trampled under foot will be the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim.
23»ç 28:4 And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of those bloated with rich food, will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer; whoever sees it, eats it up as soon as it comes to hand.
23»ç 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will be a garland of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people;
23»ç 28:6 and a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
23»ç 28:7 These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are confused with wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in giving judgment.
23»ç 28:8 All tables are covered with filthy vomit; no place is clean.
23»ç 28:9 "Whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from milk, those taken from the breast?
23»ç 28:10 For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little."
23»ç 28:11 Truly, with stammering lip and with alien tongue he will speak to this people,
23»ç 28:12 to whom he has said, "This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose"; yet they would not hear.
23»ç 28:13 Therefore the word of the LORD will be to them, "Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little;" in order that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
23»ç 28:14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
23»ç 28:15 Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have an agreement; when the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter";
23»ç 28:16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, See, I am laying in Zion a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: "One who trusts will not panic."
23»ç 28:17 And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the shelter.
23»ç 28:18 Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through you will be beaten down by it.
23»ç 28:19 As often as it passes through, it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
23»ç 28:20 For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.
23»ç 28:21 For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim, he will rage as in the valley of Gibeon; to do his deed--strange is his deed! and to work his work--alien is his work!
23»ç 28:22 Now therefore do not scoff, or your bonds will be made stronger; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts upon the whole land.
23»ç 28:23 Listen, and hear my voice; Pay attention, and hear my speech.
23»ç 28:24 Do those who plow for sowing plow continually? Do they continually open and harrow their ground?
23»ç 28:25 When they have leveled its surface, do they not scatter dill, sow cummin, and plant wheat in rows and barley in its proper place, and spelt as the border?
23»ç 28:26 For they are well instructed; their God teaches them.
23»ç 28:27 Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cummin with a rod.
23»ç 28:28 Grain is crushed for bread, but one does not thresh it forever; one drives the cart wheel and horses over it, but does not pulverize it.
23»ç 28:29 This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
23»ç 29:1 Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the festivals run their round.
23»ç 29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and Jerusalem shall be to me like an Ariel.
23»ç 29:3 And like David I will encamp against you; I will besiege you with towers and raise siegeworks against you.
23»ç 29:4 Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
23»ç 29:5 But the multitude of your foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of tyrants like flying chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,
23»ç 29:6 you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
23»ç 29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
23»ç 29:8 Just as when a hungry person dreams of eating and wakes up still hungry, or a thirsty person dreams of drinking and wakes up faint, still thirsty, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
23»ç 29:9 Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor, blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not from wine; stagger, but not from strong drink!
23»ç 29:10 For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep; he has closed your eyes, you prophets, and covered your heads, you seers.
23»ç 29:11 The vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to those who can read, with the command, "Read this," they say, "We cannot, for it is sealed."
23»ç 29:12 And if it is given to those who cannot read, saying, "Read this," they say, "We cannot read."
23»ç 29:13 The Lord said: Because these people draw near with their mouths and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their worship of me is a human commandment learned by rote;
23»ç 29:14 so I will again do amazing things with this people, shocking and amazing. The wisdom of their wise shall perish, and the discernment of the discerning shall be hidden.
23»ç 29:15 Ha! You who hide a plan too deep for the LORD, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
23»ç 29:16 You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay? Shall the thing made say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of the one who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
23»ç 29:17 Shall not Lebanon in a very little while become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be regarded as a forest?
23»ç 29:18 On that day the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
23»ç 29:19 The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the neediest people shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 29:20 For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall cease to be; all those alert to do evil shall be cut off--
23»ç 29:21 those who cause a person to lose a lawsuit, who set a trap for the arbiter in the gate, and without grounds deny justice to the one in the right.
23»ç 29:22 Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: No longer shall Jacob be ashamed, no longer shall his face grow pale.
23»ç 29:23 For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23»ç 29:24 And those who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction.
23»ç 30:1 Oh, rebellious children, says the LORD, who carry out a plan, but not mine; who make an alliance, but against my will, adding sin to sin;
23»ç 30:2 who set out to go down to Egypt without asking for my counsel, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh, and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt;
23»ç 30:3 Therefore the protection of Pharaoh shall become your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt your humiliation.
23»ç 30:4 For though his officials are at Zoan and his envoys reach Hanes,
23»ç 30:5 everyone comes to shame through a people that cannot profit them, that brings neither help nor profit, but shame and disgrace.
23»ç 30:6 An oracle concerning the animals of the Negeb. Through a land of trouble and distress, of lioness and roaring lion, of viper and flying serpent, they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.
23»ç 30:7 For Egypt's help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her, "Rahab who sits still."
23»ç 30:8 Go now, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, so that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever.
23»ç 30:9 For they are a rebellious people, faithless children, children who will not hear the instruction of the LORD;
23»ç 30:10 who say to the seers, "Do not see"; and to the prophets, "Do not prophesy to us what is right; speak to us smooth things, prophesy illusions,
23»ç 30:11 leave the way, turn aside from the path, let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
23»ç 30:12 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel: Because you reject this word, and put your trust in oppression and deceit, and rely on them;
23»ç 30:13 therefore this iniquity shall become for you like a break in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse, whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant;
23»ç 30:14 its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel that is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a sherd is found for taking fire from the hearth, or dipping water out of the cistern.
23»ç 30:15 For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength. But you refused
23»ç 30:16 and said, "No! We will flee upon horses"--therefore you shall flee! and, "We will ride upon swift steeds"--therefore your pursuers shall be swift!
23»ç 30:17 A thousand shall flee at the threat of one, at the threat of five you shall flee, until you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, like a signal on a hill.
23»ç 30:18 Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show mercy to you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.
23»ç 30:19 Truly, O people in Zion, inhabitants of Jerusalem, you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you.
23»ç 30:20 Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.
23»ç 30:21 And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."
23»ç 30:22 Then you will defile your silver-covered idols and your gold-plated images. You will scatter them like filthy rags; you will say to them, "Away with you!"
23»ç 30:23 He will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and grain, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. On that day your cattle will graze in broad pastures;
23»ç 30:24 and the oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat silage, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
23»ç 30:25 On every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water--on a day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
23»ç 30:26 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when the LORD binds up the injuries of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
23»ç 30:27 See, the name of the LORD comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire;
23»ç 30:28 his breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck--to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads them astray.
23»ç 30:29 You shall have a song as in the night when a holy festival is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23»ç 30:30 And the LORD will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and tempest and hailstones.
23»ç 30:31 The Assyrian will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, when he strikes with his rod.
23»ç 30:32 And every stroke of the staff of punishment that the LORD lays upon him will be to the sound of timbrels and lyres; battling with brandished arm he will fight with him.
23»ç 30:33 For his burning place has long been prepared; truly it is made ready for the king, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
23»ç 31:1 Alas for those who go down to Egypt for help and who rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult the LORD!
23»ç 31:2 Yet he too is wise and brings disaster; he does not call back his words, but will rise against the house of the evildoers, and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.
23»ç 31:3 The Egyptians are human, and not God; their horses are flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD stretches out his hand, the helper will stumble, and the one helped will fall, and they will all perish together.
23»ç 31:4 For thus the LORD said to me, As a lion or a young lion growls over its prey, and--when a band of shepherds is called out against it--is not terrified by their shouting or daunted at their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill.
23»ç 31:5 Like birds hovering overhead, so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it, he will spare and rescue it.
23»ç 31:6 Turn back to him whom you have deeply betrayed, O people of Israel.
23»ç 31:7 For on that day all of you shall throw away your idols of silver and idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
23»ç 31:8 "Then the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of mortals; and a sword, not of humans, shall devour him; he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
23»ç 31:9 His rock shall pass away in terror, and his officers desert the standard in panic," says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23»ç 32:1 See, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.
23»ç 32:2 Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
23»ç 32:3 Then the eyes of those who have sight will not be closed, and the ears of those who have hearing will listen.
23»ç 32:4 The minds of the rash will have good judgment, and the tongues of stammerers will speak readily and distinctly.
23»ç 32:5 A fool will no longer be called noble, nor a villain said to be honorable.
23»ç 32:6 For fools speak folly, and their minds plot iniquity: to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
23»ç 32:7 The villainies of villains are evil; they devise wicked devices to ruin the poor with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is right.
23»ç 32:8 But those who are noble plan noble things, and by noble things they stand.
23»ç 32:9 Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice; you complacent daughters, listen to my speech.
23»ç 32:10 In little more than a year you will shudder, you complacent ones; for the vintage will fail, the fruit harvest will not come.
23»ç 32:11 Tremble, you women who are at ease, shudder, you complacent ones; strip, and make yourselves bare, and put sackcloth on your loins.
23»ç 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
23»ç 32:13 for the soil of my people growing up in thorns and briers; yes, for all the joyous houses in the jubilant city.
23»ç 32:14 For the palace will be forsaken, the populous city deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become dens forever, the joy of wild asses, a pasture for flocks;
23»ç 32:15 until a spirit from on high is poured out on us, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
23»ç 32:16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
23»ç 32:17 The effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.
23»ç 32:18 My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
23»ç 32:19 The forest will disappear completely, and the city will be utterly laid low.
23»ç 32:20 Happy will you be who sow beside every stream, who let the ox and the donkey range freely.
23»ç 33:1 Ah, you destroyer, who yourself have not been destroyed; you treacherous one, with whom no one has dealt treacherously! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have stopped dealing treacherously, you will be dealt with treacherously.
23»ç 33:2 O LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for you. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.
23»ç 33:3 At the sound of tumult, peoples fled; before your majesty, nations scattered.
23»ç 33:4 Spoil was gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, they leaped upon it.
23»ç 33:5 The LORD is exalted, he dwells on high; he filled Zion with justice and righteousness;
23»ç 33:6 he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.
23»ç 33:7 Listen! the valiant cry in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
23»ç 33:8 The highways are deserted, travelers have quit the road. The treaty is broken, its oaths are despised, its obligation is disregarded.
23»ç 33:9 The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
23»ç 33:10 "Now I will arise," says the LORD, "now I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.
23»ç 33:11 You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.
23»ç 33:12 And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire."
23»ç 33:13 Hear, you who are far away, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.
23»ç 33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: "Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting flames?"
23»ç 33:15 Those who walk righteously and speak uprightly, who despise the gain of oppression, who wave away a bribe instead of accepting it, who stop their ears from hearing of bloodshed and shut their eyes from looking on evil,
23»ç 33:16 they will live on the heights; their refuge will be the fortresses of rocks; their food will be supplied, their water assured.
23»ç 33:17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches far away.
23»ç 33:18 Your mind will muse on the terror: "Where is the one who counted? Where is the one who weighed the tribute? Where is the one who counted the towers?"
23»ç 33:19 No longer will you see the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a language that you cannot understand.
23»ç 33:20 Look on Zion, the city of our appointed festivals! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be pulled up, and none of whose ropes will be broken.
23»ç 33:21 But there the LORD in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass.
23»ç 33:22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our ruler, the LORD is our king; he will save us.
23»ç 33:23 Your rigging hangs loose; it cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out. Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will fall to plundering.
23»ç 33:24 And no inhabitant will say, "I am sick"; the people who live there will be forgiven their iniquity.
23»ç 34:1 Draw near, O nations, to hear; O peoples, give heed! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it; the world, and all that comes from it.
23»ç 34:2 For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, and furious against all their hoards; he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter.
23»ç 34:3 Their slain shall be cast out, and the stench of their corpses shall rise; the mountains shall flow with their blood.
23»ç 34:4 All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall wither like a leaf withering on a vine, or fruit withering on a fig tree.
23»ç 34:5 When my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, lo, it will descend upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to judgment.
23»ç 34:6 The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood, it is gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23»ç 34:7 Wild oxen shall fall with them, and young steers with the mighty bulls. Their land shall be soaked with blood, and their soil made rich with fat.
23»ç 34:8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of vindication by Zion's cause.
23»ç 34:9 And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch.
23»ç 34:10 Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and ever.
23»ç 34:11 But the hawk and the hedgehog shall possess it; the owl and the raven shall live in it. He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, and the plummet of chaos over its nobles.
23»ç 34:12 They shall name it No Kingdom There, and all its princes shall be nothing.
23»ç 34:13 Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches.
23»ç 34:14 Wildcats shall meet with hyenas, goat-demons shall call to each other; there too Lilith shall repose, and find a place to rest.
23»ç 34:15 There shall the owl nest and lay and hatch and brood in its shadow; there too the buzzards shall gather, each one with its mate.
23»ç 34:16 Seek and read from the book of the LORD: Not one of these shall be missing; none shall be without its mate. For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, and his spirit has gathered them.
23»ç 34:17 He has cast the lot for them, his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; they shall possess it forever, from generation to generation they shall live in it.
23»ç 35:1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; like the crocus
23»ç 35:2 it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.
23»ç 35:3 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
23»ç 35:4 Say to those who are of a fearful heart, "Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you."
23»ç 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;
23»ç 35:6 then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;
23»ç 35:7 the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
23»ç 35:8 A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way; the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God's people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.
23»ç 35:9 No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.
23»ç 35:10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
23»ç 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23»ç 36:2 The king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. He stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field.
23»ç 36:3 And there came out to him Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder.
23»ç 36:4 The Rabshakeh said to them, "Say to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you base this confidence of yours?
23»ç 36:5 Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me?
23»ç 36:6 See, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
23»ç 36:7 But if you say to me, 'We rely on the LORD our God,' is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'?
23»ç 36:8 Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
23»ç 36:9 How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
23»ç 36:10 Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
23»ç 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
23»ç 36:12 But the Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the people sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?"
23»ç 36:13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23»ç 36:14 Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
23»ç 36:15 Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the LORD by saying, The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
23»ç 36:16 Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: 'Make your peace with me and come out to me; then everyone of you will eat from your own vine and your own fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,
23»ç 36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23»ç 36:18 Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, The LORD will save us. Has any of the gods of the nations saved their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
23»ç 36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
23»ç 36:20 Who among all the gods of these countries have saved their countries out of my hand, that the LORD should save Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
23»ç 36:21 But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
23»ç 36:22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
23»ç 37:1 When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
23»ç 37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23»ç 37:3 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
23»ç 37:4 It may be that the LORD your God heard the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left."
23»ç 37:5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
23»ç 37:6 Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
23»ç 37:7 I myself will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'"
23»ç 37:8 The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
23»ç 37:9 Now the king heard concerning King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, "He has set out to fight against you." When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
23»ç 37:10 "Thus shall you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
23»ç 37:11 See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?
23»ç 37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my predecessors destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
23»ç 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?"
23»ç 37:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.
23»ç 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying:
23»ç 37:16 "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
23»ç 37:17 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
23»ç 37:18 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
23»ç 37:19 and have hurled their gods into the fire, though they were no gods, but the work of human hands--wood and stone--and so they were destroyed.
23»ç 37:20 So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD."
23»ç 37:21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria,
23»ç 37:22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: She despises you, she scorns you--virgin daughter Zion; she tosses her head--behind your back, daughter Jerusalem.
23»ç 37:23 Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23»ç 37:24 By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, 'With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon; I felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses; I came to its remotest height, its densest forest.
23»ç 37:25 I dug wells and drank waters, I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.'
23»ç 37:26 Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,
23»ç 37:27 while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded; they have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.
23»ç 37:28 I know your rising up and your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
23»ç 37:29 Because you have raged against me and your arrogance has come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth; I will turn you back on the way by which you came.
23»ç 37:30 "And this shall be the sign for you: This year eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that; then in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
23»ç 37:31 The surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;
23»ç 37:32 for from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out, and from Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
23»ç 37:33 "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, shoot an arrow there, come before it with a shield, or cast up a siege ramp against it.
23»ç 37:34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return; he shall not come into this city, says the LORD.
23»ç 37:35 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
23»ç 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD set out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; when morning dawned, they were all dead bodies.
23»ç 37:37 Then King Sennacherib of Assyria left, went home, and lived at Nineveh.
23»ç 37:38 As he was worshiping in the house of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. His son Esar-haddon succeeded him.
23»ç 38:1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover."
23»ç 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD:
23»ç 38:3 "Remember now, O LORD, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23»ç 38:4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
23»ç 38:5 "Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.
23»ç 38:6 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city.
23»ç 38:7 "This is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised:
23»ç 38:8 See, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps." So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.
23»ç 38:9 A writing of King Hezekiah of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
23»ç 38:10 I said: In the noontide of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.
23»ç 38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD in the land of the living; I shall look upon mortals no more among the inhabitants of the world.
23»ç 38:12 My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; like a weaver I have rolled up my life; he cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end;
23»ç 38:13 I cry for help until morning; like a lion he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23»ç 38:14 Like a swallow or a crane I clamor, I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security!
23»ç 38:15 But what can I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. All my sleep has fled because of the bitterness of my soul.
23»ç 38:16 O Lord, by these things people live, and in all these is the life of my spirit. Oh, restore me to health and make me live!
23»ç 38:17 Surely it was for my welfare that I had great bitterness; but you have held back my life from the pit of destruction, for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
23»ç 38:18 For Sheol cannot thank you, death cannot praise you; those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
23»ç 38:19 The living, the living, they thank you, as I do this day; fathers make known to children your faithfulness.
23»ç 38:20 The LORD will save me, and we will sing to stringed instruments all the days of our lives, at the house of the LORD.
23»ç 38:21 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a lump of figs, and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover."
23»ç 38:22 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
23»ç 39:1 At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
23»ç 39:2 Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
23»ç 39:3 Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say? From where did they come to you?" Hezekiah answered, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."
23»ç 39:4 He said, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them."
23»ç 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
23»ç 39:6 Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
23»ç 39:7 Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
23»ç 39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my days."
23»ç 40:1 Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.
23»ç 40:2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
23»ç 40:3 A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
23»ç 40:4 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.
23»ç 40:5 Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
23»ç 40:6 A voice says, "Cry out!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.
23»ç 40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.
23»ç 40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand forever.
23»ç 40:9 Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear; say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
23»ç 40:10 See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
23»ç 40:11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms, and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.
23»ç 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?
23»ç 40:13 Who has directed the spirit of the LORD, or as his counselor has instructed him?
23»ç 40:14 Whom did he consult for his enlightenment, and who taught him the path of justice? Who taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?
23»ç 40:15 Even the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as dust on the scales; see, he takes up the isles like fine dust.
23»ç 40:16 Lebanon would not provide fuel enough, nor are its animals enough for a burnt offering.
23»ç 40:17 All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
23»ç 40:18 To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?
23»ç 40:19 An idol? --A workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.
23»ç 40:20 As a gift one chooses mulberry wood --wood that will not rot--then seeks out a skilled artisan to set up an image that will not topple.
23»ç 40:21 Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
23»ç 40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in;
23»ç 40:23 who brings princes to naught, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.
23»ç 40:24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.
23»ç 40:25 To whom then will you compare me, or who is my equal? says the Holy One.
23»ç 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these? He who brings out their host and numbers them, calling them all by name; because he is great in strength, mighty in power, not one is missing.
23»ç 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God"?
23»ç 40:28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.
23»ç 40:29 He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.
23»ç 40:30 Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted;
23»ç 40:31 but those who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.
23»ç 41:1 Listen to me in silence, O coastlands; let the peoples renew their strength; let them approach, then let them speak; let us together draw near for judgment.
23»ç 41:2 Who has roused a victor from the east, summoned him to his service? He delivers up nations to him, and tramples kings under foot; he makes them like dust with his sword, like driven stubble with his bow.
23»ç 41:3 He pursues them and passes on safely, scarcely touching the path with his feet.
23»ç 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, am first, and will be with the last.
23»ç 41:5 The coastlands have seen and are afraid, the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.
23»ç 41:6 Each one helps the other, saying to one another, "Take courage!"
23»ç 41:7 The artisan encourages the goldsmith, and the one who smooths with the hammer encourages the one who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, "It is good"; and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.
23»ç 41:8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
23»ç 41:9 you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, "You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off";
23»ç 41:10 do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.
23»ç 41:11 Yes, all who are incensed against you shall be ashamed and disgraced; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.
23»ç 41:12 You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.
23»ç 41:13 For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, "Do not fear, I will help you."
23»ç 41:14 Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel! I will help you, says the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 41:15 Now, I will make of you a threshing sledge, sharp, new, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff.
23»ç 41:16 You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. Then you shall rejoice in the LORD; in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.
23»ç 41:17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the LORD will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
23»ç 41:18 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
23»ç 41:19 I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive; I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane and the pine together,
23»ç 41:20 so that all may see and know, all may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23»ç 41:21 Set forth your case, says the LORD; bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.
23»ç 41:22 Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former things, what they are, so that we may consider them, and that we may know their outcome; or declare to us the things to come.
23»ç 41:23 Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be afraid and terrified.
23»ç 41:24 You, indeed, are nothing and your work is nothing at all; whoever chooses you is an abomination.
23»ç 41:25 I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun he was summoned by name. He shall trample on rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay.
23»ç 41:26 Who declared it from the beginning, so that we might know, and beforehand, so that we might say, "He is right"? There was no one who declared it, none who proclaimed, none who heard your words.
23»ç 41:27 I first have declared it to Zion, and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good tidings.
23»ç 41:28 But when I look there is no one; among these there is no counselor who, when I ask, gives an answer.
23»ç 41:29 No, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their images are empty wind.
23»ç 42:1 Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
23»ç 42:2 He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;
23»ç 42:3 a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.
23»ç 42:4 He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.
23»ç 42:5 Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:
23»ç 42:6 I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations,
23»ç 42:7 to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.
23»ç 42:8 I am the LORD, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.
23»ç 42:9 See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth, I tell you of them.
23»ç 42:10 Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth! Let the sea roar and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.
23»ç 42:11 Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the tops of the mountains.
23»ç 42:12 Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.
23»ç 42:13 The LORD goes forth like a soldier, like a warrior he stirs up his fury; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes.
23»ç 42:14 For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor, I will gasp and pant.
23»ç 42:15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools.
23»ç 42:16 I will lead the blind by a road they do not know, by paths they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.
23»ç 42:17 They shall be turned back and utterly put to shame--those who trust in carved images, who say to cast images, "You are our gods."
23»ç 42:18 Listen, you that are deaf; and you that are blind, look up and see!
23»ç 42:19 Who is blind but my servant, or deaf like my messenger whom I send? Who is blind like my dedicated one, or blind like the servant of the LORD?
23»ç 42:20 He sees many things, but does not observe them; his ears are open, but he does not hear.
23»ç 42:21 The LORD was pleased, for the sake of his righteousness, to magnify his teaching and make it glorious.
23»ç 42:22 But this is a people robbed and plundered, all of them are trapped in holes and hidden in prisons; they have become a prey with no one to rescue, a spoil with no one to say, "Restore!"
23»ç 42:23 Who among you will give heed to this, who will attend and listen for the time to come?
23»ç 42:24 Who gave up Jacob to the spoiler, and Israel to the robbers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey?
23»ç 42:25 So he poured upon him the heat of his anger and the fury of war; it set him on fire all around, but he did not understand; it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.
23»ç 43:1 But now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.
23»ç 43:2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.
23»ç 43:3 For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.
23»ç 43:4 Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you, I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life.
23»ç 43:5 Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;
23»ç 43:6 I will say to the north, "Give them up," and to the south, "Do not withhold; bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth--
23»ç 43:7 everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
23»ç 43:8 Bring forth the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears!
23»ç 43:9 Let all the nations gather together, and let the peoples assemble. Who among them declared this, and foretold to us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to justify them, and let them hear and say, "It is true."
23»ç 43:10 You are my witnesses, says the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.
23»ç 43:11 I, I am the LORD, and besides me there is no savior.
23»ç 43:12 I declared and saved and proclaimed, when there was no strange god among you; and you are my witnesses, says the LORD.
23»ç 43:13 I am God, and also henceforth I am He; there is no one who can deliver from my hand; I work and who can hinder it?
23»ç 43:14 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I will send to Babylon and break down all the bars, and the shouting of the Chaldeans will be turned to lamentation.
23»ç 43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
23»ç 43:16 Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,
23»ç 43:17 who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior; they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:
23»ç 43:18 Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.
23»ç 43:19 I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
23»ç 43:20 The wild animals will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people,
23»ç 43:21 the people whom I formed for myself so that they might declare my praise.
23»ç 43:22 Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel!
23»ç 43:23 You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings, or honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, or wearied you with frankincense.
23»ç 43:24 You have not bought me sweet cane with money, or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins; you have wearied me with your iniquities.
23»ç 43:25 I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.
23»ç 43:26 Accuse me, let us go to trial; set forth your case, so that you may be proved right.
23»ç 43:27 Your first ancestor sinned, and your interpreters transgressed against me.
23»ç 43:28 Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, I delivered Jacob to utter destruction, and Israel to reviling.
23»ç 44:1 But now hear, O Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen!
23»ç 44:2 Thus says the LORD who made you, who formed you in the womb and will help you: Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
23»ç 44:3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my spirit upon your descendants, and my blessing on your offspring.
23»ç 44:4 They shall spring up like a green tamarisk, like willows by flowing streams.
23»ç 44:5 This one will say, "I am the LORD's," another will be called by the name of Jacob, yet another will write on the hand, "The LORD's," and adopt the name of Israel.
23»ç 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.
23»ç 44:7 Who is like me? Let them proclaim it, let them declare and set it forth before me. Who has announced from of old the things to come? Let them tell us what is yet to be.
23»ç 44:8 Do not fear, or be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? You are my witnesses! Is there any God besides me? There is no other Rock; I know not one.
23»ç 44:9 All who make idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit; their witnesses neither see nor know. And so they will be put to shame.
23»ç 44:10 Who would fashion a god or cast an image that can do no good?
23»ç 44:11 Look, all its devotees shall be put to shame; the artisans too are merely human. Let them all assemble, let them stand up; they shall be terrified, they shall all be put to shame.
23»ç 44:12 The ironsmith fashions it and works it over the coals, shaping it with hammers, and forging it with his strong arm; he becomes hungry and his strength fails, he drinks no water and is faint.
23»ç 44:13 The carpenter stretches a line, marks it out with a stylus, fashions it with planes, and marks it with a compass; he makes it in human form, with human beauty, to be set up in a shrine.
23»ç 44:14 He cuts down cedars or chooses a holm tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it.
23»ç 44:15 Then it can be used as fuel. Part of it he takes and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Then he makes a god and worships it, makes it a carved image and bows down before it.
23»ç 44:16 Half of it he burns in the fire; over this half he roasts meat, eats it and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, "Ah, I am warm, I can feel the fire!"
23»ç 44:17 The rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, bows down to it and worships it; he prays to it and says, "Save me, for you are my god!"
23»ç 44:18 They do not know, nor do they comprehend; for their eyes are shut, so that they cannot see, and their minds as well, so that they cannot understand.
23»ç 44:19 No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, "Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals, I roasted meat and have eaten. Now shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?"
23»ç 44:20 He feeds on ashes; a deluded mind has led him astray, and he cannot save himself or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a fraud?"
23»ç 44:21 Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant; I formed you, you are my servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
23»ç 44:22 I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like mist; return to me, for I have redeemed you.
23»ç 44:23 Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it; shout, O depths of the earth; break forth into singing, O mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and will be glorified in Israel.
23»ç 44:24 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who by myself spread out the earth;
23»ç 44:25 who frustrates the omens of liars, and makes fools of diviners; who turns back the wise, and makes their knowledge foolish;
23»ç 44:26 who confirms the word of his servant, and fulfills the prediction of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, "It shall be inhabited," and of the cities of Judah, "They shall be rebuilt, and I will raise up their ruins";
23»ç 44:27 who says to the deep, "Be dry--I will dry up your rivers";
23»ç 44:28 who says of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd, and he shall carry out all my purpose"; and who says of Jerusalem, "It shall be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Your foundation shall be laid."
23»ç 45:1 Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him and strip kings of their robes, to open doors before him--and the gates shall not be closed:
23»ç 45:2 I will go before you and level the mountains, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron,
23»ç 45:3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches hidden in secret places, so that you may know that it is I, the LORD, the God of Israel, who call you by your name.
23»ç 45:4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me.
23»ç 45:5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; besides me there is no God. I arm you, though you do not know me,
23»ç 45:6 so that they may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is no one besides me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23»ç 45:7 I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe; I the LORD do all these things.
23»ç 45:8 Shower, O heavens, from above, and let the skies rain down righteousness; let the earth open, that salvation may spring up, and let it cause righteousness to sprout up also; I the LORD have created it.
23»ç 45:9 Woe to you who strive with your Maker, earthen vessels with the potter! Does the clay say to the one who fashions it, "What are you making"? or "Your work has no handles"?
23»ç 45:10 Woe to anyone who says to a father, "What are you begetting?" or to a woman, "With what are you in labor?"
23»ç 45:11 Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Will you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands?
23»ç 45:12 I made the earth, and created humankind upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.
23»ç 45:13 I have aroused Cyrus in righteousness, and I will make all his paths straight; he shall build my city and set my exiles free, not for price or reward, says the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 45:14 Thus says the LORD: The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, tall of stature, shall come over to you and be yours, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, saying, "God is with you alone, and there is no other; there is no god besides him."
23»ç 45:15 Truly, you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
23»ç 45:16 All of them are put to shame and confounded, the makers of idols go in confusion together.
23»ç 45:17 But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.
23»ç 45:18 For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23»ç 45:19 I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, "Seek me in chaos." I the LORD speak the truth, I declare what is right.
23»ç 45:20 Assemble yourselves and come together, draw near, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge--those who carry about their wooden idols, and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.
23»ç 45:21 Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is no one besides me.
23»ç 45:22 Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.
23»ç 45:23 By myself I have sworn, from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return: "To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."
23»ç 45:24 Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; all who were incensed against him shall come to him and be ashamed.
23»ç 45:25 In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall triumph and glory.
23»ç 46:1 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols are on beasts and cattle; these things you carry are loaded as burdens on weary animals.
23»ç 46:2 They stoop, they bow down together; they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity.
23»ç 46:3 Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from your birth, carried from the womb;
23»ç 46:4 even to your old age I am he, even when you turn gray I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save.
23»ç 46:5 To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, as though we were alike?
23»ç 46:6 Those who lavish gold from the purse, and weigh out silver in the scales--they hire a goldsmith, who makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship!
23»ç 46:7 They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries out to it, it does not answer or save anyone from trouble.
23»ç 46:8 Remember this and consider, recall it to mind, you transgressors,
23»ç 46:9 remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me,
23»ç 46:10 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, "My purpose shall stand, and I will fulfill my intention,"
23»ç 46:11 calling a bird of prey from the east, the man for my purpose from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have planned, and I will do it.
23»ç 46:12 Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from deliverance:
23»ç 46:13 I bring near my deliverance, it is not far off, and my salvation will not tarry; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory.
23»ç 47:1 Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
23»ç 47:2 Take the millstones and grind meal, remove your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.
23»ç 47:3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one.
23»ç 47:4 Our Redeemer--the LORD of hosts is his name--is the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 47:5 Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
23»ç 47:6 I was angry with my people, I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand, you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.
23»ç 47:7 You said, "I shall be mistress forever," so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.
23»ç 47:8 Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children"--
23»ç 47:9 both these things shall come upon you in a moment, in one day: the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.
23»ç 47:10 You felt secure in your wickedness; you said, "No one sees me." Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me."
23»ç 47:11 But evil shall come upon you, which you cannot charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to ward off; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing.
23»ç 47:12 Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed, perhaps you may inspire terror.
23»ç 47:13 You are wearied with your many consultations; let those who study the heavens stand up and save you, those who gaze at the stars, and at each new moon predict what shall befall you.
23»ç 47:14 See, they are like stubble, the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!
23»ç 47:15 Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have trafficked with you from your youth; they all wander about in their own paths; there is no one to save you.
23»ç 48:1 Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came forth from the loins of Judah; who swear by the name of the LORD, and invoke the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.
23»ç 48:2 For they call themselves after the holy city, and lean on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is his name.
23»ç 48:3 The former things I declared long ago, they went out from my mouth and I made them known; then suddenly I did them and they came to pass.
23»ç 48:4 Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass,
23»ç 48:5 I declared them to you from long ago, before they came to pass I announced them to you, so that you would not say, "My idol did them, my carved image and my cast image commanded them."
23»ç 48:6 You have heard; now see all this; and will you not declare it? From this time forward I make you hear new things, hidden things that you have not known.
23»ç 48:7 They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, so that you could not say, "I already knew them."
23»ç 48:8 You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and that from birth you were called a rebel.
23»ç 48:9 For my name's sake I defer my anger, for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, so that I may not cut you off.
23»ç 48:10 See, I have refined you, but not like silver; I have tested you in the furnace of adversity.
23»ç 48:11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for why should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.
23»ç 48:12 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am He; I am the first, and I am the last.
23»ç 48:13 My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they stand at attention.
23»ç 48:14 Assemble, all of you, and hear! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
23»ç 48:15 I, even I, have spoken and called him, I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
23»ç 48:16 Draw near to me, hear this! From the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there. And now the Lord GOD has sent me and his spirit.
23»ç 48:17 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD your God, who teaches you for your own good, who leads you in the way you should go.
23»ç 48:18 O that you had paid attention to my commandments! Then your prosperity would have been like a river, and your success like the waves of the sea;
23»ç 48:19 your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me.
23»ç 48:20 Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it forth to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"
23»ç 48:21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split open the rock and the water gushed out.
23»ç 48:22 "There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
23»ç 49:1 Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away! The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother's womb he named me.
23»ç 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.
23»ç 49:3 And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
23»ç 49:4 But I said, "I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God."
23»ç 49:5 And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him, for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength--
23»ç 49:6 he says, "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel; I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."
23»ç 49:7 Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers, "Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23»ç 49:8 Thus says the LORD: In a time of favor I have answered you, on a day of salvation I have helped you; I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages;
23»ç 49:9 saying to the prisoners, "Come out," to those who are in darkness, "Show yourselves." They shall feed along the ways, on all the bare heights shall be their pasture;
23»ç 49:10 they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them down, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.
23»ç 49:11 And I will turn all my mountains into a road, and my highways shall be raised up.
23»ç 49:12 Lo, these shall come from far away, and lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene.
23»ç 49:13 Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones.
23»ç 49:14 But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me."
23»ç 49:15 Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
23»ç 49:16 See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
23»ç 49:17 Your builders outdo your destroyers, and those who laid you waste go away from you.
23»ç 49:18 Lift up your eyes all around and see; they all gather, they come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall put all of them on like an ornament, and like a bride you shall bind them on.
23»ç 49:19 Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land--surely now you will be too crowded for your inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
23»ç 49:20 The children born in the time of your bereavement will yet say in your hearing: "The place is too crowded for me; make room for me to settle."
23»ç 49:21 Then you will say in your heart, "Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren, exiled and put away--so who has reared these? I was left all alone--where then have these come from?"
23»ç 49:22 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will soon lift up my hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
23»ç 49:23 Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.
23»ç 49:24 Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
23»ç 49:25 But thus says the LORD: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued; for I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.
23»ç 49:26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23»ç 50:1 Thus says the LORD: Where is your mother's bill of divorce with which I put her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? No, because of your sins you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.
23»ç 50:2 Why was no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? By my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water, and die of thirst.
23»ç 50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering.
23»ç 50:4 The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. Morning by morning he wakens--wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.
23»ç 50:5 The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.
23»ç 50:6 I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.
23»ç 50:7 The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame;
23»ç 50:8 he who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.
23»ç 50:9 It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty? All of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.
23»ç 50:10 Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light, yet trusts in the name of the LORD and relies upon his God?
23»ç 50:11 But all of you are kindlers of fire, lighters of firebrands. Walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled! This is what you shall have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment.
23»ç 51:1 Listen to me, you that pursue righteousness, you that seek the LORD. Look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
23»ç 51:2 Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he was but one when I called him, but I blessed him and made him many.
23»ç 51:3 For the LORD will comfort Zion; he will comfort all her waste places, and will make her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.
23»ç 51:4 Listen to me, my people, and give heed to me, my nation; for a teaching will go out from me, and my justice for a light to the peoples.
23»ç 51:5 I will bring near my deliverance swiftly, my salvation has gone out and my arms will rule the peoples; the coastlands wait for me, and for my arm they hope.
23»ç 51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and those who live on it will die like gnats; but my salvation will be forever, and my deliverance will never be ended.
23»ç 51:7 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, you people who have my teaching in your hearts; do not fear the reproach of others, and do not be dismayed when they revile you.
23»ç 51:8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my deliverance will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.
23»ç 51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD! Awake, as in days of old, the generations of long ago! Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon?
23»ç 51:10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to cross over?
23»ç 51:11 So the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
23»ç 51:12 I, I am he who comforts you; why then are you afraid of a mere mortal who must die, a human being who fades like grass?
23»ç 51:13 You have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, who is bent on destruction. But where is the fury of the oppressor?
23»ç 51:14 The oppressed shall speedily be released; they shall not die and go down to the Pit, nor shall they lack bread.
23»ç 51:15 For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar--the LORD of hosts is his name.
23»ç 51:16 I have put my words in your mouth, and hidden you in the shadow of my hand, stretching out the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth, and saying to Zion, "You are my people."
23»ç 51:17 Rouse yourself, rouse yourself! Stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl of staggering.
23»ç 51:18 There is no one to guide her among all the children she has borne; there is no one to take her by the hand among all the children she has brought up.
23»ç 51:19 These two things have befallen you--who will grieve with you?--devastation and destruction, famine and sword--who will comfort you?
23»ç 51:20 Your children have fainted, they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
23»ç 51:21 Therefore hear this, you who are wounded, who are drunk, but not with wine:
23»ç 51:22 Thus says your Sovereign, the LORD, your God who pleads the cause of his people: See, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering; you shall drink no more from the bowl of my wrath.
23»ç 51:23 And I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who have said to you, "Bow down, that we may walk on you"; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to walk on.
23»ç 52:1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion! Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall enter you no more.
23»ç 52:2 Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, O captive Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter Zion!
23»ç 52:3 For thus says the LORD: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.
23»ç 52:4 For thus says the Lord GOD: Long ago, my people went down into Egypt to reside there as aliens; the Assyrian, too, has oppressed them without cause.
23»ç 52:5 Now therefore what am I doing here, says the LORD, seeing that my people are taken away without cause? Their rulers howl, says the LORD, and continually, all day long, my name is despised.
23»ç 52:6 Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here am I.
23»ç 52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns."
23»ç 52:8 Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy; for in plain sight they see the return of the LORD to Zion.
23»ç 52:9 Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem; for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23»ç 52:10 The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
23»ç 52:11 Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst of it, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
23»ç 52:12 For you shall not go out in haste, and you shall not go in flight; for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23»ç 52:13 See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.
23»ç 52:14 Just as there were many who were astonished at him --so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals--
23»ç 52:15 so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.
23»ç 53:1 Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
23»ç 53:2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
23»ç 53:3 He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.
23»ç 53:4 Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.
23»ç 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.
23»ç 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
23»ç 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
23»ç 53:8 By a perversion of justice he was taken away. Who could have imagined his future? For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people.
23»ç 53:9 They made his grave with the wicked and his tomb with the rich, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.
23»ç 53:10 Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him with pain. When you make his life an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days; through him the will of the LORD shall prosper.
23»ç 53:11 Out of his anguish he shall see light; he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.
23»ç 53:12 Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
23»ç 54:1 Sing, O barren one who did not bear; burst into song and shout, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate woman will be more than the children of her that is married, says the LORD.
23»ç 54:2 Enlarge the site of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.
23»ç 54:3 For you will spread out to the right and to the left, and your descendants will possess the nations and will settle the desolate towns.
23»ç 54:4 Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed; do not be discouraged, for you will not suffer disgrace; for you will forget the shame of your youth, and the disgrace of your widowhood you will remember no more.
23»ç 54:5 For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called.
23»ç 54:6 For the LORD has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, like the wife of a man's youth when she is cast off, says your God.
23»ç 54:7 For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you.
23»ç 54:8 In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the LORD, your Redeemer.
23»ç 54:9 This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you.
23»ç 54:10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
23»ç 54:11 O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, I am about to set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
23»ç 54:12 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of jewels, and all your wall of precious stones.
23»ç 54:13 All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the prosperity of your children.
23»ç 54:14 In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
23»ç 54:15 If anyone stirs up strife, it is not from me; whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you.
23»ç 54:16 See it is I who have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and produces a weapon fit for its purpose; I have also created the ravager to destroy.
23»ç 54:17 No weapon that is fashioned against you shall prosper, and you shall confute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their vindication from me, says the LORD.
23»ç 55:1 Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you that have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
23»ç 55:2 Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.
23»ç 55:3 Incline your ear, and come to me; listen, so that you may live. I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David.
23»ç 55:4 See, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples.
23»ç 55:5 See, you shall call nations that you do not know, and nations that do not know you shall run to you, because of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you.
23»ç 55:6 Seek the LORD while he may be found, call upon him while he is near;
23»ç 55:7 let the wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to the LORD, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
23»ç 55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.
23»ç 55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23»ç 55:10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
23»ç 55:11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
23»ç 55:12 For you shall go out in joy, and be led back in peace; the mountains and the hills before you shall burst into song, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
23»ç 55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; and it shall be to the LORD for a memorial, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
23»ç 56:1 Thus says the LORD: Maintain justice, and do what is right, for soon my salvation will come, and my deliverance be revealed.
23»ç 56:2 Happy is the mortal who does this, the one who holds it fast, who keeps the sabbath, not profaning it, and refrains from doing any evil.
23»ç 56:3 Do not let the foreigner joined to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely separate me from his people"; and do not let the eunuch say, "I am just a dry tree."
23»ç 56:4 For thus says the LORD: To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant,
23»ç 56:5 I will give, in my house and within my walls, a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
23»ç 56:6 And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, all who keep the sabbath, and do not profane it, and hold fast my covenant--
23»ç 56:7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
23»ç 56:8 Thus says the Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, I will gather others to them besides those already gathered.
23»ç 56:9 All you wild animals, all you wild animals in the forest, come to devour!
23»ç 56:10 Israel's sentinels are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all silent dogs that cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
23»ç 56:11 The dogs have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. The shepherds also have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, to their own gain, one and all.
23»ç 56:12 "Come," they say, "let us get wine; let us fill ourselves with strong drink. And tomorrow will be like today, great beyond measure."
23»ç 57:1 The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous are taken away from calamity,
23»ç 57:2 and they enter into peace; those who walk uprightly will rest on their couches.
23»ç 57:3 But as for you, come here, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of an adulterer and a whore.
23»ç 57:4 Whom are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit--
23»ç 57:5 you that burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree; you that slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
23»ç 57:6 Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they, are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a grain offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?
23»ç 57:7 Upon a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifice.
23»ç 57:8 Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your symbol; for, in deserting me, you have uncovered your bed, you have gone up to it, you have made it wide; and you have made a bargain for yourself with them, you have loved their bed, you have gazed on their nakedness.
23»ç 57:9 You journeyed to Molech with oil, and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far away, and sent down even to Sheol.
23»ç 57:10 You grew weary from your many wanderings, but you did not say, "It is useless." You found your desire rekindled, and so you did not weaken.
23»ç 57:11 Whom did you dread and fear so that you lied, and did not remember me or give me a thought? Have I not kept silent and closed my eyes, and so you do not fear me?
23»ç 57:12 I will concede your righteousness and your works, but they will not help you.
23»ç 57:13 When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But whoever takes refuge in me shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain.
23»ç 57:14 It shall be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people's way."
23»ç 57:15 For thus says the high and lofty one who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with those who are contrite and humble in spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23»ç 57:16 For I will not continually accuse, nor will I always be angry; for then the spirits would grow faint before me, even the souls that I have made.
23»ç 57:17 Because of their wicked covetousness I was angry; I struck them, I hid and was angry; but they kept turning back to their own ways.
23»ç 57:18 I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will lead them and repay them with comfort, creating for their mourners the fruit of the lips.
23»ç 57:19 Peace, peace, to the far and the near, says the LORD; and I will heal them.
23»ç 57:20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea that cannot keep still; its waters toss up mire and mud.
23»ç 57:21 There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.
23»ç 58:1 Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet! Announce to my people their rebellion, to the house of Jacob their sins.
23»ç 58:2 Yet day after day they seek me and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.
23»ç 58:3 "Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?" Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers.
23»ç 58:4 Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.
23»ç 58:5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?
23»ç 58:6 Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
23»ç 58:7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?
23»ç 58:8 Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
23»ç 58:9 Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am. If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,
23»ç 58:10 if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.
23»ç 58:11 The LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail.
23»ç 58:12 Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in.
23»ç 58:13 If you refrain from trampling the sabbath, from pursuing your own interests on my holy day; if you call the sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs;
23»ç 58:14 then you shall take delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 59:1 See, the LORD's hand is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.
23»ç 59:2 Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
23»ç 59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.
23»ç 59:4 No one brings suit justly, no one goes to law honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, conceiving mischief and begetting iniquity.
23»ç 59:5 They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web; whoever eats their eggs dies, and the crushed egg hatches out a viper.
23»ç 59:6 Their webs cannot serve as clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands.
23»ç 59:7 Their feet run to evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are in their highways.
23»ç 59:8 The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths. Their roads they have made crooked; no one who walks in them knows peace.
23»ç 59:9 Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us; we wait for light, and lo! there is darkness; and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
23»ç 59:10 We grope like the blind along a wall, groping like those who have no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among the vigorous as though we were dead.
23»ç 59:11 We all growl like bears; like doves we moan mournfully. We wait for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.
23»ç 59:12 For our transgressions before you are many, and our sins testify against us. Our transgressions indeed are with us, and we know our iniquities:
23»ç 59:13 transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning away from following our God, talking oppression and revolt, conceiving lying words and uttering them from the heart.
23»ç 59:14 Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands at a distance; for truth stumbles in the public square, and uprightness cannot enter.
23»ç 59:15 Truth is lacking, and whoever turns from evil is despoiled. The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
23»ç 59:16 He saw that there was no one, and was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm brought him victory, and his righteousness upheld him.
23»ç 59:17 He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in fury as in a mantle.
23»ç 59:18 According to their deeds, so will he repay; wrath to his adversaries, requital to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render requital.
23»ç 59:19 So those in the west shall fear the name of the LORD, and those in the east, his glory; for he will come like a pent-up stream that the wind of the LORD drives on.
23»ç 59:20 And he will come to Zion as Redeemer, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, says the LORD.
23»ç 59:21 And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says the LORD: my spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouths of your children, or out of the mouths of your children's children, says the LORD, from now on and forever.
23»ç 60:1 Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
23»ç 60:2 For darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will appear over you.
23»ç 60:3 Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
23»ç 60:4 Lift up your eyes and look around; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from far away, and your daughters shall be carried on their nurses' arms.
23»ç 60:5 Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and rejoice, because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
23»ç 60:6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praise of the LORD.
23»ç 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall be acceptable on my altar, and I will glorify my glorious house.
23»ç 60:8 Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their windows?
23»ç 60:9 For the coastlands shall wait for me, the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your children from far away, their silver and gold with them, for the name of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.
23»ç 60:10 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you; for in my wrath I struck you down, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
23»ç 60:11 Your gates shall always be open; day and night they shall not be shut, so that nations shall bring you their wealth, with their kings led in procession.
23»ç 60:12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
23»ç 60:13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will glorify where my feet rest.
23»ç 60:14 The descendants of those who oppressed you shall come bending low to you, and all who despised you shall bow down at your feet; they shall call you the City of the LORD, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 60:15 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age.
23»ç 60:16 You shall suck the milk of nations, you shall suck the breasts of kings; and you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23»ç 60:17 Instead of bronze I will bring gold, instead of iron I will bring silver; instead of wood, bronze, instead of stones, iron. I will appoint Peace as your overseer and Righteousness as your taskmaster.
23»ç 60:18 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation or destruction within your borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
23»ç 60:19 The sun shall no longer be your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to you by night; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23»ç 60:20 Your sun shall no more go down, or your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.
23»ç 60:21 Your people shall all be righteous; they shall possess the land forever. They are the shoot that I planted, the work of my hands, so that I might be glorified.
23»ç 60:22 The least of them shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will accomplish it quickly.
23»ç 61:1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;
23»ç 61:2 to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
23»ç 61:3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion--to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.
23»ç 61:4 They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
23»ç 61:5 Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, foreigners shall till your land and dress your vines;
23»ç 61:6 but you shall be called priests of the LORD, you shall be named ministers of our God; you shall enjoy the wealth of the nations, and in their riches you shall glory.
23»ç 61:7 Because their shame was double, and dishonor was proclaimed as their lot, therefore they shall possess a double portion; everlasting joy shall be theirs.
23»ç 61:8 For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
23»ç 61:9 Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed.
23»ç 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23»ç 61:11 For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
23»ç 62:1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.
23»ç 62:2 The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory; and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.
23»ç 62:3 You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
23»ç 62:4 You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate; but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.
23»ç 62:5 For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.
23»ç 62:6 Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted sentinels; all day and all night they shall never be silent. You who remind the LORD, take no rest,
23»ç 62:7 and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it renowned throughout the earth.
23»ç 62:8 The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners shall not drink the wine for which you have labored;
23»ç 62:9 but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather it shall drink it in my holy courts.
23»ç 62:10 Go through, go through the gates, prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway, clear it of stones, lift up an ensign over the peoples.
23»ç 62:11 The LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to daughter Zion, "See, your salvation comes; his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."
23»ç 62:12 They shall be called, "The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD"; and you shall be called, "Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken."
23»ç 63:1 "Who is this that comes from Edom, from Bozrah in garments stained crimson? Who is this so splendidly robed, marching in his great might?" "It is I, announcing vindication, mighty to save."
23»ç 63:2 "Why are your robes red, and your garments like theirs who tread the winepress?"
23»ç 63:3 "I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their juice spattered on my garments, and stained all my robes.
23»ç 63:4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year for my redeeming work had come.
23»ç 63:5 I looked, but there was no helper; I stared, but there was no one to sustain me; so my own arm brought me victory, and my wrath sustained me.
23»ç 63:6 I trampled down peoples in my anger, I crushed them in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
23»ç 63:7 I will recount the gracious deeds of the LORD, the praiseworthy acts of the LORD, because of all that the LORD has done for us, and the great favor to the house of Israel that he has shown them according to his mercy, according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
23»ç 63:8 For he said, "Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely"; and he became their savior
23»ç 63:9 in all their distress. It was no messenger or angel but his presence that saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23»ç 63:10 But they rebelled and grieved his holy spirit; therefore he became their enemy; he himself fought against them.
23»ç 63:11 Then they remembered the days of old, of Moses his servant. Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is the one who put within them his holy spirit,
23»ç 63:12 who caused his glorious arm to march at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name,
23»ç 63:13 who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble.
23»ç 63:14 Like cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of the LORD gave them rest. Thus you led your people, to make for yourself a glorious name.
23»ç 63:15 Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and glorious habitation. Where are your zeal and your might? The yearning of your heart and your compassion? They are withheld from me.
23»ç 63:16 For you are our father, though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our father; our Redeemer from of old is your name.
23»ç 63:17 Why, O LORD, do you make us stray from your ways and harden our heart, so that we do not fear you? Turn back for the sake of your servants, for the sake of the tribes that are your heritage.
23»ç 63:18 Your holy people took possession for a little while; but now our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.
23»ç 63:19 We have long been like those whom you do not rule, like those not called by your name.
23»ç 64:1 O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence--
23»ç 64:2 as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil--to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!
23»ç 64:3 When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
23»ç 64:4 From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.
23»ç 64:5 You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways. But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.
23»ç 64:6 We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
23»ç 64:7 There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.
23»ç 64:8 Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23»ç 64:9 Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember iniquity forever. Now consider, we are all your people.
23»ç 64:10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
23»ç 64:11 Our holy and beautiful house, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
23»ç 64:12 After all this, will you restrain yourself, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and punish us so severely?
23»ç 65:1 I was ready to be sought out by those who did not ask, to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, "Here I am, here I am," to a nation that did not call on my name.
23»ç 65:2 I held out my hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;
23»ç 65:3 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and offering incense on bricks;
23»ç 65:4 who sit inside tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat swine's flesh, with broth of abominable things in their vessels;
23»ç 65:5 who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you." These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.
23»ç 65:6 See, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their laps
23»ç 65:7 their iniquities and their ancestors' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they offered incense on the mountains and reviled me on the hills, I will measure into their laps full payment for their actions.
23»ç 65:8 Thus says the LORD: As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, "Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it," so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all.
23»ç 65:9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there.
23»ç 65:10 Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.
23»ç 65:11 But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;
23»ç 65:12 I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my sight, and chose what I did not delight in.
23»ç 65:13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;
23»ç 65:14 my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.
23»ç 65:15 You shall leave your name to my chosen to use as a curse, and the Lord GOD will put you to death; but to his servants he will give a different name.
23»ç 65:16 Then whoever invokes a blessing in the land shall bless by the God of faithfulness, and whoever takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of faithfulness; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my sight.
23»ç 65:17 For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.
23»ç 65:18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating; for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.
23»ç 65:19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.
23»ç 65:20 No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime; for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.
23»ç 65:21 They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23»ç 65:22 They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
23»ç 65:23 They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; for they shall be offspring blessed by the LORD--and their descendants as well.
23»ç 65:24 Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.
23»ç 65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent--its food shall be dust! They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the LORD.
23»ç 66:1 Thus says the LORD: Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is my resting place?
23»ç 66:2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things are mine, says the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look, to the humble and contrite in spirit, who trembles at my word.
23»ç 66:3 Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who kills a human being; whoever sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; whoever presents a grain offering, like one who offers swine's blood; whoever makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and in their abominations they take delight;
23»ç 66:4 I also will choose to mock them, and bring upon them what they fear; because, when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my sight, and chose what did not please me.
23»ç 66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: Your own people who hate you and reject you for my name's sake have said, "Let the LORD be glorified, so that we may see your joy"; but it is they who shall be put to shame.
23»ç 66:6 Listen, an uproar from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of the LORD, dealing retribution to his enemies!
23»ç 66:7 Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son.
23»ç 66:8 Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be delivered in one moment? Yet as soon as Zion was in labor she delivered her children.
23»ç 66:9 Shall I open the womb and not deliver? says the LORD; shall I, the one who delivers, shut the womb? says your God.
23»ç 66:10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her--
23»ç 66:11 that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious bosom.
23»ç 66:12 For thus says the LORD: I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm, and dandled on her knees.
23»ç 66:13 As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
23»ç 66:14 You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bodies shall flourish like the grass; and it shall be known that the hand of the LORD is with his servants, and his indignation is against his enemies.
23»ç 66:15 For the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to pay back his anger in fury, and his rebuke in flames of fire.
23»ç 66:16 For by fire will the LORD execute judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.
23»ç 66:17 Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the center, eating the flesh of pigs, vermin, and rodents, shall come to an end together, says the LORD.
23»ç 66:18 For I know their works and their thoughts, and I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and shall see my glory,
23»ç 66:19 and I will set a sign among them. From them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud--which draw the bow--to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
23»ç 66:20 They shall bring all your kindred from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring a grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
23»ç 66:21 And I will also take some of them as priests and as Levites, says the LORD.
23»ç 66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the LORD; so shall your descendants and your name remain.
23»ç 66:23 From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the LORD.
23»ç 66:24 And they shall go out and look at the dead bodies of the people who have rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
