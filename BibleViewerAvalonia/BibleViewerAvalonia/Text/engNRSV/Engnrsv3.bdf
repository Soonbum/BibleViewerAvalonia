11¿Õ»ó 1:1 King David was old and advanced in years; and although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm.
11¿Õ»ó 1:2 So his servants said to him, "Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king, and be his attendant; let her lie in your bosom, so that my lord the king may be warm."
11¿Õ»ó 1:3 So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:4 The girl was very beautiful. She became the king's attendant and served him, but the king did not know her sexually.
11¿Õ»ó 1:5 Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king"; he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
11¿Õ»ó 1:6 His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, "Why have you done thus and so?" He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom.
11¿Õ»ó 1:7 He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, and they supported Adonijah.
11¿Õ»ó 1:8 But the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the prophet Nathan, and Shimei, and Rei, and David's own warriors did not side with Adonijah.
11¿Õ»ó 1:9 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the stone Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,
11¿Õ»ó 1:10 but he did not invite the prophet Nathan or Benaiah or the warriors or his brother Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:11 Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know it?
11¿Õ»ó 1:12 Now therefore come, let me give you advice, so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:13 Go in at once to King David, and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then is Adonijah king?'
11¿Õ»ó 1:14 Then while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words."
11¿Õ»ó 1:15 So Bathsheba went to the king in his room. The king was very old; Abishag the Shunammite was attending the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:16 Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, "What do you wish?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:17 She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your servant by the LORD your God, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne.
11¿Õ»ó 1:18 But now suddenly Adonijah has become king, though you, my lord the king, do not know it.
11¿Õ»ó 1:19 He has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the children of the king, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander of the army; but your servant Solomon he has not invited.
11¿Õ»ó 1:20 But you, my lord the king--the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
11¿Õ»ó 1:21 Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors, that my son Solomon and I will be counted offenders."
11¿Õ»ó 1:22 While she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan came in.
11¿Õ»ó 1:23 The king was told, "Here is the prophet Nathan." When he came in before the king, he did obeisance to the king, with his face to the ground.
11¿Õ»ó 1:24 Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne'?
11¿Õ»ó 1:25 For today he has gone down and has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's children, Joab the commander of the army, and the priest Abiathar, who are now eating and drinking before him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
11¿Õ»ó 1:26 But he did not invite me, your servant, and the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:27 Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not let your servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:28 King David answered, "Summon Bathsheba to me." So she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:29 The king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has saved my life from every adversity,
11¿Õ»ó 1:30 as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' so will I do this day."
11¿Õ»ó 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
11¿Õ»ó 1:32 King David said, "Summon to me the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,
11¿Õ»ó 1:33 the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:34 There let the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'
11¿Õ»ó 1:35 You shall go up following him. Let him enter and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."
11¿Õ»ó 1:36 Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so ordain.
11¿Õ»ó 1:37 As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."
11¿Õ»ó 1:38 So the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule, and led him to Gihon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:39 There the priest Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"
11¿Õ»ó 1:40 And all the people went up following him, playing on pipes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth quaked at their noise.
11¿Õ»ó 1:41 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "Why is the city in an uproar?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:42 While he was still speaking, Jonathan son of the priest Abiathar arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and surely you bring good news."
11¿Õ»ó 1:43 Jonathan answered Adonijah, "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king;
11¿Õ»ó 1:44 the king has sent with him the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they had him ride on the king's mule;
11¿Õ»ó 1:45 the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you heard.
11¿Õ»ó 1:46 Solomon now sits on the royal throne.
11¿Õ»ó 1:47 Moreover the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' The king bowed in worship on the bed
11¿Õ»ó 1:48 and went on to pray thus, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who today has granted one of my offspring to sit on my throne and permitted me to witness it.'"
11¿Õ»ó 1:49 Then all the guests of Adonijah got up trembling and went their own ways.
11¿Õ»ó 1:50 Adonijah, fearing Solomon, got up and went to grasp the horns of the altar.
11¿Õ»ó 1:51 Solomon was informed, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; see, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'"
11¿Õ»ó 1:52 So Solomon responded, "If he proves to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die."
11¿Õ»ó 1:53 Then King Solomon sent to have him brought down from the altar. He came to do obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, "Go home."
11¿Õ»ó 2:1 When David's time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying:
11¿Õ»ó 2:2 "I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, be courageous,
11¿Õ»ó 2:3 and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn.
11¿Õ»ó 2:4 Then the LORD will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: 'If your heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:5 "Moreover you know also what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner son of Ner, and Amasa son of Jether, whom he murdered, retaliating in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist, and on the sandals on his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 2:6 Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
11¿Õ»ó 2:7 Deal loyally, however, with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
11¿Õ»ó 2:8 There is also with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a terrible curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:9 Therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; you will know what you ought to do to him, and you must bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol."
11¿Õ»ó 2:10 Then David slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the city of David.
11¿Õ»ó 2:11 The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 2:12 So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.
11¿Õ»ó 2:13 Then Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come peaceably?" He said, "Peaceably."
11¿Õ»ó 2:14 Then he said, "May I have a word with you?" She said, "Go on."
11¿Õ»ó 2:15 He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel expected me to reign; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 2:16 And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me." She said to him, "Go on."
11¿Õ»ó 2:17 He said, "Please ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."
11¿Õ»ó 2:18 Bathsheba said, "Very well; I will speak to the king on your behalf."
11¿Õ»ó 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.
11¿Õ»ó 2:20 Then she said, "I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Make your request, my mother; for I will not refuse you."
11¿Õ»ó 2:21 She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife."
11¿Õ»ó 2:22 King Solomon answered his mother, "And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom as well! For he is my elder brother; ask not only for him but also for the priest Abiathar and for Joab son of Zeruiah!"
11¿Õ»ó 2:23 Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, "So may God do to me, and more also, for Adonijah has devised this scheme at the risk of his life!
11¿Õ»ó 2:24 Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of my father David, and who has made me a house as he promised, today Adonijah shall be put to death."
11¿Õ»ó 2:25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he struck him down, and he died.
11¿Õ»ó 2:26 The king said to the priest Abiathar, "Go to Anathoth, to your estate; for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you shared in all the hardships my father endured."
11¿Õ»ó 2:27 So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
11¿Õ»ó 2:28 When the news came to Joab--for Joab had supported Adonijah though he had not supported Absalom--Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and grasped the horns of the altar.
11¿Õ»ó 2:29 When it was told King Solomon, "Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD and now is beside the altar," Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, strike him down."
11¿Õ»ó 2:30 So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, "The king commands, 'Come out.'" But he said, "No, I will die here." Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
11¿Õ»ó 2:31 The king replied to him, "Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him; and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause.
11¿Õ»ó 2:32 The LORD will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 2:33 So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but to David, and to his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forevermore."
11¿Õ»ó 2:34 Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him; and he was buried at his own house near the wilderness.
11¿Õ»ó 2:35 The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king put the priest Zadok in the place of Abiathar.
11¿Õ»ó 2:36 Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.
11¿Õ»ó 2:37 For on the day you go out, and cross the Wadi Kidron, know for certain that you shall die; your blood shall be on your own head."
11¿Õ»ó 2:38 And Shimei said to the king, "The sentence is fair; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
11¿Õ»ó 2:39 But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei's slaves ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. When it was told Shimei, "Your slaves are in Gath,"
11¿Õ»ó 2:40 Shimei arose and saddled a donkey, and went to Achish in Gath, to search for his slaves; Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.
11¿Õ»ó 2:41 When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,
11¿Õ»ó 2:42 the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD, and solemnly adjure you, saying, 'Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die'? And you said to me, 'The sentence is fair; I accept.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:43 Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the commandment with which I charged you?"
11¿Õ»ó 2:44 The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your own heart all the evil that you did to my father David; so the LORD will bring back your evil on your own head.
11¿Õ»ó 2:45 But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever."
11¿Õ»ó 2:46 Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 3:1 Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt; he took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 3:2 The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 3:3 Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David; only, he sacrificed and offered incense at the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 3:4 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the principal high place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
11¿Õ»ó 3:5 At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, "Ask what I should give you."
11¿Õ»ó 3:6 And Solomon said, "You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you; and you have kept for him this great and steadfast love, and have given him a son to sit on his throne today.
11¿Õ»ó 3:7 And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David, although I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
11¿Õ»ó 3:8 And your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great people, so numerous they cannot be numbered or counted.
11¿Õ»ó 3:9 Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, able to discern between good and evil; for who can govern this your great people?"
11¿Õ»ó 3:10 It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.
11¿Õ»ó 3:11 God said to him, "Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,
11¿Õ»ó 3:12 I now do according to your word. Indeed I give you a wise and discerning mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you shall arise after you.
11¿Õ»ó 3:13 I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor all your life; no other king shall compare with you.
11¿Õ»ó 3:14 If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your life."
11¿Õ»ó 3:15 Then Solomon awoke; it had been a dream. He came to Jerusalem where he stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. He offered up burnt offerings and offerings of well-being, and provided a feast for all his servants.
11¿Õ»ó 3:16 Later, two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
11¿Õ»ó 3:17 The one woman said, "Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house.
11¿Õ»ó 3:18 Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together; there was no one else with us in the house, only the two of us were in the house.
11¿Õ»ó 3:19 Then this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on him.
11¿Õ»ó 3:20 She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your servant slept. She laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast.
11¿Õ»ó 3:21 When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, I saw that he was dead; but when I looked at him closely in the morning, clearly it was not the son I had borne."
11¿Õ»ó 3:22 But the other woman said, "No, the living son is mine, and the dead son is yours." The first said, "No, the dead son is yours, and the living son is mine." So they argued before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 3:23 Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead'; while the other says, 'Not so! Your son is dead, and my son is the living one.'"
11¿Õ»ó 3:24 So the king said, "Bring me a sword," and they brought a sword before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 3:25 The king said, "Divide the living boy in two; then give half to the one, and half to the other."
11¿Õ»ó 3:26 But the woman whose son was alive said to the king--because compassion for her son burned within her--"Please, my lord, give her the living boy; certainly do not kill him!" The other said, "It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it."
11¿Õ»ó 3:27 Then the king responded: "Give the first woman the living boy; do not kill him. She is his mother."
11¿Õ»ó 3:28 All Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered; and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him, to execute justice.
11¿Õ»ó 4:1 King Solomon was king over all Israel,
11¿Õ»ó 4:2 and these were his high officials: Azariah son of Zadok was the priest;
11¿Õ»ó 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
11¿Õ»ó 4:4 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
11¿Õ»ó 4:5 Azariah son of Nathan was over the officials; Zabud son of Nathan was priest and king's friend;
11¿Õ»ó 4:6 Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor.
11¿Õ»ó 4:7 Solomon had twelve officials over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one had to make provision for one month in the year.
11¿Õ»ó 4:8 These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
11¿Õ»ó 4:9 Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
11¿Õ»ó 4:10 Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher);
11¿Õ»ó 4:11 Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (he had Taphath, Solomon's daughter, as his wife);
11¿Õ»ó 4:12 Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam;
11¿Õ»ó 4:13 Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
11¿Õ»ó 4:14 Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
11¿Õ»ó 4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he had taken Basemath, Solomon's daughter, as his wife);
11¿Õ»ó 4:16 Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
11¿Õ»ó 4:17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar;
11¿Õ»ó 4:18 Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin;
11¿Õ»ó 4:19 Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of King Sihon of the Amorites and of King Og of Bashan. And there was one official in the land of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 4:20 Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea; they ate and drank and were happy.
11¿Õ»ó 4:21 Solomon was sovereign over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, even to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
11¿Õ»ó 4:22 Solomon's provision for one day was thirty cors of choice flour, and sixty cors of meal,
11¿Õ»ó 4:23 ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, one hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl.
11¿Õ»ó 4:24 For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates; and he had peace on all sides.
11¿Õ»ó 4:25 During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel lived in safety, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all of them under their vines and fig trees.
11¿Õ»ó 4:26 Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
11¿Õ»ó 4:27 Those officials supplied provisions for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon's table, each one in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
11¿Õ»ó 4:28 They also brought to the required place barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds, each according to his charge.
11¿Õ»ó 4:29 God gave Solomon very great wisdom, discernment, and breadth of understanding as vast as the sand on the seashore,
11¿Õ»ó 4:30 so that Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
11¿Õ»ó 4:31 He was wiser than anyone else, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, children of Mahol; his fame spread throughout all the surrounding nations.
11¿Õ»ó 4:32 He composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
11¿Õ»ó 4:33 He would speak of trees, from the cedar that is in the Lebanon to the hyssop that grows in the wall; he would speak of animals, and birds, and reptiles, and fish.
11¿Õ»ó 4:34 People came from all the nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon; they came from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 5:1 Now King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father; for Hiram had always been a friend to David.
11¿Õ»ó 5:2 Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 5:3 "You know that my father David could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 5:4 But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.
11¿Õ»ó 5:5 So I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to my father David, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.'
11¿Õ»ó 5:6 Therefore command that cedars from the Lebanon be cut for me. My servants will join your servants, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians."
11¿Õ»ó 5:7 When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, "Blessed be the LORD today, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people."
11¿Õ»ó 5:8 Hiram sent word to Solomon, "I have heard the message that you have sent to me; I will fulfill all your needs in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.
11¿Õ»ó 5:9 My servants shall bring it down to the sea from the Lebanon; I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will have them broken up there for you to take away. And you shall meet my needs by providing food for my household."
11¿Õ»ó 5:10 So Hiram supplied Solomon's every need for timber of cedar and cypress.
11¿Õ»ó 5:11 Solomon in turn gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty cors of fine oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
11¿Õ»ó 5:12 So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and the two of them made a treaty.
11¿Õ»ó 5:13 King Solomon conscripted forced labor out of all Israel; the levy numbered thirty thousand men.
11¿Õ»ó 5:14 He sent them to the Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts; they would be a month in the Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
11¿Õ»ó 5:15 Solomon also had seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country,
11¿Õ»ó 5:16 besides Solomon's three thousand three hundred supervisors who were over the work, having charge of the people who did the work.
11¿Õ»ó 5:17 At the king's command, they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.
11¿Õ»ó 5:18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Giblites did the stonecutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:1 In the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 6:2 The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
11¿Õ»ó 6:3 The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits wide, across the width of the house. Its depth was ten cubits in front of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:4 For the house he made windows with recessed frames.
11¿Õ»ó 6:5 He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around.
11¿Õ»ó 6:6 The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:7 The house was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built.
11¿Õ»ó 6:8 The entrance for the middle story was on the south side of the house: one went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.
11¿Õ»ó 6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; he roofed the house with beams and planks of cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:10 He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:11 Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
11¿Õ»ó 6:12 "Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, obey my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, then I will establish my promise with you, which I made to your father David.
11¿Õ»ó 6:13 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."
11¿Õ»ó 6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
11¿Õ»ó 6:15 He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
11¿Õ»ó 6:16 He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the most holy place.
11¿Õ»ó 6:17 The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.
11¿Õ»ó 6:18 The cedar within the house had carvings of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen.
11¿Õ»ó 6:19 The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 6:20 The interior of the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:21 Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, then he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:22 Next he overlaid the whole house with gold, in order that the whole house might be perfect; even the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:23 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.
11¿Õ»ó 6:24 Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.
11¿Õ»ó 6:25 The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.
11¿Õ»ó 6:26 The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.
11¿Õ»ó 6:27 He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one was touching the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; their other wings toward the center of the house were touching wing to wing.
11¿Õ»ó 6:28 He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:29 He carved the walls of the house all around about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.
11¿Õ»ó 6:30 The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.
11¿Õ»ó 6:31 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided.
11¿Õ»ó 6:32 He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
11¿Õ»ó 6:33 So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, four-sided each,
11¿Õ»ó 6:34 and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
11¿Õ»ó 6:35 He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaying them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work.
11¿Õ»ó 6:36 He built the inner court with three courses of dressed stone to one course of cedar beams.
11¿Õ»ó 6:37 In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.
11¿Õ»ó 6:38 In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.
11¿Õ»ó 7:1 Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.
11¿Õ»ó 7:2 He built the House of the Forest of the Lebanon one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.
11¿Õ»ó 7:3 It was roofed with cedar on the forty-five rafters, fifteen in each row, which were on the pillars.
11¿Õ»ó 7:4 There were window frames in the three rows, facing each other in the three rows.
11¿Õ»ó 7:5 All the doorways and doorposts had four-sided frames, opposite, facing each other in the three rows.
11¿Õ»ó 7:6 He made the Hall of Pillars fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them.
11¿Õ»ó 7:7 He made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, the Hall of Justice, covered with cedar from floor to floor.
11¿Õ»ó 7:8 His own house where he would reside, in the other court back of the hall, was of the same construction. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken in marriage.
11¿Õ»ó 7:9 All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, from the foundation to the coping, and from outside to the great court.
11¿Õ»ó 7:10 The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:11 There were costly stones above, cut to measure, and cedarwood.
11¿Õ»ó 7:12 The great court had three courses of dressed stone to one layer of cedar beams all around; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the vestibule of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 7:13 Now King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre.
11¿Õ»ó 7:14 He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, whose father, a man of Tyre, had been an artisan in bronze; he was full of skill, intelligence, and knowledge in working bronze. He came to King Solomon, and did all his work.
11¿Õ»ó 7:15 He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of the one, and a cord of twelve cubits would encircle it; the second pillar was the same.
11¿Õ»ó 7:16 He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:17 There were nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
11¿Õ»ó 7:18 He made the columns with two rows around each latticework to cover the capitals that were above the pomegranates; he did the same with the other capital.
11¿Õ»ó 7:19 Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits high.
11¿Õ»ó 7:20 The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection that was beside the latticework; there were two hundred pomegranates in rows all around; and so with the other capital.
11¿Õ»ó 7:21 He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the south and called it Jachin; and he set up the pillar on the north and called it Boaz.
11¿Õ»ó 7:22 On the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.
11¿Õ»ó 7:23 Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely.
11¿Õ»ó 7:24 Under its brim were panels all around it, each of ten cubits, surrounding the sea; there were two rows of panels, cast when it was cast.
11¿Õ»ó 7:25 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set on them. The hindquarters of each were toward the inside.
11¿Õ»ó 7:26 Its thickness was a handbreadth; its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.
11¿Õ»ó 7:27 He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
11¿Õ»ó 7:28 This was the construction of the stands: they had borders; the borders were within the frames;
11¿Õ»ó 7:29 on the borders that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.
11¿Õ»ó 7:30 Each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.
11¿Õ»ó 7:31 Its opening was within the crown whose height was one cubit; its opening was round, as a pedestal is made; it was a cubit and a half wide. At its opening there were carvings; its borders were four-sided, not round.
11¿Õ»ó 7:32 The four wheels were underneath the borders; the axles of the wheels were in the stands; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
11¿Õ»ó 7:33 The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.
11¿Õ»ó 7:34 There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were of one piece with the stands.
11¿Õ»ó 7:35 On the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; on the top of the stand, its stays and its borders were of one piece with it.
11¿Õ»ó 7:36 On the surfaces of its stays and on its borders he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, where each had space, with wreaths all around.
11¿Õ»ó 7:37 In this way he made the ten stands; all of them were cast alike, with the same size and the same form.
11¿Õ»ó 7:38 He made ten basins of bronze; each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits; there was a basin for each of the ten stands.
11¿Õ»ó 7:39 He set five of the stands on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house; he set the sea on the southeast corner of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 7:40 Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:
11¿Õ»ó 7:41 the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;
11¿Õ»ó 7:42 the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
11¿Õ»ó 7:43 the ten stands, the ten basins on the stands;
11¿Õ»ó 7:44 the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.
11¿Õ»ó 7:45 The pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels that Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of burnished bronze.
11¿Õ»ó 7:46 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
11¿Õ»ó 7:47 Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
11¿Õ»ó 7:48 So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,
11¿Õ»ó 7:49 the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, in front of the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
11¿Õ»ó 7:50 the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; the sockets for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple, of gold.
11¿Õ»ó 7:51 Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
11¿Õ»ó 8:2 All the people of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the festival in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
11¿Õ»ó 8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark.
11¿Õ»ó 8:4 So they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.
11¿Õ»ó 8:5 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
11¿Õ»ó 8:6 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.
11¿Õ»ó 8:7 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.
11¿Õ»ó 8:8 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; they are there to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 8:9 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
11¿Õ»ó 8:10 And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD,
11¿Õ»ó 8:11 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:12 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
11¿Õ»ó 8:13 I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever."
11¿Õ»ó 8:14 Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
11¿Õ»ó 8:15 He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 8:16 'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:17 My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 8:18 But the LORD said to my father David, 'You did well to consider building a house for my name;
11¿Õ»ó 8:19 nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:20 Now the LORD has upheld the promise that he made; for I have risen in the place of my father David; I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 8:21 There I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
11¿Õ»ó 8:22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven.
11¿Õ»ó 8:23 He said, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who walk before you with all their heart,
11¿Õ»ó 8:24 the covenant that you kept for your servant my father David as you declared to him; you promised with your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand.
11¿Õ»ó 8:25 Therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David that which you promised him, saying, 'There shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:26 Therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant my father David.
11¿Õ»ó 8:27 "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built!
11¿Õ»ó 8:28 Regard your servant's prayer and his plea, O LORD my God, heeding the cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today;
11¿Õ»ó 8:29 that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you said, 'My name shall be there,' that you may heed the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.
11¿Õ»ó 8:30 Hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place; O hear in heaven your dwelling place; heed and forgive.
11¿Õ»ó 8:31 "If someone sins against a neighbor and is given an oath to swear, and comes and swears before your altar in this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:32 then hear in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing their conduct on their own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding them according to their righteousness.
11¿Õ»ó 8:33 "When your people Israel, having sinned against you, are defeated before an enemy but turn again to you, confess your name, pray and plead with you in this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:34 then hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land that you gave to their ancestors.
11¿Õ»ó 8:35 "When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and then they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin, because you punish them,
11¿Õ»ó 8:36 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and grant rain on your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.
11¿Õ»ó 8:37 "If there is famine in the land, if there is plague, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in any of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;
11¿Õ»ó 8:38 whatever prayer, whatever plea there is from any individual or from all your people Israel, all knowing the afflictions of their own hearts so that they stretch out their hands toward this house;
11¿Õ»ó 8:39 then hear in heaven your dwelling place, forgive, act, and render to all whose hearts you know--according to all their ways, for only you know what is in every human heart--
11¿Õ»ó 8:40 so that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors.
11¿Õ»ó 8:41 "Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a distant land because of your name
11¿Õ»ó 8:42 --for they shall hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm--when a foreigner comes and prays toward this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:43 then hear in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and so that they may know that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built.
11¿Õ»ó 8:44 "If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
11¿Õ»ó 8:45 then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
11¿Õ»ó 8:46 "If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;
11¿Õ»ó 8:47 yet if they come to their senses in the land to which they have been taken captive, and repent, and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, 'We have sinned, and have done wrong; we have acted wickedly';
11¿Õ»ó 8:48 if they repent with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies, who took them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their ancestors, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name;
11¿Õ»ó 8:49 then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, maintain their cause
11¿Õ»ó 8:50 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you; and grant them compassion in the sight of their captors, so that they may have compassion on them
11¿Õ»ó 8:51 (for they are your people and heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron-smelter).
11¿Õ»ó 8:52 Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant, and to the plea of your people Israel, listening to them whenever they call to you.
11¿Õ»ó 8:53 For you have separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your heritage, just as you promised through Moses, your servant, when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, O Lord GOD."
11¿Õ»ó 8:54 Now when Solomon finished offering all this prayer and this plea to the LORD, he arose from facing the altar of the LORD, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven;
11¿Õ»ó 8:55 he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice:
11¿Õ»ó 8:56 "Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel according to all that he promised; not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke through his servant Moses.
11¿Õ»ó 8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our ancestors; may he not leave us or abandon us,
11¿Õ»ó 8:58 but incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our ancestors.
11¿Õ»ó 8:59 Let these words of mine, with which I pleaded before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires;
11¿Õ»ó 8:60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other.
11¿Õ»ó 8:61 Therefore devote yourselves completely to the LORD our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day."
11¿Õ»ó 8:62 Then the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:63 Solomon offered as sacrifices of well-being to the LORD twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:64 The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the sacrifices of well-being, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offerings and the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the sacrifices of well-being.
11¿Õ»ó 8:65 So Solomon held the festival at that time, and all Israel with him--a great assembly, people from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt--before the LORD our God, seven days.
11¿Õ»ó 8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents, joyful and in good spirits because of all the goodness that the LORD had shown to his servant David and to his people Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 9:1 When Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king's house and all that Solomon desired to build,
11¿Õ»ó 9:2 the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
11¿Õ»ó 9:3 The LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you made before me; I have consecrated this house that you have built, and put my name there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
11¿Õ»ó 9:4 As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,
11¿Õ»ó 9:5 then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David, saying, 'There shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 9:6 "If you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,
11¿Õ»ó 9:7 then I will cut Israel off from the land that I have given them; and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a taunt among all peoples.
11¿Õ»ó 9:8 This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this house?'
11¿Õ»ó 9:9 Then they will say, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping them and serving them; therefore the LORD has brought this disaster upon them.'"
11¿Õ»ó 9:10 At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house,
11¿Õ»ó 9:11 King Hiram of Tyre having supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
11¿Õ»ó 9:12 But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.
11¿Õ»ó 9:13 Therefore he said, "What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?" So they are called the land of Cabul to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 9:14 But Hiram had sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.
11¿Õ»ó 9:15 This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the house of the LORD and his own house, the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer
11¿Õ»ó 9:16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it down, had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife;
11¿Õ»ó 9:17 so Solomon rebuilt Gezer), Lower Beth-horon,
11¿Õ»ó 9:18 Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness, within the land,
11¿Õ»ó 9:19 as well as all of Solomon's storage cities, the cities for his chariots, the cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build, in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
11¿Õ»ó 9:20 All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel--
11¿Õ»ó 9:21 their descendants who were still left in the land, whom the Israelites were unable to destroy completely--these Solomon conscripted for slave labor, and so they are to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 9:22 But of the Israelites Solomon made no slaves; they were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, and the commanders of his chariotry and cavalry.
11¿Õ»ó 9:23 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: five hundred fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
11¿Õ»ó 9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.
11¿Õ»ó 9:25 Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being on the altar that he built for the LORD, offering incense before the LORD. So he completed the house.
11¿Õ»ó 9:26 King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
11¿Õ»ó 9:27 Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 9:28 They went to Ophir, and imported from there four hundred twenty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, (fame due to the name of the LORD), she came to test him with hard questions.
11¿Õ»ó 10:2 She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.
11¿Õ»ó 10:3 Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.
11¿Õ»ó 10:4 When the queen of Sheba had observed all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
11¿Õ»ó 10:5 the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his valets, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.
11¿Õ»ó 10:6 So she said to the king, "The report was true that I heard in my own land of your accomplishments and of your wisdom,
11¿Õ»ó 10:7 but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. Not even half had been told me; your wisdom and prosperity far surpass the report that I had heard.
11¿Õ»ó 10:8 Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend you and hear your wisdom!
11¿Õ»ó 10:9 Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king to execute justice and righteousness."
11¿Õ»ó 10:10 Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones; never again did spices come in such quantity as that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:11 Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a great quantity of almug wood and precious stones.
11¿Õ»ó 10:12 From the almug wood the king made supports for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 10:13 Meanwhile King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desire that she expressed, as well as what he gave her out of Solomon's royal bounty. Then she returned to her own land, with her servants.
11¿Õ»ó 10:14 The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
11¿Õ»ó 10:15 besides that which came from the traders and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land.
11¿Õ»ó 10:16 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each large shield.
11¿Õ»ó 10:17 He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:18 The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
11¿Õ»ó 10:19 The throne had six steps. The top of the throne was rounded in the back, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,
11¿Õ»ó 10:20 while twelve lions were standing, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made in any kingdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:21 All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver--it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:22 For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
11¿Õ»ó 10:23 Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:24 The whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
11¿Õ»ó 10:25 Every one of them brought a present, objects of silver and gold, garments, weaponry, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
11¿Õ»ó 10:26 Solomon gathered together chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 10:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as numerous as the sycamores of the Shephelah.
11¿Õ»ó 10:28 Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price.
11¿Õ»ó 10:29 A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
11¿Õ»ó 11:1 King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,
11¿Õ»ó 11:2 from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the Israelites, "You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you; for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods"; Solomon clung to these in love.
11¿Õ»ó 11:3 Among his wives were seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
11¿Õ»ó 11:4 For when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David.
11¿Õ»ó 11:5 For Solomon followed Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
11¿Õ»ó 11:6 So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not completely follow the LORD, as his father David had done.
11¿Õ»ó 11:7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 11:8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who offered incense and sacrificed to their gods.
11¿Õ»ó 11:9 Then the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
11¿Õ»ó 11:10 and had commanded him concerning this matter, that he should not follow other gods; but he did not observe what the LORD commanded.
11¿Õ»ó 11:11 Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this has been your mind and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.
11¿Õ»ó 11:12 Yet for the sake of your father David I will not do it in your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
11¿Õ»ó 11:13 I will not, however, tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
11¿Õ»ó 11:14 Then the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal house in Edom.
11¿Õ»ó 11:15 For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the dead, he killed every male in Edom
11¿Õ»ó 11:16 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had eliminated every male in Edom);
11¿Õ»ó 11:17 but Hadad fled to Egypt with some Edomites who were servants of his father. He was a young boy at that time.
11¿Õ»ó 11:18 They set out from Midian and came to Paran; they took people with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land.
11¿Õ»ó 11:19 Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him his sister-in-law for a wife, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.
11¿Õ»ó 11:20 The sister of Tahpenes gave birth by him to his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the children of Pharaoh.
11¿Õ»ó 11:21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
11¿Õ»ó 11:22 But Pharaoh said to him, "What do you lack with me that you now seek to go to your own country?" And he said, "No, do let me go."
11¿Õ»ó 11:23 God raised up another adversary against Solomon, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah.
11¿Õ»ó 11:24 He gathered followers around him and became leader of a marauding band, after the slaughter by David; they went to Damascus, settled there, and made him king in Damascus.
11¿Õ»ó 11:25 He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, making trouble as Hadad did; he despised Israel and reigned over Aram.
11¿Õ»ó 11:26 Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, rebelled against the king.
11¿Õ»ó 11:27 The following was the reason he rebelled against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
11¿Õ»ó 11:28 The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.
11¿Õ»ó 11:29 About that time, when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah had clothed himself with a new garment. The two of them were alone in the open country
11¿Õ»ó 11:30 when Ahijah laid hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
11¿Õ»ó 11:31 He then said to Jeroboam: Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "See, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes.
11¿Õ»ó 11:32 One tribe will remain his, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 11:33 This is because he has forsaken me, worshiped Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as his father David did.
11¿Õ»ó 11:34 Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom away from him but will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of my servant David whom I chose and who did keep my commandments and my statutes;
11¿Õ»ó 11:35 but I will take the kingdom away from his son and give it to you--that is, the ten tribes.
11¿Õ»ó 11:36 Yet to his son I will give one tribe, so that my servant David may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.
11¿Õ»ó 11:37 I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires; you shall be king over Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 11:38 If you will listen to all that I command you, walk in my ways, and do what is right in my sight by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you an enduring house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
11¿Õ»ó 11:39 For this reason I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever."
11¿Õ»ó 11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam promptly fled to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 11:41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did as well as his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
11¿Õ»ó 11:42 The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
11¿Õ»ó 11:43 Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 12:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
11¿Õ»ó 12:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
11¿Õ»ó 12:3 And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
11¿Õ»ó 12:4 "Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke that he placed on us, and we will serve you."
11¿Õ»ó 12:5 He said to them, "Go away for three days, then come again to me." So the people went away.
11¿Õ»ó 12:6 Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the older men who had attended his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?"
11¿Õ»ó 12:7 They answered him, "If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever."
11¿Õ»ó 12:8 But he disregarded the advice that the older men gave him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and now attended him.
11¿Õ»ó 12:9 He said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"
11¿Õ»ó 12:10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus you should say to this people who spoke to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must lighten it for us'; thus you should say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
11¿Õ»ó 12:11 Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
11¿Õ»ó 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had said, "Come to me again the third day."
11¿Õ»ó 12:13 The king answered the people harshly. He disregarded the advice that the older men had given him
11¿Õ»ó 12:14 and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
11¿Õ»ó 12:15 So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which the LORD had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11¿Õ»ó 12:16 When all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David." So Israel went away to their tents.
11¿Õ»ó 12:17 But Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 12:18 When King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam then hurriedly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 12:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 12:20 When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed the house of David, except the tribe of Judah alone.
11¿Õ»ó 12:21 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen troops to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 12:22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
11¿Õ»ó 12:23 Say to King Rehoboam of Judah, son of Solomon, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
11¿Õ»ó 12:24 "Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your kindred the people of Israel. Let everyone go home, for this thing is from me." So they heeded the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and resided there; he went out from there and built Penuel.
11¿Õ»ó 12:26 Then Jeroboam said to himself, "Now the kingdom may well revert to the house of David.
11¿Õ»ó 12:27 If this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, the heart of this people will turn again to their master, King Rehoboam of Judah; they will kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah."
11¿Õ»ó 12:28 So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. He said to the people, "You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
11¿Õ»ó 12:29 He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
11¿Õ»ó 12:30 And this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one at Bethel and before the other as far as Dan.
11¿Õ»ó 12:31 He also made houses on high places, and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not Levites.
11¿Õ»ó 12:32 Jeroboam appointed a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the festival that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar; so he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.
11¿Õ»ó 12:33 He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he alone had devised; he appointed a festival for the people of Israel, and he went up to the altar to offer incense.
11¿Õ»ó 13:1 While Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel
11¿Õ»ó 13:2 and proclaimed against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, "O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: 'A son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.'"
11¿Õ»ó 13:3 He gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: 'The altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.'"
11¿Õ»ó 13:4 When the king heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him!" But the hand that he stretched out against him withered so that he could not draw it back to himself.
11¿Õ»ó 13:5 The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 13:6 The king said to the man of God, "Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God entreated the LORD; and the king's hand was restored to him, and became as it was before.
11¿Õ»ó 13:7 Then the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and dine, and I will give you a gift."
11¿Õ»ó 13:8 But the man of God said to the king, "If you give me half your kingdom, I will not go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water in this place.
11¿Õ»ó 13:9 For thus I was commanded by the word of the LORD: You shall not eat food, or drink water, or return by the way that you came."
11¿Õ»ó 13:10 So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he had come to Bethel.
11¿Õ»ó 13:11 Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel. One of his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words also that he had spoken to the king, they told to their father.
11¿Õ»ó 13:12 Their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
11¿Õ»ó 13:13 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle a donkey for me." So they saddled a donkey for him, and he mounted it.
11¿Õ»ó 13:14 He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak tree. He said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" He answered, "I am."
11¿Õ»ó 13:15 Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat some food."
11¿Õ»ó 13:16 But he said, "I cannot return with you, or go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water with you in this place;
11¿Õ»ó 13:17 for it was said to me by the word of the LORD: You shall not eat food or drink water there, or return by the way that you came."
11¿Õ»ó 13:18 Then the other said to him, "I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD: Bring him back with you into your house so that he may eat food and drink water." But he was deceiving him.
11¿Õ»ó 13:19 Then the man of God went back with him, and ate food and drank water in his house.
11¿Õ»ó 13:20 As they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;
11¿Õ»ó 13:21 and he proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, "Thus says the LORD: Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God commanded you,
11¿Õ»ó 13:22 but have come back and have eaten food and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, 'Eat no food, and drink no water,' your body shall not come to your ancestral tomb."
11¿Õ»ó 13:23 After the man of God had eaten food and had drunk, they saddled for him a donkey belonging to the prophet who had brought him back.
11¿Õ»ó 13:24 Then as he went away, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.
11¿Õ»ó 13:25 People passed by and saw the body thrown in the road, with the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the town where the old prophet lived.
11¿Õ»ó 13:26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him according to the word that the LORD spoke to him."
11¿Õ»ó 13:27 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle a donkey for me." So they saddled one,
11¿Õ»ó 13:28 and he went and found the body thrown in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey.
11¿Õ»ó 13:29 The prophet took up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
11¿Õ»ó 13:30 He laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, "Alas, my brother!"
11¿Õ»ó 13:31 After he had buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
11¿Õ»ó 13:32 For the saying that he proclaimed by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass."
11¿Õ»ó 13:33 Even after this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who wanted to be priests he consecrated for the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 13:34 This matter became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.
11¿Õ»ó 14:1 At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam fell sick.
11¿Õ»ó 14:2 Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go, disguise yourself, so that it will not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; for the prophet Ahijah is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people.
11¿Õ»ó 14:3 Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what shall happen to the child."
11¿Õ»ó 14:4 Jeroboam's wife did so; she set out and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
11¿Õ»ó 14:5 But the LORD said to Ahijah, "The wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her." When she came, she pretended to be another woman.
11¿Õ»ó 14:6 But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with heavy tidings for you.
11¿Õ»ó 14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because I exalted you from among the people, made you leader over my people Israel,
11¿Õ»ó 14:8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David to give it to you; yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my sight,
11¿Õ»ó 14:9 but you have done evil above all those who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and cast images, provoking me to anger, and have thrust me behind your back;
11¿Õ»ó 14:10 therefore, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will consume the house of Jeroboam, just as one burns up dung until it is all gone.
11¿Õ»ó 14:11 Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs shall eat; and anyone who dies in the open country, the birds of the air shall eat; for the LORD has spoken.'
11¿Õ»ó 14:12 Therefore set out, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
11¿Õ»ó 14:13 All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him; for he alone of Jeroboam's family shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
11¿Õ»ó 14:14 Moreover the LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today, even right now!
11¿Õ»ó 14:15 "The LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; he will root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their ancestors, and scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their sacred poles, provoking the LORD to anger.
11¿Õ»ó 14:16 He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and which he caused Israel to commit."
11¿Õ»ó 14:17 Then Jeroboam's wife got up and went away, and she came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
11¿Õ»ó 14:18 All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant the prophet Ahijah.
11¿Õ»ó 14:19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 14:20 The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; then he slept with his ancestors, and his son Nadab succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 14:21 Now Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
11¿Õ»ó 14:22 Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their ancestors had done.
11¿Õ»ó 14:23 For they also built for themselves high places, pillars, and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree;
11¿Õ»ó 14:24 there were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They committed all the abominations of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 14:25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
11¿Õ»ó 14:26 he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took everything. He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made;
11¿Õ»ó 14:27 so King Rehoboam made shields of bronze instead, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
11¿Õ»ó 14:28 As often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
11¿Õ»ó 14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
11¿Õ»ó 14:30 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
11¿Õ»ó 14:31 Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite. His son Abijam succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
11¿Õ»ó 15:3 He committed all the sins that his father did before him; his heart was not true to the LORD his God, like the heart of his father David.
11¿Õ»ó 15:4 Nevertheless for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem;
11¿Õ»ó 15:5 because David did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
11¿Õ»ó 15:6 The war begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued all the days of his life.
11¿Õ»ó 15:7 The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
11¿Õ»ó 15:8 Abijam slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. Then his son Asa succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 15:9 In the twentieth year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah;
11¿Õ»ó 15:10 he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
11¿Õ»ó 15:11 Asa did what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his father David had done.
11¿Õ»ó 15:12 He put away the male temple prostitutes out of the land, and removed all the idols that his ancestors had made.
11¿Õ»ó 15:13 He also removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for Asherah; Asa cut down her image and burned it at the Wadi Kidron.
11¿Õ»ó 15:14 But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was true to the LORD all his days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:15 He brought into the house of the LORD the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts--silver, gold, and utensils.
11¿Õ»ó 15:16 There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:17 King Baasha of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hands of his servants. King Asa sent them to King Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon son of Hezion of Aram, who resided in Damascus, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 15:19 "Let there be an alliance between me and you, like that between my father and your father: I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go, break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me."
11¿Õ»ó 15:20 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
11¿Õ»ó 15:21 When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and lived in Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:22 Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt: they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building; with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:23 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his power, all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 15:24 Then Asa slept with his ancestors, and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his father David; his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 15:25 Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah; he reigned over Israel two years.
11¿Õ»ó 15:26 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of his ancestor and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit.
11¿Õ»ó 15:27 Baasha son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
11¿Õ»ó 15:28 So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa of Judah, and succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 15:29 As soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam; he left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite--
11¿Õ»ó 15:30 because of the sins of Jeroboam that he committed and that he caused Israel to commit, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 15:32 There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:33 In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah; he reigned twenty-four years.
11¿Õ»ó 15:34 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit.
11¿Õ»ó 16:1 The word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 16:2 "Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have caused my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
11¿Õ»ó 16:3 therefore, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11¿Õ»ó 16:4 Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat."
11¿Õ»ó 16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his power, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:6 Baasha slept with his ancestors, and was buried at Tirzah; and his son Elah succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:7 Moreover the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it.
11¿Õ»ó 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah; he reigned two years.
11¿Õ»ó 16:9 But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was in charge of the palace at Tirzah,
11¿Õ»ó 16:10 Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah, and succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:11 When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he killed all the house of Baasha; he did not leave him a single male of his kindred or his friends.
11¿Õ»ó 16:12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by the prophet Jehu--
11¿Õ»ó 16:13 because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Elah that they committed, and that they caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.
11¿Õ»ó 16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,
11¿Õ»ó 16:16 and the troops who were encamped heard it said, "Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king"; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
11¿Õ»ó 16:17 So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 16:18 When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house; he burned down the king's house over himself with fire, and died--
11¿Õ»ó 16:19 because of the sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for the sin that he committed, causing Israel to sin.
11¿Õ»ó 16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:21 Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
11¿Õ»ó 16:22 But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king.
11¿Õ»ó 16:23 In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel; he reigned for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 16:24 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; he fortified the hill, and called the city that he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
11¿Õ»ó 16:25 Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did more evil than all who were before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in the sins that he caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.
11¿Õ»ó 16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the power that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:28 Omri slept with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria; his son Ahab succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:29 In the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri began to reign over Israel; Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
11¿Õ»ó 16:30 Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:31 And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he took as his wife Jezebel daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:32 He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 16:33 Ahab also made a sacred pole. Ahab did more to provoke the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, than had all the kings of Israel who were before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:34 In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua son of Nun.
11¿Õ»ó 17:1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word."
11¿Õ»ó 17:2 The word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 17:3 "Go from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
11¿Õ»ó 17:4 You shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there."
11¿Õ»ó 17:5 So he went and did according to the word of the LORD; he went and lived by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
11¿Õ»ó 17:6 The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the wadi.
11¿Õ»ó 17:7 But after a while the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
11¿Õ»ó 17:8 Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 17:9 "Go now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live there; for I have commanded a widow there to feed you."
11¿Õ»ó 17:10 So he set out and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, a widow was there gathering sticks; he called to her and said, "Bring me a little water in a vessel, so that I may drink."
11¿Õ»ó 17:11 As she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, "Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand."
11¿Õ»ó 17:12 But she said, "As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die."
11¿Õ»ó 17:13 Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son.
11¿Õ»ó 17:14 For thus says the LORD the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth."
11¿Õ»ó 17:15 She went and did as Elijah said, so that she as well as he and her household ate for many days.
11¿Õ»ó 17:16 The jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.
11¿Õ»ó 17:17 After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
11¿Õ»ó 17:18 She then said to Elijah, "What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!"
11¿Õ»ó 17:19 But he said to her, "Give me your son." He took him from her bosom, carried him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging, and laid him on his own bed.
11¿Õ»ó 17:20 He cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?"
11¿Õ»ó 17:21 Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this child's life come into him again."
11¿Õ»ó 17:22 The LORD listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.
11¿Õ»ó 17:23 Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; then Elijah said, "See, your son is alive."
11¿Õ»ó 17:24 So the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."
11¿Õ»ó 18:1 After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year of the drought, saying, "Go, present yourself to Ahab; I will send rain on the earth."
11¿Õ»ó 18:2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 18:3 Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Now Obadiah revered the LORD greatly;
11¿Õ»ó 18:4 when Jezebel was killing off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets, hid them fifty to a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)
11¿Õ»ó 18:5 Then Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals."
11¿Õ»ó 18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.
11¿Õ»ó 18:7 As Obadiah was on the way, Elijah met him; Obadiah recognized him, fell on his face, and said, "Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
11¿Õ»ó 18:8 He answered him, "It is I. Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here."
11¿Õ»ó 18:9 And he said, "How have I sinned, that you would hand your servant over to Ahab, to kill me?
11¿Õ»ó 18:10 As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my lord has not sent to seek you; and when they would say, 'He is not here,' he would require an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.
11¿Õ»ó 18:11 But now you say, 'Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here.'
11¿Õ»ó 18:12 As soon as I have gone from you, the spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where; so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have revered the LORD from my youth.
11¿Õ»ó 18:13 Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets fifty to a cave, and provided them with bread and water?
11¿Õ»ó 18:14 Yet now you say, 'Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here'; he will surely kill me."
11¿Õ»ó 18:15 Elijah said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today."
11¿Õ»ó 18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
11¿Õ»ó 18:17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is it you, you troubler of Israel?"
11¿Õ»ó 18:18 He answered, "I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father's house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals.
11¿Õ»ó 18:19 Now therefore have all Israel assemble for me at Mount Carmel, with the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
11¿Õ»ó 18:20 So Ahab sent to all the Israelites, and assembled the prophets at Mount Carmel.
11¿Õ»ó 18:21 Elijah then came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him." The people did not answer him a word.
11¿Õ»ó 18:22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets number four hundred fifty.
11¿Õ»ó 18:23 Let two bulls be given to us; let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it.
11¿Õ»ó 18:24 Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the LORD; the god who answers by fire is indeed God." All the people answered, "Well spoken!"
11¿Õ»ó 18:25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; then call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it."
11¿Õ»ó 18:26 So they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, crying, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no voice, and no answer. They limped about the altar that they had made.
11¿Õ»ó 18:27 At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, "Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened."
11¿Õ»ó 18:28 Then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them.
11¿Õ»ó 18:29 As midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice, no answer, and no response.
11¿Õ»ó 18:30 Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come closer to me"; and all the people came closer to him. First he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down;
11¿Õ»ó 18:31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, "Israel shall be your name";
11¿Õ»ó 18:32 with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed.
11¿Õ»ó 18:33 Next he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, "Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood."
11¿Õ»ó 18:34 Then he said, "Do it a second time"; and they did it a second time. Again he said, "Do it a third time"; and they did it a third time,
11¿Õ»ó 18:35 so that the water ran all around the altar, and filled the trench also with water.
11¿Õ»ó 18:36 At the time of the offering of the oblation, the prophet Elijah came near and said, "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your bidding.
11¿Õ»ó 18:37 Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back."
11¿Õ»ó 18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the trench.
11¿Õ»ó 18:39 When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, "The LORD indeed is God; the LORD indeed is God."
11¿Õ»ó 18:40 Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape." Then they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon, and killed them there.
11¿Õ»ó 18:41 Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of rushing rain."
11¿Õ»ó 18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; there he bowed himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees.
11¿Õ»ó 18:43 He said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea." He went up and looked, and said, "There is nothing." Then he said, "Go again seven times."
11¿Õ»ó 18:44 At the seventh time he said, "Look, a little cloud no bigger than a person's hand is rising out of the sea." Then he said, "Go say to Ahab, 'Harness your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"
11¿Õ»ó 18:45 In a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind; there was a heavy rain. Ahab rode off and went to Jezreel.
11¿Õ»ó 18:46 But the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; he girded up his loins and ran in front of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
11¿Õ»ó 19:1 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
11¿Õ»ó 19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow."
11¿Õ»ó 19:3 Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.
11¿Õ»ó 19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: "It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."
11¿Õ»ó 19:5 Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, "Get up and eat."
11¿Õ»ó 19:6 He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again.
11¿Õ»ó 19:7 The angel of the LORD came a second time, touched him, and said, "Get up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you."
11¿Õ»ó 19:8 He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
11¿Õ»ó 19:9 At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there. Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:10 He answered, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away."
11¿Õ»ó 19:11 He said, "Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake;
11¿Õ»ó 19:12 and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence.
11¿Õ»ó 19:13 When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:14 He answered, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away."
11¿Õ»ó 19:15 Then the LORD said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
11¿Õ»ó 19:16 Also you shall anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.
11¿Õ»ó 19:17 Whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.
11¿Õ»ó 19:18 Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him."
11¿Õ»ó 19:19 So he set out from there, and found Elisha son of Shaphat, who was plowing. There were twelve yoke of oxen ahead of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle over him.
11¿Õ»ó 19:20 He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." Then Elijah said to him, "Go back again; for what have I done to you?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:21 He returned from following him, took the yoke of oxen, and slaughtered them; using the equipment from the oxen, he boiled their flesh, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out and followed Elijah, and became his servant.
11¿Õ»ó 20:1 King Ben-hadad of Aram gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were with him, along with horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria, laid siege to it, and attacked it.
11¿Õ»ó 20:2 Then he sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel, and said to him: "Thus says Ben-hadad:
11¿Õ»ó 20:3 Your silver and gold are mine; your fairest wives and children also are mine."
11¿Õ»ó 20:4 The king of Israel answered, "As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have."
11¿Õ»ó 20:5 The messengers came again and said: "Thus says Ben-hadad: I sent to you, saying, 'Deliver to me your silver and gold, your wives and children';
11¿Õ»ó 20:6 nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants, and lay hands on whatever pleases them, and take it away."
11¿Õ»ó 20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, "Look now! See how this man is seeking trouble; for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not refuse him."
11¿Õ»ó 20:8 Then all the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not listen or consent."
11¿Õ»ó 20:9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, "Tell my lord the king: All that you first demanded of your servant I will do; but this thing I cannot do." The messengers left and brought him word again.
11¿Õ»ó 20:10 Ben-hadad sent to him and said, "The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria will provide a handful for each of the people who follow me."
11¿Õ»ó 20:11 The king of Israel answered, "Tell him: One who puts on armor should not brag like one who takes it off."
11¿Õ»ó 20:12 When Ben-hadad heard this message--now he had been drinking with the kings in the booths--he said to his men, "Take your positions!" And they took their positions against the city.
11¿Õ»ó 20:13 Then a certain prophet came up to King Ahab of Israel and said, "Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? Look, I will give it into your hand today; and you shall know that I am the LORD."
11¿Õ»ó 20:14 Ahab said, "By whom?" He said, "Thus says the LORD, By the young men who serve the district governors." Then he said, "Who shall begin the battle?" He answered, "You."
11¿Õ»ó 20:15 Then he mustered the young men who serve the district governors, two hundred thirty-two; after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
11¿Õ»ó 20:16 They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings allied with him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:17 The young men who serve the district governors went out first. Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, and they reported to him, "Men have come out from Samaria."
11¿Õ»ó 20:18 He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."
11¿Õ»ó 20:19 But these had already come out of the city: the young men who serve the district governors, and the army that followed them.
11¿Õ»ó 20:20 Each killed his man; the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-hadad of Aram escaped on a horse with the cavalry.
11¿Õ»ó 20:21 The king of Israel went out, attacked the horses and chariots, and defeated the Arameans with a great slaughter.
11¿Õ»ó 20:22 Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, "Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do; for in the spring the king of Aram will come up against you."
11¿Õ»ó 20:23 The servants of the king of Aram said to him, "Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
11¿Õ»ó 20:24 Also do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in place of them;
11¿Õ»ó 20:25 and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they." He heeded their voice, and did so.
11¿Õ»ó 20:26 In the spring Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 20:27 After the Israelites had been mustered and provisioned, they went out to engage them; the people of Israel encamped opposite them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the country.
11¿Õ»ó 20:28 A man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, "Thus says the LORD: Because the Arameans have said, 'The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,' therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
11¿Õ»ó 20:29 They encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle began; the Israelites killed one hundred thousand Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
11¿Õ»ó 20:30 The rest fled into the city of Aphek; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men that were left. Ben-hadad also fled, and entered the city to hide.
11¿Õ»ó 20:31 His servants said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life."
11¿Õ»ó 20:32 So they tied sackcloth around their waists, put ropes on their heads, went to the king of Israel, and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let me live.'" And he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
11¿Õ»ó 20:33 Now the men were watching for an omen; they quickly took it up from him and said, "Yes, Ben-hadad is your brother." Then he said, "Go and bring him." So Ben-hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.
11¿Õ»ó 20:34 Ben-hadad said to him, "I will restore the towns that my father took from your father; and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." The king of Israel responded, "I will let you go on those terms." So he made a treaty with him and let him go.
11¿Õ»ó 20:35 At the command of the LORD a certain member of a company of prophets said to another, "Strike me!" But the man refused to strike him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:36 Then he said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you have left me, a lion will kill you." And when he had left him, a lion met him and killed him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:37 Then he found another man and said, "Strike me!" So the man hit him, striking and wounding him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:38 Then the prophet departed, and waited for the king along the road, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
11¿Õ»ó 20:39 As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the thick of the battle; then a soldier turned and brought a man to me, and said, 'Guard this man; if he is missing, your life shall be given for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'
11¿Õ»ó 20:40 While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." The king of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it."
11¿Õ»ó 20:41 Then he quickly took the bandage away from his eyes. The king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
11¿Õ»ó 20:42 Then he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have let the man go whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.'"
11¿Õ»ó 20:43 The king of Israel set out toward home, resentful and sullen, and came to Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 21:1 Later the following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 21:2 And Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money."
11¿Õ»ó 21:3 But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance."
11¿Õ»ó 21:4 Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, "I will not give you my ancestral inheritance." He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat.
11¿Õ»ó 21:5 His wife Jezebel came to him and said, "Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?"
11¿Õ»ó 21:6 He said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it'; but he answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
11¿Õ»ó 21:7 His wife Jezebel said to him, "Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11¿Õ»ó 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.
11¿Õ»ó 21:9 She wrote in the letters, "Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly;
11¿Õ»ó 21:10 seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, 'You have cursed God and the king.' Then take him out, and stone him to death."
11¿Õ»ó 21:11 The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them,
11¿Õ»ó 21:12 they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly.
11¿Õ»ó 21:13 The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death.
11¿Õ»ó 21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead."
11¿Õ»ó 21:15 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, "Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11¿Õ»ó 21:16 As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
11¿Õ»ó 21:17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
11¿Õ»ó 21:18 Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.
11¿Õ»ó 21:19 You shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: Have you killed, and also taken possession?" You shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood."
11¿Õ»ó 21:20 Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD,
11¿Õ»ó 21:21 I will bring disaster on you; I will consume you, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;
11¿Õ»ó 21:22 and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.
11¿Õ»ó 21:23 Also concerning Jezebel the LORD said, 'The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the bounds of Jezreel.'
11¿Õ»ó 21:24 Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat."
11¿Õ»ó 21:25 (Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD, urged on by his wife Jezebel.
11¿Õ»ó 21:26 He acted most abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites.)
11¿Õ»ó 21:27 When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over his bare flesh; he fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.
11¿Õ»ó 21:28 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:
11¿Õ»ó 21:29 "Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the disaster on his house."
11¿Õ»ó 22:1 For three years Aram and Israel continued without war.
11¿Õ»ó 22:2 But in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:3 The king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, yet we are doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:4 He said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are; my people are your people, my horses are your horses."
11¿Õ»ó 22:5 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."
11¿Õ»ó 22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred of them, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?" They said, "Go up; for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
11¿Õ»ó 22:7 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no other prophet of the LORD here of whom we may inquire?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:8 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one other by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster." Jehoshaphat said, "Let the king not say such a thing."
11¿Õ»ó 22:9 Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah."
11¿Õ»ó 22:10 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
11¿Õ»ó 22:11 Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, "Thus says the LORD: With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are destroyed."
11¿Õ»ó 22:12 All the prophets were prophesying the same and saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
11¿Õ»ó 22:13 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
11¿Õ»ó 22:14 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, whatever the LORD says to me, that I will speak."
11¿Õ»ó 22:15 When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?" He answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
11¿Õ»ó 22:16 But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:17 Then Micaiah said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, 'These have no master; let each one go home in peace.'"
11¿Õ»ó 22:18 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy anything favorable about me, but only disaster?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:19 Then Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing beside him to the right and to the left of him.
11¿Õ»ó 22:20 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab, so that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' Then one said one thing, and another said another,
11¿Õ»ó 22:21 until a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I will entice him.'
11¿Õ»ó 22:22 'How?' the LORD asked him. He replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then the LORD said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do it.'
11¿Õ»ó 22:23 So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has decreed disaster for you."
11¿Õ»ó 22:24 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up to Micaiah, slapped him on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:25 Micaiah replied, "You will find out on that day when you go in to hide in an inner chamber."
11¿Õ»ó 22:26 The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
11¿Õ»ó 22:27 and say, 'Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him on reduced rations of bread and water until I come in peace.'"
11¿Õ»ó 22:28 Micaiah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, you peoples, all of you!"
11¿Õ»ó 22:29 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
11¿Õ»ó 22:30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
11¿Õ»ó 22:31 Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, "Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel."
11¿Õ»ó 22:32 When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is surely the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out.
11¿Õ»ó 22:33 When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
11¿Õ»ó 22:34 But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; so he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."
11¿Õ»ó 22:35 The battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans, until at evening he died; the blood from the wound had flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
11¿Õ»ó 22:36 Then about sunset a shout went through the army, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"
11¿Õ»ó 22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; they buried the king in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 22:38 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD that he had spoken.
11¿Õ»ó 22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 22:40 So Ahab slept with his ancestors; and his son Ahaziah succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 22:41 Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
11¿Õ»ó 22:43 He walked in all the way of his father Asa; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and offered incense on the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 22:44 Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his power that he showed, and how he waged war, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
11¿Õ»ó 22:46 The remnant of the male temple prostitutes who were still in the land in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated.
11¿Õ»ó 22:47 There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
11¿Õ»ó 22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of the Tarshish type to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
11¿Õ»ó 22:49 Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships," but Jehoshaphat was not willing.
11¿Õ»ó 22:50 Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his father David; his son Jehoram succeeded him.
11¿Õ»ó 22:51 Ahaziah son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah; he reigned two years over Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:52 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
11¿Õ»ó 22:53 He served Baal and worshiped him; he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.
12
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:1 After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:2 Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay injured; so he sent messengers, telling them, "Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Get up, go to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?'
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:4 Now therefore thus says the LORD, 'You shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.'" So Elijah went.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:5 The messengers returned to the king, who said to them, "Why have you returned?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:6 They answered him, "There came a man to meet us, who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him: Thus says the LORD: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but shall surely die.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:7 He said to them, "What sort of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:8 They answered him, "A hairy man, with a leather belt around his waist." He said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:9 Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "O man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:10 But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:11 Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He went up and said to him, "O man of God, this is the king's order: Come down quickly!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:12 But Elijah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:13 Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. So the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and entreated him, "O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:14 Look, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:15 Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he set out and went down with him to the king,
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:16 and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?--therefore you shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:17 So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. His brother, Jehoram succeeded him as king in the second year of King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:1 Now when the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:2 Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:3 The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?" And he said, "Yes, I know; keep silent."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:4 Elijah said to him, "Elisha, stay here; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:5 The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?" And he answered, "Yes, I know; be silent."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:6 Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:7 Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:8 Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:9 When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you." Elisha said, "Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:10 He responded, "You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:11 As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:12 Elisha kept watching and crying out, "Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:13 He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:14 He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:15 When the company of prophets who were at Jericho saw him at a distance, they declared, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:16 They said to him, "See now, we have fifty strong men among your servants; please let them go and seek your master; it may be that the spirit of the LORD has caught him up and thrown him down on some mountain or into some valley." He responded, "No, do not send them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:17 But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send them." So they sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:18 When they came back to him (he had remained at Jericho), he said to them, "Did I not say to you, Do not go?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:19 Now the people of the city said to Elisha, "The location of this city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:20 He said, "Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:21 Then he went to the spring of water and threw the salt into it, and said, "Thus says the LORD, I have made this water wholesome; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:22 So the water has been wholesome to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:23 He went up from there to Bethel; and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, "Go away, baldhead! Go away, baldhead!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:24 When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:25 From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and then returned to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:1 In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria; he reigned twelve years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and mother, for he removed the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:3 Nevertheless he clung to the sin of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to commit; he did not depart from it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:4 Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder, who used to deliver to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:5 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:6 So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:7 As he went he sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you go with me to battle against Moab?" He answered, "I will; I am with you, my people are your people, my horses are your horses."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:8 Then he asked, "By which way shall we march?" Jehoram answered, "By the way of the wilderness of Edom."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out; and when they had made a roundabout march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that were with them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:10 Then the king of Israel said, "Alas! The LORD has summoned us, three kings, only to be handed over to Moab."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?" Then one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah, is here."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:12 Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Go to your father's prophets or to your mother's." But the king of Israel said to him, "No; it is the LORD who has summoned us, three kings, only to be handed over to Moab."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:14 Elisha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, whom I serve, were it not that I have regard for King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would give you neither a look nor a glance.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:15 But get me a musician." And then, while the musician was playing, the power of the LORD came on him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:16 And he said, "Thus says the LORD, 'I will make this wadi full of pools.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:17 For thus says the LORD, 'You shall see neither wind nor rain, but the wadi shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your cattle, and your animals.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:18 This is only a trifle in the sight of the LORD, for he will also hand Moab over to you.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:19 You shall conquer every fortified city and every choice city; every good tree you shall fell, all springs of water you shall stop up, and every good piece of land you shall ruin with stones."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:20 The next day, about the time of the morning offering, suddenly water began to flow from the direction of Edom, until the country was filled with water.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:21 When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the frontier.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:22 When they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:23 They said, "This is blood; the kings must have fought together, and killed one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked the Moabites, who fled before them; as they entered Moab they continued the attack.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:25 The cities they overturned, and on every good piece of land everyone threw a stone, until it was covered; every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled. Only at Kir-hareseth did the stone walls remain, until the slingers surrounded and attacked it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom; but they could not.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:27 Then he took his firstborn son who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And great wrath came upon Israel, so they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:1 Now the wife of a member of the company of prophets cried to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the LORD, but a creditor has come to take my two children as slaves."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:2 Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" She answered, "Your servant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:3 He said, "Go outside, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels and not just a few.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:4 Then go in, and shut the door behind you and your children, and start pouring into all these vessels; when each is full, set it aside."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:5 So she left him and shut the door behind her and her children; they kept bringing vessels to her, and she kept pouring.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:6 When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." But he said to her, "There are no more." Then the oil stopped flowing.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:7 She came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your children can live on the rest."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:8 One day Elisha was passing through Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to have a meal. So whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for a meal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:9 She said to her husband, "Look, I am sure that this man who regularly passes our way is a holy man of God.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:10 Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that he can stay there whenever he comes to us."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:11 One day when he came there, he went up to the chamber and lay down there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:12 He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite woman." When he had called her, she stood before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:13 He said to him, "Say to her, Since you have taken all this trouble for us, what may be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?" She answered, "I live among my own people."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:14 He said, "What then may be done for her?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:15 He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood at the door.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:16 He said, "At this season, in due time, you shall embrace a son." She replied, "No, my lord, O man of God; do not deceive your servant."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:17 The woman conceived and bore a son at that season, in due time, as Elisha had declared to her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:18 When the child was older, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:19 He complained to his father, "Oh, my head, my head!" The father said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:20 He carried him and brought him to his mother; the child sat on her lap until noon, and he died.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:21 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door on him, and left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:22 Then she called to her husband, and said, "Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:23 He said, "Why go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." She said, "It will be all right."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:24 Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Urge the animal on; do not hold back for me unless I tell you."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:25 So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, "Look, there is the Shunammite woman;
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:26 run at once to meet her, and say to her, Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?" She answered, "It is all right."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:27 When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said, "Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:28 Then she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not mislead me?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:29 He said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, give no greeting, and if anyone greets you, do not answer; and lay my staff on the face of the child."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:30 Then the mother of the child said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave without you." So he rose up and followed her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:31 Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. He came back to meet him and told him, "The child has not awakened."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:32 When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:33 So he went in and closed the door on the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:34 Then he got up on the bed and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and while he lay bent over him, the flesh of the child became warm.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:35 He got down, walked once to and fro in the room, then got up again and bent over him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:36 Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite woman." So he called her. When she came to him, he said, "Take your son."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:37 She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took her son and left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:38 When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the company of prophets was sitting before him, he said to his servant, "Put the large pot on, and make some stew for the company of prophets."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:39 One of them went out into the field to gather herbs; he found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew, not knowing what they were.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:40 They served some for the men to eat. But while they were eating the stew, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:41 He said, "Then bring some flour." He threw it into the pot, and said, "Serve the people and let them eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:42 A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing food from the first fruits to the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, "Give it to the people and let them eat."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:43 But his servant said, "How can I set this before a hundred people?" So he repeated, "Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and have some left.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:44 He set it before them, they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:1 Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from leprosy.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:2 Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:3 She said to her mistress, "If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:4 So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:5 And the king of Aram said, "Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel." He went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:6 He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:8 But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the entrance of Elisha's house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:10 Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:11 But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, "I thought that for me he would surely come out, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and would wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy!
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?" He turned and went away in a rage.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:13 But his servants approached and said to him, "Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, 'Wash, and be clean'?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:14 So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:15 Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company; he came and stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel; please accept a present from your servant."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:16 But he said, "As the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will accept nothing!" He urged him to accept, but he refused.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:17 Then Naaman said, "If not, please let two mule-loads of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god except the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:18 But may the LORD pardon your servant on one count: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I do bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant on this one count."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:19 He said to him, "Go in peace." But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:20 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, "My master has let that Aramean Naaman off too lightly by not accepting from him what he offered. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something out of him."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:21 So Gehazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped down from the chariot to meet him and said, "Is everything all right?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:22 He replied, "Yes, but my master has sent me to say, 'Two members of a company of prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim; please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:23 Naaman said, "Please accept two talents." He urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them in front of Gehazi.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:24 When he came to the citadel, he took the bags from them, and stored them inside; he dismissed the men, and they left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:25 He went in and stood before his master; and Elisha said to him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" He answered, "Your servant has not gone anywhere at all."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:26 But he said to him, "Did I not go with you in spirit when someone left his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to accept money and to accept clothing, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves?
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:27 Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you, and to your descendants forever." So he left his presence leprous, as white as snow.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:1 Now the company of prophets said to Elisha, "As you see, the place where we live under your charge is too small for us.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:2 Let us go to the Jordan, and let us collect logs there, one for each of us, and build a place there for us to live." He answered, "Do so."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:3 Then one of them said, "Please come with your servants." And he answered, "I will."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:4 So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:5 But as one was felling a log, his ax head fell into the water; he cried out, "Alas, master! It was borrowed."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:6 Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:7 He said, "Pick it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:8 Once when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he took counsel with his officers. He said, "At such and such a place shall be my camp."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:9 But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, "Take care not to pass this place, because the Arameans are going down there."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:10 The king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God spoke. More than once or twice he warned such a place so that it was on the alert.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:11 The mind of the king of Aram was greatly perturbed because of this; he called his officers and said to them, "Now tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:12 Then one of his officers said, "No one, my lord king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:13 He said, "Go and find where he is; I will send and seize him." He was told, "He is in Dothan."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:14 So he sent horses and chariots there and a great army; they came by night, and surrounded the city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:15 When an attendant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. His servant said, "Alas, master! What shall we do?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:16 He replied, "Do not be afraid, for there are more with us than there are with them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:17 Then Elisha prayed: "O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see." So the LORD opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:18 When the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, "Strike this people, please, with blindness." So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:19 Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he led them to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:20 As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, "O LORD, open the eyes of these men so that they may see." The LORD opened their eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:21 When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, "Father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:22 He answered, "No! Did you capture with your sword and your bow those whom you want to kill? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink; and let them go to their master."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:23 So he prepared for them a great feast; after they ate and drank, he sent them on their way, and they went to their master. And the Arameans no longer came raiding into the land of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:24 Some time later King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army; he marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:25 As the siege continued, famine in Samaria became so great that a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:26 Now as the king of Israel was walking on the city wall, a woman cried out to him, "Help, my lord king!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:27 He said, "No! Let the LORD help you. How can I help you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:28 But then the king asked her, "What is your complaint?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son; we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son and we will eat him.' But she has hidden her son."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:30 When the king heard the words of the woman he tore his clothes--now since he was walking on the city wall, the people could see that he had sackcloth on his body underneath--
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:31 and he said, "So may God do to me, and more, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat stays on his shoulders today."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:32 So he dispatched a man from his presence. Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Are you aware that this murderer has sent someone to take off my head? When the messenger comes, see that you shut the door and hold it closed against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:33 While he was still speaking with them, the king came down to him and said, "This trouble is from the LORD! Why should I hope in the LORD any longer?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:1 But Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a measure of choice meal shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:2 Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, "Even if the LORD were to make windows in the sky, could such a thing happen?" But he said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat from it."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:3 Now there were four leprous men outside the city gate, who said to one another, "Why should we sit here until we die?
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:4 If we say, 'Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall also die. Therefore, let us desert to the Aramean camp; if they spare our lives, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:5 So they arose at twilight to go to the Aramean camp; but when they came to the edge of the Aramean camp, there was no one there at all.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:6 For the Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, "The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to fight against us."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:7 So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys leaving the camp just as it was, and fled for their lives.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:8 When these leprous men had come to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, ate and drank, carried off silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. Then they came back, entered another tent, carried off things from it, and went and hid them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:9 Then they said to one another, "What we are doing is wrong. This is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, we will be found guilty; therefore let us go and tell the king's household."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:10 So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, "We went to the Aramean camp, but there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:11 Then the gatekeepers called out and proclaimed it to the king's household.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:12 The king got up in the night, and said to his servants, "I will tell you what the Arameans have prepared against us. They know that we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:13 One of his servants said, "Let some men take five of the remaining horses, since those left here will suffer the fate of the whole multitude of Israel that have perished already; let us send and find out."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:14 So they took two mounted men, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, "Go and find out."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:15 So they went after them as far as the Jordan; the whole way was littered with garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned, and told the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:16 Then the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a measure of choice meal was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:17 Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; the people trampled him to death in the gate, just as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:18 For when the man of God had said to the king, "Two measures of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of choice meal for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:19 the captain had answered the man of God, "Even if the LORD were to make windows in the sky, could such a thing happen?" And he had answered, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat from it."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:20 It did indeed happen to him; the people trampled him to death in the gate.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:1 Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Get up and go with your household, and settle wherever you can; for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will come on the land for seven years."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:2 So the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God; she went with her household and settled in the land of the Philistines seven years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:3 At the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she set out to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:4 Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, "Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:5 While he was telling the king how Elisha had restored a dead person to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. Gehazi said, "My lord king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:6 When the king questioned the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, "Restore all that was hers, together with all the revenue of the fields from the day that she left the land until now."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:7 Elisha went to Damascus while King Ben-hadad of Aram was ill. When it was told him, "The man of God has come here,"
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:8 the king said to Hazael, "Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God. Inquire of the LORD through him, whether I shall recover from this illness."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, taking a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads. When he entered and stood before him, he said, "Your son King Ben-hadad of Aram has sent me to you, saying, 'Shall I recover from this illness?'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:10 Elisha said to him, "Go, say to him, 'You shall certainly recover'; but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:11 He fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:12 Hazael asked, "Why does my lord weep?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel; you will set their fortresses on fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their pregnant women."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:13 Hazael said, "What is your servant, who is a mere dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Aram."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:14 Then he left Elisha, and went to his master Ben-hadad, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he answered, "He told me that you would certainly recover."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:15 But the next day he took the bed-cover and dipped it in water and spread it over the king's face, until he died. And Hazael succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:16 In the fifth year of King Joram son of Ahab of Israel, Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for the sake of his servant David, since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his descendants forever.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:20 In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:21 Then Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. He set out by night and attacked the Edomites and their chariot commanders who had surrounded him; but his army fled home.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:22 So Edom has been in revolt against the rule of Judah to this day. Libnah also revolted at the same time.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:23 Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:24 So Joram slept with his ancestors, and was buried with them in the city of David; his son Ahaziah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:25 In the twelfth year of King Joram son of Ahab of Israel, Ahaziah son of King Jehoram of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:27 He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab, doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:28 He went with Joram son of Ahab to wage war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, where the Arameans wounded Joram.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:29 King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against King Hazael of Aram. King Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:1 Then the prophet Elisha called a member of the company of prophets and said to him, "Gird up your loins; take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:2 When you arrive, look there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi; go in and get him to leave his companions, and take him into an inner chamber.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:3 Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, 'Thus says the LORD: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee; do not linger."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:4 So the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:5 He arrived while the commanders of the army were in council, and he announced, "I have a message for you, commander." "For which one of us?" asked Jehu. "For you, commander."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:6 So Jehu got up and went inside; the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel: I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:7 You shall strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:10 The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one shall bury her." Then he opened the door and fled.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:11 When Jehu came back to his master's officers, they said to him, "Is everything all right? Why did that madman come to you?" He answered them, "You know the sort and how they babble."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:12 They said, "Liar! Come on, tell us!" So he said, "This is just what he said to me: 'Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:13 Then hurriedly they all took their cloaks and spread them for him on the bare steps; and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, "Jehu is king."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:14 Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against King Hazael of Aram;
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:15 but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him, when he fought against King Hazael of Aram. So Jehu said, "If this is your wish, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, where Joram was lying ill. King Ahaziah of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:17 In Jezreel, the sentinel standing on the tower spied the company of Jehu arriving, and said, "I see a company." Joram said, "Take a horseman; send him to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:18 So the horseman went to meet him; he said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu responded, "What have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me." The sentinel reported, saying, "The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:19 Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu answered, "What have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:20 Again the sentinel reported, "He reached them, but he is not coming back. It looks like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi; for he drives like a maniac."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:21 Joram said, "Get ready." And they got his chariot ready. Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu; they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:22 When Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" He answered, "What peace can there be, so long as the many whoredoms and sorceries of your mother Jezebel continue?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:23 Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, "Treason, Ahaziah!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:24 Jehu drew his bow with all his strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart; and he sank in his chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:25 Jehu said to his aide Bidkar, "Lift him out, and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind his father Ahab how the LORD uttered this oracle against him:
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:26 'For the blood of Naboth and for the blood of his children that I saw yesterday, says the LORD, I swear I will repay you on this very plot of ground.' Now therefore lift him out and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:27 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, saying, "Shoot him also!" And they shot him in the chariot at the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:28 His officers carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:29 In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:31 As Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:32 He looked up to the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:33 He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down; some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, which trampled on her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:34 Then he went in and ate and drank; he said, "See to that cursed woman and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:35 But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:36 When they came back and told him, he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, 'In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:37 the corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung on the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:1 Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:2 "Since your master's sons are with you and you have at your disposal chariots and horses, a fortified city, and weapons,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:3 select the son of your master who is the best qualified, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:4 But they were utterly terrified and said, "Look, two kings could not withstand him; how then can we stand?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:5 So the steward of the palace, and the governor of the city, along with the elders and the guardians, sent word to Jehu: "We are your servants; we will do anything you say. We will not make anyone king; do whatever you think right."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:6 Then he wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time." Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the leaders of the city, who were charged with their upbringing.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:7 When the letter reached them, they took the king's sons and killed them, seventy persons; they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:8 When the messenger came and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," he said, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:9 Then in the morning when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him; but who struck down all these?
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:10 Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD has done what he said through his servant Elijah."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:11 So Jehu killed all who were left of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his leaders, close friends, and priests, until he left him no survivor.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:12 Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:13 Jehu met relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah and said, "Who are you?" They answered, "We are kin of Ahaziah; we have come down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:14 He said, "Take them alive." They took them alive, and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two in all; he spared none of them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:15 When he left there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him; he greeted him, and said to him, "Is your heart as true to mine as mine is to yours?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So he gave him his hand. Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:16 He said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD." So he had him ride in his chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:17 When he came to Samaria, he killed all who were left to Ahab in Samaria, until he had wiped them out, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke to Elijah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:18 Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, "Ahab offered Baal small service; but Jehu will offer much more.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:19 Now therefore summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal; whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:20 Jehu decreed, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." So they proclaimed it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:21 Jehu sent word throughout all Israel; all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was no one left who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, until the temple of Baal was filled from wall to wall.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:22 He said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal." So he brought out the vestments for them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:23 Then Jehu entered the temple of Baal with Jehonadab son of Rechab; he said to the worshipers of Baal, "Search and see that there is no worshiper of the LORD here among you, but only worshipers of Baal."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:24 Then they proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, saying, "Whoever allows any of those to escape whom I deliver into your hands shall forfeit his life."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:25 As soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and to the officers, "Come in and kill them; let no one escape." So they put them to the sword. The guards and the officers threw them out, and then went into the citadel of the temple of Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:26 They brought out the pillar that was in the temple of Baal, and burned it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:27 Then they demolished the pillar of Baal, and destroyed the temple of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:28 Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:29 But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to commit--the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:30 The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what I consider right, and in accordance with all that was in my heart have dealt with the house of Ahab, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:31 But Jehu was not careful to follow the law of the LORD the God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he caused Israel to commit.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:32 In those days the LORD began to trim off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the Wadi Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his power, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:35 So Jehu slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:1 Now when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she set about to destroy all the royal family.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:2 But Jehosheba, King Joram's daughter, Ahaziah's sister, took Joash son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's children who were about to be killed; she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus she hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not killed;
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:3 he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the LORD, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:4 But in the seventh year Jehoiada summoned the captains of the Carites and of the guards and had them come to him in the house of the LORD. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD; then he showed them the king's son.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:5 He commanded them, "This is what you are to do: one-third of you, those who go off duty on the sabbath and guard the king's house
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:6 (another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards), shall guard the palace;
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:7 and your two divisions that come on duty in force on the sabbath and guard the house of the LORD
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:8 shall surround the king, each with weapons in hand; and whoever approaches the ranks is to be killed. Be with the king in his comings and goings."
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:9 The captains did according to all that the priest Jehoiada commanded; each brought his men who were to go off duty on the sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the sabbath, and came to the priest Jehoiada.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:10 The priest delivered to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the LORD;
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:11 the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house, to guard the king on every side.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:12 Then he brought out the king's son, put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; they proclaimed him king, and anointed him; they clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:13 When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the LORD to the people;
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:14 when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:15 Then the priest Jehoiada commanded the captains who were set over the army, "Bring her out between the ranks, and kill with the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest said, "Let her not be killed in the house of the LORD."
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:16 So they laid hands on her; she went through the horses' entrance to the king's house, and there she was put to death.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:17 Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people, that they should be the LORD's people; also between the king and the people.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:18 Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. The priest posted guards over the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:19 He took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land; then they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the gate of the guards to the king's house. He took his seat on the throne of the kings.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:20 So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been killed with the sword at the king's house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:21 Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:2 Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all his days, because the priest Jehoiada instructed him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:3 Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:4 Jehoash said to the priests, "All the money offered as sacred donations that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money for which each person is assessed--the money from the assessment of persons--and the money from the voluntary offerings brought into the house of the LORD,
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:5 let the priests receive from each of the donors; and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered."
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:6 But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had made no repairs on the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:7 Therefore King Jehoash summoned the priest Jehoiada with the other priests and said to them, "Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore do not accept any more money from your donors but hand it over for the repair of the house."
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:8 So the priests agreed that they would neither accept more money from the people nor repair the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:9 Then the priest Jehoiada took a chest, made a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the LORD; the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:10 Whenever they saw that there was a great deal of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest went up, counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and tied it up in bags.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:11 They would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workers who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; then they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD,
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:12 to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the LORD, as well as for any outlay for repairs of the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:13 But for the house of the LORD no basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, were made from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD,
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:14 for that was given to the workers who were repairing the house of the LORD with it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:15 They did not ask an accounting from those into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workers, for they dealt honestly.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:16 The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:17 At that time King Hazael of Aram went up, fought against Gath, and took it. But when Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem,
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:18 King Jehoash of Judah took all the votive gifts that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his ancestors, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, as well as his own votive gifts, all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent these to King Hazael of Aram. Then Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:19 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:20 His servants arose, devised a conspiracy, and killed Joash in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:21 It was Jozacar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. He was buried with his ancestors in the city of David; then his son Amaziah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:1 In the twenty-third year of King Joash son of Ahaziah of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned seventeen years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:3 The anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, so that he gave them repeatedly into the hand of King Hazael of Aram, then into the hand of Ben-hadad son of Hazael.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:4 But Jehoahaz entreated the LORD, and the LORD heeded him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:5 Therefore the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they escaped from the hand of the Arameans; and the people of Israel lived in their homes as formerly.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:6 Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he caused Israel to sin, but walked in them; the sacred pole also remained in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:7 So Jehoahaz was left with an army of not more than fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did, including his might, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:9 So Jehoahaz slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria; then his son Joash succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of King Joash of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned sixteen years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:11 He also did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin, but he walked in them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, as well as the might with which he fought against King Amaziah of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:13 So Joash slept with his ancestors, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:14 Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, King Joash of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, crying, "My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:15 Elisha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows"; so he took a bow and arrows.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:16 Then he said to the king of Israel, "Draw the bow"; and he drew it. Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:17 Then he said, "Open the window eastward"; and he opened it. Elisha said, "Shoot"; and he shot. Then he said, "The LORD's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram! For you shall fight the Arameans in Aphek until you have made an end of them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:18 He continued, "Take the arrows"; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground with them"; he struck three times, and stopped.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:19 Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, "You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Aram until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Aram only three times."
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:20 So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:21 As a man was being buried, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha; as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life and stood on his feet.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:22 Now King Hazael of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:23 But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them; he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them; nor has he banished them from his presence until now.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:24 When King Hazael of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:25 Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took again from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the towns that he had taken from his father Jehoahaz in war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the towns of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:1 In the second year of King Joash son of Joahaz of Israel, King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah, began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:3 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like his ancestor David; in all things he did as his father Joash had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:4 But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:5 As soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had murdered his father the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:6 But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "The parents shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the parents; but all shall be put to death for their own sins."
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:7 He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm; he called it Jokthe-el, which is its name to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:9 King Jehoash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, "A thorn bush on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife'; but a wild animal of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorn bush.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:10 You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:11 But Amaziah would not listen. So King Jehoash of Israel went up; he and King Amaziah of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel; everyone fled home.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:13 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh; he came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:14 He seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, as well as hostages; then he returned to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:15 Now the rest of the acts that Jehoash did, his might, and how he fought with King Amaziah of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:16 Jehoash slept with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; then his son Jeroboam succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:17 King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:18 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:19 They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:20 They brought him on horses; he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the city of David.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:21 All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king to succeed his father Amaziah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:22 He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah, after King Amaziah slept with his ancestors.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:23 In the fifteenth year of King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah, King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel began to reign in Samaria; he reigned forty-one years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:24 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:25 He restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:26 For the LORD saw that the distress of Israel was very bitter; there was no one left, bond or free, and no one to help Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:27 But the LORD had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Joash.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:29 Jeroboam slept with his ancestors, the kings of Israel; his son Zechariah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam of Israel King Azariah son of Amaziah of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:3 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:4 Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:5 The LORD struck the king, so that he was leprous to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham the king's son was in charge of the palace, governing the people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:7 Azariah slept with his ancestors; they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David; his son Jotham succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of King Azariah of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:9 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his ancestors had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:10 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him down in public and killed him, and reigned in place of him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:11 Now the rest of the deeds of Zechariah are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:12 This was the promise of the LORD that he gave to Jehu, "Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." And so it happened.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:13 Shallum son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah of Judah; he reigned one month in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:14 Then Menahem son of Gadi came up from Tirzah and came to Samaria; he struck down Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him; he reigned in place of him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:15 Now the rest of the deeds of Shallum, including the conspiracy that he made, are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:16 At that time Menahem sacked Tiphsah, all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah on; because they did not open it to him, he sacked it. He ripped open all the pregnant women in it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of King Azariah of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi began to reign over Israel; he reigned ten years in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:18 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:19 King Pul of Assyria came against the land; Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, so that he might help him confirm his hold on the royal power.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:20 Menahem exacted the money from Israel, that is, from all the wealthy, fifty shekels of silver from each one, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:21 Now the rest of the deeds of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:22 Menahem slept with his ancestors, and his son Pekahiah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:23 In the fiftieth year of King Azariah of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned two years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:24 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:25 Pekah son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him with fifty of the Gileadites, and attacked him in Samaria, in the citadel of the palace along with Argob and Arieh; he killed him, and reigned in place of him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:26 Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiah, and all that he did, are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:27 In the fifty-second year of King Azariah of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned twenty years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:28 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:29 In the days of King Pekah of Israel, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried the people captive to Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:30 Then Hoshea son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remaliah, attacked him, and killed him; he reigned in place of him, in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:32 In the second year of King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel, King Jotham son of Uzziah of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:34 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:35 Nevertheless the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:37 In those days the LORD began to send King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:38 Jotham slept with his ancestors, and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, his ancestor; his son Ahaz succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, King Ahaz son of Jotham of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his ancestor David had done,
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:3 but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even made his son pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:4 He sacrificed and made offerings on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:5 Then King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel came up to wage war on Jerusalem; they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:6 At that time the king of Edom recovered Elath for Edom, and drove the Judeans from Elath; and the Edomites came to Elath, where they live to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:7 Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come up, and rescue me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:8 Ahaz also took the silver and gold found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:9 The king of Assyria listened to him; the king of Assyria marched up against Damascus, and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir; then he killed Rezin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:10 When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. King Ahaz sent to the priest Uriah a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:11 The priest Uriah built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, just so did the priest Uriah build it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:12 When the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. Then the king drew near to the altar, went up on it,
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:13 and offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured his drink offering, and dashed the blood of his offerings of well-being against the altar.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:14 The bronze altar that was before the LORD he removed from the front of the house, from the place between his altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of his altar.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:15 King Ahaz commanded the priest Uriah, saying, "Upon the great altar offer the morning burnt offering, and the evening grain offering, and the king's burnt offering, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offering; then dash against it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by."
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:16 The priest Uriah did everything that King Ahaz commanded.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:17 Then King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands, and removed the laver from them; he removed the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pediment of stone.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:18 The covered portal for use on the sabbath that had been built inside the palace, and the outer entrance for the king he removed from the house of the LORD. He did this because of the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:20 Ahaz slept with his ancestors, and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David; his son Hezekiah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:1 In the twelfth year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel; he reigned nine years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not like the kings of Israel who were before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:3 King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against him; Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:4 But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to King So of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria confined him and imprisoned him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:5 Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria; for three years he besieged it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria; he carried the Israelites away to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:7 This occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:8 and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had introduced.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:9 The people of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the LORD their God. They built for themselves high places at all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:10 they set up for themselves pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:11 there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. They did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:12 they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, "You shall not do this."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:13 Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:14 They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:15 They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their ancestors, and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false; they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do as they did.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:16 They rejected all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves cast images of two calves; they made a sacred pole, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:17 They made their sons and their daughters pass through fire; they used divination and augury; and they sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:19 Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:20 The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:21 When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit great sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:22 The people of Israel continued in all the sins that Jeroboam committed; they did not depart from them
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:23 until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had foretold through all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:24 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria in place of the people of Israel; they took possession of Samaria, and settled in its cities.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:25 When they first settled there, they did not worship the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:26 So the king of Assyria was told, "The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them; they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, "Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there; let him go and live there, and teach them the law of the god of the land."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel; he taught them how they should worship the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:29 But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the shrines of the high places that the people of Samaria had made, every nation in the cities in which they lived;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:30 the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people of Cuth made Nergal, the people of Hamath made Ashima;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:31 the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:32 They also worshiped the LORD and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:33 So they worshiped the LORD but also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:34 To this day they continue to practice their former customs. They do not worship the LORD and they do not follow the statutes or the ordinances or the law or the commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:35 The LORD had made a covenant with them and commanded them, "You shall not worship other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them,
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:36 but you shall worship the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm; you shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:37 The statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to observe. You shall not worship other gods;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:38 you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not worship other gods,
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:39 but you shall worship the LORD your God; he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:40 They would not listen, however, but they continued to practice their former custom.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:41 So these nations worshiped the LORD, but also served their carved images; to this day their children and their children's children continue to do as their ancestors did.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:1 In the third year of King Hoshea son of Elah of Israel, Hezekiah son of King Ahaz of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi daughter of Zechariah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:3 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD just as his ancestor David had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:4 He removed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the sacred pole. He broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it; it was called Nehushtan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:5 He trusted in the LORD the God of Israel; so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him, or among those who were before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:6 For he held fast to the LORD; he did not depart from following him but kept the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:7 The LORD was with him; wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:8 He attacked the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of King Hoshea son of Elah of Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against Samaria, besieged it,
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:10 and at the end of three years, took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of King Hoshea of Israel, Samaria was taken.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:11 The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria, settled them in Halah, on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:12 because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed his covenant--all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded; they neither listened nor obeyed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:14 King Hezekiah of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong; withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear." The king of Assyria demanded of King Hezekiah of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:15 Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:16 At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the doorposts that King Hezekiah of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:17 The king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Fuller's Field.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:18 When they called for the king, there came out to them Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebnah the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:19 The Rabshakeh said to them, "Say to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you base this confidence of yours?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:20 Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:21 See, you are relying now on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:22 But if you say to me, 'We rely on the LORD our God,' is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:23 Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:24 How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:25 Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in the Aramaic language, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:27 But the Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the people sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:28 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:29 Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:30 Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the LORD by saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:31 Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: 'Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat from your own vine and your own fig tree, and drink water from your own cistern,
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, The LORD will deliver us.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:33 Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered its land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:35 Who among all the gods of the countries have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:36 But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:37 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:3 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:4 It may be that the LORD your God heard all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left."
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:6 Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:7 I myself will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:8 The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:9 When the king heard concerning King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, "See, he has set out to fight against you," he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:10 "Thus shall you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:11 See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my predecessors destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: "O LORD the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:16 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:17 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:18 and have hurled their gods into the fire, though they were no gods but the work of human hands--wood and stone--and so they were destroyed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:19 So now, O LORD our God, save us, I pray you, from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone."
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:20 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:21 This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: She despises you, she scorns you--virgin daughter Zion; she tosses her head--behind your back, daughter Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:22 Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:23 By your messengers you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, 'With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon; I felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses; I entered its farthest retreat, its densest forest.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:24 I dug wells and drank foreign waters, I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:25 Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:26 while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded; they have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:27 "But I know your rising and your sitting, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:28 Because you have raged against me and your arrogance has come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth; I will turn you back on the way by which you came.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:29 "And this shall be the sign for you: This year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that; then in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:30 The surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:31 for from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out, and from Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:32 "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, shoot an arrow there, come before it with a shield, or cast up a siege-ramp against it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:33 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return; he shall not come into this city, says the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:34 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:35 That very night the angel of the LORD set out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; when morning dawned, they were all dead bodies.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:36 Then King Sennacherib of Assyria left, went home, and lived at Nineveh.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:37 As he was worshiping in the house of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. His son Esar-haddon succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD:
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:3 "Remember now, O LORD, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." Hezekiah wept bitterly.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:4 Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him:
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:5 "Turn back, and say to Hezekiah prince of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; indeed, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:6 I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Bring a lump of figs. Let them take it and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:8 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:9 Isaiah said, "This is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has promised: the shadow has now advanced ten intervals; shall it retreat ten intervals?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:10 Hezekiah answered, "It is normal for the shadow to lengthen ten intervals; rather let the shadow retreat ten intervals."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:11 The prophet Isaiah cried to the LORD; and he brought the shadow back the ten intervals, by which the sun had declined on the dial of Ahaz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:12 At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:13 Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:14 Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, "What did these men say? From where did they come to you?" Hezekiah answered, "They have come from a far country, from Babylon."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:15 He said, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD:
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:17 Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:18 Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." For he thought, "Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:20 The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah, all his power, how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:21 Hezekiah slept with his ancestors; and his son Manasseh succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following the abominable practices of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:3 For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:4 He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put my name."
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:5 He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:6 He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:7 The carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the LORD said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:8 I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land that I gave to their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:9 But they did not listen; Manasseh misled them to do more evil than the nations had done that the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:10 The LORD said by his servants the prophets,
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:11 "Because King Manasseh of Judah has committed these abominations, has done things more wicked than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has caused Judah also to sin with his idols;
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:12 therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such evil that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line for Samaria, and the plummet for the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:14 I will cast off the remnant of my heritage, and give them into the hand of their enemies; they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:15 because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, even to this day."
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he caused Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:18 Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza. His son Amon succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:20 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:21 He walked in all the way in which his father walked, served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them;
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:22 he abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:23 The servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:24 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in place of him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:26 He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza; then his son Josiah succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:2 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:3 In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the LORD, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:4 "Go up to the high priest Hilkiah, and have him count the entire sum of the money that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people;
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:5 let it be given into the hand of the workers who have the oversight of the house of the LORD; let them give it to the workers who are at the house of the LORD, repairing the house,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:6 that is, to the carpenters, to the builders, to the masons; and let them use it to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:7 But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:8 The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." When Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, he read it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:9 Then Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workers who have oversight of the house of the LORD."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:10 Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "The priest Hilkiah has given me a book." Shaphan then read it aloud to the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:11 When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:12 Then the king commanded the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and the king's servant Asaiah, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:13 "Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:14 So the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; she resided in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter, where they consulted her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:15 She declared to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:16 Thus says the LORD, I will indeed bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants--all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:17 Because they have abandoned me and have made offerings to other gods, so that they have provoked me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:18 But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:19 because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:20 Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place." They took the message back to the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:1 Then the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:2 The king went up to the house of the LORD, and with him went all the people of Judah, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:3 The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:4 The king commanded the high priest Hilkiah, the priests of the second order, and the guardians of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:5 He deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who made offerings to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the host of the heavens.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:6 He brought out the image of Asherah from the house of the LORD, outside Jerusalem, to the Wadi Kidron, burned it at the Wadi Kidron, beat it to dust and threw the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:7 He broke down the houses of the male temple prostitutes that were in the house of the LORD, where the women did weaving for Asherah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:8 He brought all the priests out of the towns of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beer-sheba; he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on the left at the gate of the city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:9 The priests of the high places, however, did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but ate unleavened bread among their kindred.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:10 He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, so that no one would make a son or a daughter pass through fire as an offering to Molech.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:11 He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the LORD, by the chamber of the eunuch Nathan-melech, which was in the precincts; then he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:12 The altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, he pulled down from there and broke in pieces, and threw the rubble into the Wadi Kidron.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:13 The king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Destruction, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:14 He broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the sacred poles, and covered the sites with human bones.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:15 Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin--he pulled down that altar along with the high place. He burned the high place, crushing it to dust; he also burned the sacred pole.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:16 As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the LORD that the man of God proclaimed, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the festival; he turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:17 Then he said, "What is that monument that I see?" The people of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:18 He said, "Let him rest; let no one move his bones." So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:19 Moreover, Josiah removed all the shrines of the high places that were in the towns of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the LORD to anger; he did to them just as he had done at Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:20 He slaughtered on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:21 The king commanded all the people, "Keep the passover to the LORD your God as prescribed in this book of the covenant."
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:22 No such passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah;
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:23 but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this passover was kept to the LORD in Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:24 Moreover Josiah put away the mediums, wizards, teraphim, idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he established the words of the law that were written in the book that the priest Hilkiah had found in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:25 Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:26 Still the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:27 The LORD said, "I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel; and I will reject this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went to meet him; but when Pharaoh Neco met him at Megiddo, he killed him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:30 His servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:32 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his ancestors had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:33 Pharaoh Neco confined him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed tribute on the land of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:34 Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away; he came to Egypt, and died there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land in order to meet Pharaoh's demand for money. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, from all according to their assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:37 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as all his ancestors had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:1 In his days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up; Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:2 The LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, bands of the Arameans, bands of the Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites; he sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servants the prophets.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:3 Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the LORD, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, for all that he had committed,
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:4 and also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was not willing to pardon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:5 Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors; then his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:7 The king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken over all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Wadi of Egypt to the River Euphrates.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:9 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:10 At that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:11 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:12 King Jehoiachin of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself, his mother, his servants, his officers, and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign;
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:13 he carried off all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the LORD, which King Solomon of Israel had made, all this as the LORD had foretold.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:14 He carried away all Jerusalem, all the officials, all the warriors, ten thousand captives, all the artisans and the smiths; no one remained, except the poorest people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:15 He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; the king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the elite of the land, he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:16 The king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, seven thousand, the artisans and the smiths, one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:17 The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:19 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:20 Indeed, Jerusalem and Judah so angered the LORD that he expelled them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:1 And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it; they built siegeworks against it all around.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:2 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:3 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine became so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:4 Then a breach was made in the city wall; the king with all the soldiers fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They went in the direction of the Arabah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; all his army was scattered, deserting him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:6 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence on him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:7 They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah; they bound him in fetters and took him to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month--which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon--Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:9 He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:10 All the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:11 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon--all the rest of the population.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:12 But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and tillers of the soil.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:13 The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, as well as the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:14 They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the dishes for incense, and all the bronze vessels used in the temple service,
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:15 as well as the firepans and the basins. What was made of gold the captain of the guard took away for the gold, and what was made of silver, for the silver.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:16 As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weighing.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and on it was a bronze capital; the height of the capital was three cubits; latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, were on the capital all around. The second pillar had the same, with the latticework.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:18 The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah, the second priest Zephaniah, and the three guardians of the threshold;
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:19 from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the soldiers, and five men of the king's council who were found in the city; the secretary who was the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:20 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:21 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile out of its land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:22 He appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:23 Now when all the captains of the forces and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:24 Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid because of the Chaldean officials; live in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:25 But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men; they struck down Gedaliah so that he died, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:26 Then all the people, high and low and the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison;
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:28 he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the other seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:29 So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes. Every day of his life he dined regularly in the king's presence.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:30 For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, a portion every day, as long as he lived.

13´ë»ó 9:1 So all Israel was enrolled by genealogies; and these are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. And Judah was taken into exile in Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
13´ë»ó 9:2 Now the first to live again in their possessions in their towns were Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants.
13´ë»ó 9:3 And some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem:

13´ë»ó 9:14 Of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

13´ë»ó 9:16 and Obadiah son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah son of Asa, son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.
13´ë»ó 9:17 The gatekeepers were: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman; and their kindred Shallum was the chief,
13´ë»ó 9:18 stationed previously in the king's gate on the east side. These were the gatekeepers of the camp of the Levites.
13´ë»ó 9:19 Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kindred of his ancestral house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, guardians of the thresholds of the tent, as their ancestors had been in charge of the camp of the LORD, guardians of the entrance.
13´ë»ó 9:20 And Phinehas son of Eleazar was chief over them in former times; the LORD was with him.
13´ë»ó 9:21 Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
13´ë»ó 9:22 All these, who were chosen as gatekeepers at the thresholds, were two hundred twelve. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. David and the seer Samuel established them in their office of trust.
13´ë»ó 9:23 So they and their descendants were in charge of the gates of the house of the LORD, that is, the house of the tent, as guards.
13´ë»ó 9:24 The gatekeepers were on the four sides, east, west, north, and south;
13´ë»ó 9:25 and their kindred who were in their villages were obliged to come in every seven days, in turn, to be with them;
13´ë»ó 9:26 for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in charge of the chambers and the treasures of the house of God.
13´ë»ó 9:27 And they would spend the night near the house of God; for on them lay the duty of watching, and they had charge of opening it every morning.
13´ë»ó 9:28 Some of them had charge of the utensils of service, for they were required to count them when they were brought in and taken out.
13´ë»ó 9:29 Others of them were appointed over the furniture, and over all the holy utensils, also over the choice flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the spices.
13´ë»ó 9:30 Others, of the sons of the priests, prepared the mixing of the spices,
13´ë»ó 9:31 and Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of making the flat cakes.
13´ë»ó 9:32 Also some of their kindred of the Kohathites had charge of the rows of bread, to prepare them for each sabbath.
13´ë»ó 9:33 Now these are the singers, the heads of ancestral houses of the Levites, living in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty day and night.
13´ë»ó 9:34 These were heads of ancestral houses of the Levites, according to their generations; these leaders lived in Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 9:35 In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife was Maacah.
13´ë»ó 9:36 His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
13´ë»ó 9:37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth;
13´ë»ó 9:38 and Mikloth became the father of Shimeam; and these also lived opposite their kindred in Jerusalem, with their kindred.
13´ë»ó 9:39 Ner became the father of Kish, Kish of Saul, Saul of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal;
13´ë»ó 9:40 and the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal became the father of Micah.
13´ë»ó 9:41 The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz;
13´ë»ó 9:42 and Ahaz became the father of Jarah, and Jarah of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri became the father of Moza.
13´ë»ó 9:43 Moza became the father of Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
13´ë»ó 9:44 Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.
13´ë»ó 10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
13´ë»ó 10:2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, sons of Saul.
13´ë»ó 10:3 The battle pressed hard on Saul; and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
13´ë»ó 10:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, so that these uncircumcised may not come and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer was unwilling, for he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
13´ë»ó 10:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.
13´ë»ó 10:6 Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
13´ë»ó 10:7 When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; and the Philistines came and occupied them.
13´ë»ó 10:8 The next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
13´ë»ó 10:9 They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
13´ë»ó 10:10 They put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
13´ë»ó 10:11 But when all Jabesh-gilead heard everything that the Philistines had done to Saul,
13´ë»ó 10:12 all the valiant warriors got up and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
13´ë»ó 10:13 So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance,
13´ë»ó 10:14 and did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
13´ë»ó 11:1 Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, "See, we are your bone and flesh.
13´ë»ó 11:2 For some time now, even while Saul was king, it was you who commanded the army of Israel. The LORD your God said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over my people Israel."
13´ë»ó 11:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
13´ë»ó 11:4 David and all Israel marched to Jerusalem, that is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
13´ë»ó 11:5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, now the city of David.
13´ë»ó 11:6 David had said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander." And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
13´ë»ó 11:7 David resided in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
13´ë»ó 11:8 He built the city all around, from the Millo in complete circuit; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
13´ë»ó 11:9 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.
13´ë»ó 11:10 Now these are the chiefs of David's warriors, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
13´ë»ó 11:11 This is an account of David's mighty warriors: Jashobeam, son of Hachmoni, was chief of the Three; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he killed at one time.
13´ë»ó 11:12 And next to him among the three warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
13´ë»ó 11:13 He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley. Now the people had fled from the Philistines,
13´ë»ó 11:14 but he and David took their stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.
13´ë»ó 11:15 Three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, while the army of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
13´ë»ó 11:16 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
13´ë»ó 11:17 David said longingly, "O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
13´ë»ó 11:18 Then the Three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and they brought it to David. But David would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,
13´ë»ó 11:19 and said, "My God forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. The three warriors did these things.
13´ë»ó 11:20 Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Thirty. With his spear he fought against three hundred and killed them, and won a name beside the Three.
13´ë»ó 11:21 He was the most renowned of the Thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the Three.
13´ë»ó 11:22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
13´ë»ó 11:23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam; but Benaiah went against him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
13´ë»ó 11:24 Such were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and he won a name beside the three warriors.
13´ë»ó 11:25 He was renowned among the Thirty, but he did not attain to the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
13´ë»ó 11:26 The warriors of the armies were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
13´ë»ó 11:27 Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pelonite,
13´ë»ó 11:28 Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, Abiezer of Anathoth,
13´ë»ó 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
13´ë»ó 11:30 Maharai of Netophah, Heled son of Baanah of Netophah,
13´ë»ó 11:31 Ithai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah of Pirathon,
13´ë»ó 11:32 Hurai of the wadis of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
13´ë»ó 11:33 Azmaveth of Baharum, Eliahba of Shaalbon,
13´ë»ó 11:34 Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
13´ë»ó 11:35 Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
13´ë»ó 11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
13´ë»ó 11:37 Hezro of Carmel, Naarai son of Ezbai,
13´ë»ó 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
13´ë»ó 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
13´ë»ó 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
13´ë»ó 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
13´ë»ó 11:42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
13´ë»ó 11:43 Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
13´ë»ó 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
13´ë»ó 11:45 Jediael son of Shimri, and his brother Joha the Tizite,
13´ë»ó 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
13´ë»ó 11:47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
13´ë»ó 12:1 The following are those who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul son of Kish; they were among the mighty warriors who helped him in war.
13´ë»ó 12:2 They were archers, and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right hand or the left; they were Benjaminites, Saul's kindred.
13´ë»ó 12:3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; also Jeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of Anathoth,
13´ë»ó 12:4 Ishmaiah of Gibeon, a warrior among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad of Gederah,
13´ë»ó 12:5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
13´ë»ó 12:6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
13´ë»ó 12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
13´ë»ó 12:8 From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness mighty and experienced warriors, expert with shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and who were swift as gazelles on the mountains:
13´ë»ó 12:9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third,
13´ë»ó 12:10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
13´ë»ó 12:11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
13´ë»ó 12:12 Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
13´ë»ó 12:13 Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh.
13´ë»ó 12:14 These Gadites were officers of the army, the least equal to a hundred and the greatest to a thousand.
13´ë»ó 12:15 These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
13´ë»ó 12:16 Some Benjaminites and Judahites came to the stronghold to David.
13´ë»ó 12:17 David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in friendship, to help me, then my heart will be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, though my hands have done no wrong, then may the God of our ancestors see and give judgment."
13´ë»ó 12:18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said, "We are yours, O David; and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to the one who helps you! For your God is the one who helps you." Then David received them, and made them officers of his troops.
13´ë»ó 12:19 Some of the Manassites deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, "He will desert to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.")
13´ë»ó 12:20 As he went to Ziklag these Manassites deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of the thousands in Manasseh.
13´ë»ó 12:21 They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all warriors and commanders in the army.
13´ë»ó 12:22 Indeed from day to day people kept coming to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
13´ë»ó 12:23 These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 12:24 The people of Judah bearing shield and spear numbered six thousand eight hundred armed troops.
13´ë»ó 12:25 Of the Simeonites, mighty warriors, seven thousand one hundred.
13´ë»ó 12:26 Of the Levites four thousand six hundred.
13´ë»ó 12:27 Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred.
13´ë»ó 12:28 Zadok, a young warrior, and twenty-two commanders from his own ancestral house.
13´ë»ó 12:29 Of the Benjaminites, the kindred of Saul, three thousand, of whom the majority had continued to keep their allegiance to the house of Saul.
13´ë»ó 12:30 Of the Ephraimites, twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty warriors, notables in their ancestral houses.
13´ë»ó 12:31 Of the half-tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, who were expressly named to come and make David king.
13´ë»ó 12:32 Of Issachar, those who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, two hundred chiefs, and all their kindred under their command.
13´ë»ó 12:33 Of Zebulun, fifty thousand seasoned troops, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war, to help David with singleness of purpose.
13´ë»ó 12:34 Of Naphtali, a thousand commanders, with whom there were thirty-seven thousand armed with shield and spear.
13´ë»ó 12:35 Of the Danites, twenty-eight thousand six hundred equipped for battle.
13´ë»ó 12:36 Of Asher, forty thousand seasoned troops ready for battle.
13´ë»ó 12:37 Of the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh from beyond the Jordan, one hundred twenty thousand armed with all the weapons of war.
13´ë»ó 12:38 All these, warriors arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with full intent to make David king over all Israel; likewise all the rest of Israel were of a single mind to make David king.
13´ë»ó 12:39 They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their kindred had provided for them.
13´ë»ó 12:40 And also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen--abundant provisions of meal, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
13´ë»ó 13:1 David consulted with the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, with every leader.
13´ë»ó 13:2 David said to the whole assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our kindred who remain in all the land of Israel, including the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasture lands, that they may come together to us.
13´ë»ó 13:3 Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we did not turn to it in the days of Saul."
13´ë»ó 13:4 The whole assembly agreed to do so, for the thing pleased all the people.
13´ë»ó 13:5 So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
13´ë»ó 13:6 And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the LORD, who is enthroned on the cherubim, which is called by his name.
13´ë»ó 13:7 They carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart.
13´ë»ó 13:8 David and all Israel were dancing before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
13´ë»ó 13:9 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen shook it.
13´ë»ó 13:10 The anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; he struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark; and he died there before God.
13´ë»ó 13:11 David was angry because the LORD had burst out against Uzzah; so that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day.
13´ë»ó 13:12 David was afraid of God that day; he said, "How can I bring the ark of God into my care?"
13´ë»ó 13:13 So David did not take the ark into his care into the city of David; he took it instead to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
13´ë»ó 13:14 The ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months, and the LORD blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.
13´ë»ó 14:1 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, and masons and carpenters to build a house for him.
13´ë»ó 14:2 David then perceived that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
13´ë»ó 14:3 David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters.
13´ë»ó 14:4 These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, and Nathan; Solomon,
13´ë»ó 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpelet;
13´ë»ó 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia;
13´ë»ó 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
13´ë»ó 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them.
13´ë»ó 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
13´ë»ó 14:10 David inquired of God, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?" The LORD said to him, "Go up, and I will give them into your hand."
13´ë»ó 14:11 So he went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, "God has burst out against my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood." Therefore that place is called Baal-perazim.
13´ë»ó 14:12 They abandoned their gods there, and at David's command they were burned.
13´ë»ó 14:13 Once again the Philistines made a raid in the valley.
13´ë»ó 14:14 When David again inquired of God, God said to him, "You shall not go up after them; go around and come on them opposite the balsam trees.
13´ë»ó 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
13´ë»ó 14:16 David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
13´ë»ó 14:17 The fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him on all nations.
13´ë»ó 15:1 David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
13´ë»ó 15:2 Then David commanded that no one but the Levites were to carry the ark of God, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever.
13´ë»ó 15:3 David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.
13´ë»ó 15:4 Then David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
13´ë»ó 15:5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with one hundred twenty of his kindred;
13´ë»ó 15:6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with two hundred twenty of his kindred;
13´ë»ó 15:7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with one hundred thirty of his kindred;
13´ë»ó 15:8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with two hundred of his kindred;
13´ë»ó 15:9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with eighty of his kindred;
13´ë»ó 15:10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with one hundred twelve of his kindred.
13´ë»ó 15:11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
13´ë»ó 15:12 He said to them, "You are the heads of families of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your kindred, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
13´ë»ó 15:13 Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God burst out against us, because we did not give it proper care."
13´ë»ó 15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
13´ë»ó 15:15 And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 15:16 David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their kindred as the singers to play on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise loud sounds of joy.
13´ë»ó 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; and of his kindred Asaph son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their kindred, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
13´ë»ó 15:18 and with them their kindred of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
13´ë»ó 15:19 The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound bronze cymbals;
13´ë»ó 15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
13´ë»ó 15:21 but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
13´ë»ó 15:22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music, for he understood it.
13´ë»ó 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
13´ë»ó 15:24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
13´ë»ó 15:25 So David and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of the thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
13´ë»ó 15:26 And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
13´ë»ó 15:27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers; and David wore a linen ephod.
13´ë»ó 15:28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.
13´ë»ó 15:29 As the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing; and she despised him in her heart.
13´ë»ó 16:1 They brought in the ark of God, and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being before God.
13´ë»ó 16:2 When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD;
13´ë»ó 16:3 and he distributed to every person in Israel--man and woman alike--to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
13´ë»ó 16:4 He appointed certain of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
13´ë»ó 16:5 Asaph was the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
13´ë»ó 16:6 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly, before the ark of the covenant of God.
13´ë»ó 16:7 Then on that day David first appointed the singing of praises to the LORD by Asaph and his kindred.
13´ë»ó 16:8 O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples.
13´ë»ó 16:9 Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works.
13´ë»ó 16:10 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
13´ë»ó 16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually.
13´ë»ó 16:12 Remember the wonderful works he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
13´ë»ó 16:13 O offspring of his servant Israel, children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
13´ë»ó 16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
13´ë»ó 16:15 Remember his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
13´ë»ó 16:16 the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
13´ë»ó 16:17 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
13´ë»ó 16:18 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."
13´ë»ó 16:19 When they were few in number, of little account, and strangers in the land,
13´ë»ó 16:20 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
13´ë»ó 16:21 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
13´ë»ó 16:22 saying, "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
13´ë»ó 16:23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Tell of his salvation from day to day.
13´ë»ó 16:24 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
13´ë»ó 16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be revered above all gods.
13´ë»ó 16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
13´ë»ó 16:27 Honor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his place.
13´ë»ó 16:28 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
13´ë»ó 16:29 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come before him. Worship the LORD in holy splendor;
13´ë»ó 16:30 tremble before him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it shall never be moved.
13´ë»ó 16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, "The LORD is king!"
13´ë»ó 16:32 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; let the field exult, and everything in it.
13´ë»ó 16:33 Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
13´ë»ó 16:34 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.
13´ë»ó 16:35 Say also: "Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather and rescue us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.
13´ë»ó 16:36 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting." Then all the people said "Amen!" and praised the LORD.
13´ë»ó 16:37 David left Asaph and his kinsfolk there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister regularly before the ark as each day required,
13´ë»ó 16:38 and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight kinsfolk; while Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.
13´ë»ó 16:39 And he left the priest Zadok and his kindred the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,
13´ë»ó 16:40 to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the LORD that he commanded Israel.
13´ë»ó 16:41 With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to render thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever.
13´ë»ó 16:42 Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music, and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.
13´ë»ó 16:43 Then all the people departed to their homes, and David went home to bless his household.
13´ë»ó 17:1 Now when David settled in his house, David said to the prophet Nathan, "I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."
13´ë»ó 17:2 Nathan said to David, "Do all that you have in mind, for God is with you."
13´ë»ó 17:3 But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying:
13´ë»ó 17:4 Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the LORD: You shall not build me a house to live in.
13´ë»ó 17:5 For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought out Israel to this very day, but I have lived in a tent and a tabernacle.
13´ë»ó 17:6 Wherever I have moved about among all Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
13´ë»ó 17:7 Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people Israel;
13´ë»ó 17:8 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
13´ë»ó 17:9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall wear them down no more, as they did formerly,
13´ë»ó 17:10 from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.
13´ë»ó 17:11 When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
13´ë»ó 17:12 He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
13´ë»ó 17:13 I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,
13´ë»ó 17:14 but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.
13´ë»ó 17:15 In accordance with all these words and all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
13´ë»ó 17:16 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
13´ë»ó 17:17 And even this was a small thing in your sight, O God; you have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come. You regard me as someone of high rank, O LORD God!
13´ë»ó 17:18 And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know your servant.
13´ë»ó 17:19 For your servant's sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all these great deeds, making known all these great things.
13´ë»ó 17:20 There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
13´ë»ó 17:21 Who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and terrible things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt?
13´ë»ó 17:22 And you made your people Israel to be your people forever; and you, O LORD, became their God.
13´ë»ó 17:23 "And now, O LORD, as for the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as you have promised.
13´ë»ó 17:24 Thus your name will be established and magnified forever in the saying, 'The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God'; and the house of your servant David will be established in your presence.
13´ë»ó 17:25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him; therefore your servant has found it possible to pray before you.
13´ë»ó 17:26 And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant;
13´ë»ó 17:27 therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you. For you, O LORD, have blessed and are blessed forever."
13´ë»ó 18:1 Some time afterward, David attacked the Philistines and subdued them; he took Gath and its villages from the Philistines.
13´ë»ó 18:2 He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became subject to David and brought tribute.
13´ë»ó 18:3 David also struck down King Hadadezer of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to set up a monument at the river Euphrates.
13´ë»ó 18:4 David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand cavalry, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left one hundred of them.
13´ë»ó 18:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Arameans.
13´ë»ó 18:6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became subject to David, and brought tribute. The LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
13´ë»ó 18:7 David took the gold shields that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 18:8 From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a vast quantity of bronze; with it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
13´ë»ó 18:9 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of King Hadadezer of Zobah,
13´ë»ó 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him. Now Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. He sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze;
13´ë»ó 18:11 these also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
13´ë»ó 18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13´ë»ó 18:13 He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became subject to David. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
13´ë»ó 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and equity to all his people.
13´ë»ó 18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
13´ë»ó 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary;
13´ë»ó 18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.
13´ë»ó 19:1 Some time afterward, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him.
13´ë»ó 19:2 David said, "I will deal loyally with Hanun son of Nahash, for his father dealt loyally with me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. When David's servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him,
13´ë»ó 19:3 the officials of the Ammonites said to Hanun, "Do you think, because David has sent consolers to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"
13´ë»ó 19:4 So Hanun seized David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at their hips, and sent them away;
13´ë»ó 19:5 and they departed. When David was told about the men, he sent messengers to them, for they felt greatly humiliated. The king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."
13´ë»ó 19:6 When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah.
13´ë»ó 19:7 They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
13´ë»ó 19:8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the warriors.
13´ë»ó 19:9 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
13´ë»ó 19:10 When Joab saw that the line of battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans;
13´ë»ó 19:11 the rest of his troops he put in the charge of his brother Abishai, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
13´ë»ó 19:12 He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.
13´ë»ó 19:13 Be strong, and let us be courageous for our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what seems good to him."
13´ë»ó 19:14 So Joab and the troops who were with him advanced toward the Arameans for battle; and they fled before him.
13´ë»ó 19:15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 19:16 But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
13´ë»ó 19:17 When David was informed, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, came to them, and drew up his forces against them. When David set the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him.
13´ë»ó 19:18 The Arameans fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers, and also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
13´ë»ó 19:19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites any more.
13´ë»ó 20:1 In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led out the army, ravaged the country of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah, and overthrew it.
13´ë»ó 20:2 David took the crown of Milcom from his head; he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. He also brought out the booty of the city, a very great amount.
13´ë»ó 20:3 He brought out the people who were in it, and set them to work with saws and iron picks and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 20:4 After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and the Philistines were subdued.
13´ë»ó 20:5 Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
13´ë»ó 20:6 Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great size, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; he also was descended from the giants.
13´ë»ó 20:7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
13´ë»ó 20:8 These were descended from the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his servants.
13´ë»ó 21:1 Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to count the people of Israel.
13´ë»ó 21:2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, so that I may know their number."
13´ë»ó 21:3 But Joab said, "May the LORD increase the number of his people a hundredfold! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"
13´ë»ó 21:4 But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 21:5 Joab gave the total count of the people to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred seventy thousand who drew the sword.
13´ë»ó 21:6 But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
13´ë»ó 21:7 But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
13´ë»ó 21:8 David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, I pray you, take away the guilt of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
13´ë»ó 21:9 The LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
13´ë»ó 21:10 "Go and say to David, 'Thus says the LORD: Three things I offer you; choose one of them, so that I may do it to you.'"
13´ë»ó 21:11 So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Take your choice:
13´ë»ó 21:12 either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I shall return to the one who sent me."
13´ë»ó 21:13 Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but let me not fall into human hands."
13´ë»ó 21:14 So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand persons fell in Israel.
13´ë»ó 21:15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about to destroy it, the LORD took note and relented concerning the calamity; he said to the destroying angel, "Enough! Stay your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13´ë»ó 21:16 David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
13´ë»ó 21:17 And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave the command to count the people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house; but do not let your people be plagued!"
13´ë»ó 21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to tell David that he should go up and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13´ë»ó 21:19 So David went up following Gad's instructions, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 21:20 Ornan turned and saw the angel; and while his four sons who were with him hid themselves, Ornan continued to thresh wheat.
13´ë»ó 21:21 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he went out from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground.
13´ë»ó 21:22 David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD--give it to me at its full price--so that the plague may be averted from the people."
13´ë»ó 21:23 Then Ornan said to David, "Take it; and let my lord the king do what seems good to him; see, I present the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I give it all."
13´ë»ó 21:24 But King David said to Ornan, "No; I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
13´ë»ó 21:25 So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.
13´ë»ó 21:26 David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and offerings of well-being. He called upon the LORD, and he answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
13´ë»ó 21:27 Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
13´ë»ó 21:28 At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there.
13´ë»ó 21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon;
13´ë»ó 21:30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 22:1 Then David said, "Here shall be the house of the LORD God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel."
13´ë»ó 22:2 David gave orders to gather together the aliens who were residing in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
13´ë»ó 22:3 David also provided great stores of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
13´ë»ó 22:4 and cedar logs without number--for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
13´ë»ó 22:5 For David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorified throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparation for it." So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.
13´ë»ó 22:6 Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
13´ë»ó 22:7 David said to Solomon, "My son, I had planned to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.
13´ë»ó 22:8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood in my sight on the earth.
13´ë»ó 22:9 See, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
13´ë»ó 22:10 He shall build a house for my name. He shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.'
13´ë»ó 22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
13´ë»ó 22:12 Only, may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding, so that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
13´ë»ó 22:13 Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed.
13´ë»ó 22:14 With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone too I have provided. To these you must add more.
13´ë»ó 22:15 You have an abundance of workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of artisans without number, skilled in working
13´ë»ó 22:16 gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you."
13´ë»ó 22:17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon, saying,
13´ë»ó 22:18 "Is not the LORD your God with you? Has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.
13´ë»ó 22:19 Now set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Go and build the sanctuary of the LORD God so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the LORD."
13´ë»ó 23:1 When David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
13´ë»ó 23:2 David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
13´ë»ó 23:3 The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were counted, and the total was thirty-eight thousand.
13´ë»ó 23:4 "Twenty-four thousand of these," David said, "shall have charge of the work in the house of the LORD, six thousand shall be officers and judges,
13´ë»ó 23:5 four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand shall offer praises to the LORD with the instruments that I have made for praise."
13´ë»ó 23:6 And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
13´ë»ó 23:7 The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.
13´ë»ó 23:8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three.
13´ë»ó 23:9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of families of Ladan.
13´ë»ó 23:10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
13´ë»ó 23:11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled as a single family.
13´ë»ó 23:12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
13´ë»ó 23:13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, so that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the LORD, and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever;
13´ë»ó 23:14 but as for Moses the man of God, his sons were to be reckoned among the tribe of Levi.
13´ë»ó 23:15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
13´ë»ó 23:16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
13´ë»ó 23:17 The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief; Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
13´ë»ó 23:18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
13´ë»ó 23:19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
13´ë»ó 23:20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.
13´ë»ó 23:21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
13´ë»ó 23:22 Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kindred, the sons of Kish, married them.
13´ë»ó 23:23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
13´ë»ó 23:24 These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses, the heads of families as they were enrolled according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 23:25 For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he resides in Jerusalem forever.
13´ë»ó 23:26 And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service"--
13´ë»ó 23:27 for according to the last words of David these were the number of the Levites from twenty years old and upward--
13´ë»ó 23:28 "but their duty shall be to assist the descendants of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God;
13´ë»ó 23:29 to assist also with the rows of bread, the choice flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size.
13´ë»ó 23:30 And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the LORD, and likewise at evening,
13´ë»ó 23:31 and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the LORD on sabbaths, new moons, and appointed festivals, according to the number required of them, regularly before the LORD.
13´ë»ó 23:32 Thus they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and shall attend the descendants of Aaron, their kindred, for the service of the house of the LORD."
13´ë»ó 24:1 The divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
13´ë»ó 24:3 Along with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service.
13´ë»ó 24:4 Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of ancestral houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:5 They organized them by lot, all alike, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:6 The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king, and the officers, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of ancestral houses of the priests and of the Levites; one ancestral house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen for Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
13´ë»ó 24:8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
13´ë»ó 24:9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
13´ë»ó 24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
13´ë»ó 24:11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
13´ë»ó 24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
13´ë»ó 24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
13´ë»ó 24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
13´ë»ó 24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
13´ë»ó 24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
13´ë»ó 24:17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
13´ë»ó 24:18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
13´ë»ó 24:19 These had as their appointed duty in their service to enter the house of the LORD according to the procedure established for them by their ancestor Aaron, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
13´ë»ó 24:20 And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
13´ë»ó 24:21 Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
13´ë»ó 24:22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
13´ë»ó 24:23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
13´ë»ó 24:24 The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
13´ë»ó 24:25 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
13´ë»ó 24:26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno.
13´ë»ó 24:27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
13´ë»ó 24:28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
13´ë»ó 24:29 Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.
13´ë»ó 24:30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their ancestral houses.
13´ë»ó 24:31 These also cast lots corresponding to their kindred, the descendants of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of ancestral houses of the priests and of the Levites, the chief as well as the youngest brother.
13´ë»ó 25:1 David and the officers of the army also set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was:
13´ë»ó 25:2 Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king.
13´ë»ó 25:3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the lyre in thanksgiving and praise to the LORD.

13´ë»ó 25:5 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer, according to the promise of God to exalt him; for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
13´ë»ó 25:6 They were all under the direction of their father for the music in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the order of the king.
13´ë»ó 25:7 They and their kindred, who were trained in singing to the LORD, all of whom were skillful, numbered two hundred eighty-eight.
13´ë»ó 25:8 And they cast lots for their duties, small and great, teacher and pupil alike.
13´ë»ó 25:9 The first lot fell for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, to him and his brothers and his sons, twelve;

13´ë»ó 26:7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers were able men, Elihu and Semachiah.
13´ë»ó 26:8 All these, sons of Obed-edom with their sons and brothers, were able men qualified for the service; sixty-two of Obed-edom.
13´ë»ó 26:9 Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, able men, eighteen.

13´ë»ó 26:11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah totaled thirteen.
13´ë»ó 26:12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, corresponding to their leaders, had duties, just as their kindred did, ministering in the house of the LORD;
13´ë»ó 26:13 and they cast lots by ancestral houses, small and great alike, for their gates.
13´ë»ó 26:14 The lot for the east fell to Shelemiah. They cast lots also for his son Zechariah, a prudent counselor, and his lot came out for the north.
13´ë»ó 26:15 Obed-edom's came out for the south, and to his sons was allotted the storehouse.
13´ë»ó 26:16 For Shuppim and Hosah it came out for the west, at the gate of Shallecheth on the ascending road. Guard corresponded to guard.
13´ë»ó 26:17 On the east there were six Levites each day, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, as well as two and two at the storehouse;

13´ë»ó 26:26 This Shelomoth and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries of the dedicated gifts that King David, and the heads of families, and the officers of the thousands and the hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had dedicated.
13´ë»ó 26:27 From booty won in battles they dedicated gifts for the maintenance of the house of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 26:28 Also all that Samuel the seer, and Saul son of Kish, and Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated--all dedicated gifts were in the care of Shelomoth and his brothers.

13´ë»ó 26:32 King David appointed him and his brothers, two thousand seven hundred men of ability, heads of families, to have the oversight of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites for everything pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.

13´ë»ó 27:22 for Dan, Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
13´ë»ó 27:23 David did not count those below twenty years of age, for the LORD had promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars of heaven.
13´ë»ó 27:24 Joab son of Zeruiah began to count them, but did not finish; yet wrath came upon Israel for this, and the number was not entered into the account of the Annals of King David.
13´ë»ó 27:25 Over the king's treasuries was Azmaveth son of Adiel. Over the treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the villages and in the towers, was Jonathan son of Uzziah.
13´ë»ó 27:26 Over those who did the work of the field, tilling the soil, was Ezri son of Chelub.
13´ë»ó 27:27 Over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite. Over the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.
13´ë»ó 27:28 Over the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah was Baal-hanan the Gederite. Over the stores of oil was Joash.
13´ë»ó 27:29 Over the herds that pastured in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite. Over the herds in the valleys was Shaphat son of Adlai.
13´ë»ó 27:30 Over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite. Over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite. Over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.
13´ë»ó 27:31 All these were stewards of King David's property.
13´ë»ó 27:32 Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, being a man of understanding and a scribe; Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended the king's sons.
13´ë»ó 27:33 Ahithophel was the king's counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.
13´ë»ó 27:34 After Ahithophel came Jehoiada son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was commander of the king's army.
13´ë»ó 28:1 David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of the thousands, the commanders of the hundreds, the stewards of all the property and cattle of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the mighty warriors, and all the warriors.
13´ë»ó 28:2 Then King David rose to his feet and said: "Hear me, my brothers and my people. I had planned to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, for the footstool of our God; and I made preparations for building.
13´ë»ó 28:3 But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name, for you are a warrior and have shed blood.'
13´ë»ó 28:4 Yet the LORD God of Israel chose me from all my ancestral house to be king over Israel forever; for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father's house, and among my father's sons he took delight in making me king over all Israel.
13´ë»ó 28:5 And of all my sons, for the LORD has given me many, he has chosen my son Solomon to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
13´ë»ó 28:6 He said to me, 'It is your son Solomon who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will be a father to him.
13´ë»ó 28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues resolute in keeping my commandments and my ordinances, as he is today.'
13´ë»ó 28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and search out all the commandments of the LORD your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.
13´ë»ó 28:9 "And you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him with single mind and willing heart; for the LORD searches every mind, and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will abandon you forever.
13´ë»ó 28:10 Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary; be strong, and act."
13´ë»ó 28:11 Then David gave his son Solomon the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
13´ë»ó 28:12 and the plan of all that he had in mind: for the courts of the house of the LORD, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts;
13´ë»ó 28:13 for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the LORD; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the LORD,
13´ë»ó 28:14 the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service,
13´ë»ó 28:15 the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each in the service,
13´ë»ó 28:16 the weight of gold for each table for the rows of bread, the silver for the silver tables,
13´ë»ó 28:17 and pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;
13´ë»ó 28:18 for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 28:19 "All this, in writing at the LORD's direction, he made clear to me--the plan of all the works."
13´ë»ó 28:20 David said further to his son Solomon, "Be strong and of good courage, and act. Do not be afraid or dismayed; for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
13´ë»ó 28:21 Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every volunteer who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."
13´ë»ó 29:1 King David said to the whole assembly, "My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great; for the temple will not be for mortals but for the LORD God.
13´ë»ó 29:2 So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones, and marble in abundance.
13´ë»ó 29:3 Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:
13´ë»ó 29:4 three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,
13´ë»ó 29:5 and for all the work to be done by artisans, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating themselves today to the LORD?"
13´ë»ó 29:6 Then the leaders of ancestral houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.
13´ë»ó 29:7 They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
13´ë»ó 29:8 Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, into the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
13´ë»ó 29:9 Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with single mind they had offered freely to the LORD; King David also rejoiced greatly.
13´ë»ó 29:10 Then David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly; David said: "Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of our ancestor Israel, forever and ever.
13´ë»ó 29:11 Yours, O LORD, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
13´ë»ó 29:12 Riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might; and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
13´ë»ó 29:13 And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your glorious name.
13´ë»ó 29:14 "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to make this freewill offering? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
13´ë»ó 29:15 For we are aliens and transients before you, as were all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.
13´ë»ó 29:16 O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.
13´ë»ó 29:17 I know, my God, that you search the heart, and take pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
13´ë»ó 29:18 O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
13´ë»ó 29:19 Grant to my son Solomon that with single mind he may keep your commandments, your decrees, and your statutes, performing all of them, and that he may build the temple for which I have made provision."
13´ë»ó 29:20 Then David said to the whole assembly, "Bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king.
13´ë»ó 29:21 On the next day they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the LORD, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their libations, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel;
13´ë»ó 29:22 and they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great joy. They made David's son Solomon king a second time; they anointed him as the LORD's prince, and Zadok as priest.
13´ë»ó 29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD, succeeding his father David as king; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
13´ë»ó 29:24 All the leaders and the mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
13´ë»ó 29:25 The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
13´ë»ó 29:26 Thus David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
13´ë»ó 29:27 The period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 29:28 He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and his son Solomon succeeded him.
13´ë»ó 29:29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the records of the seer Samuel, and in the records of the prophet Nathan, and in the records of the seer Gad,
13´ë»ó 29:30 with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the events that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the earth.
14
14´ëÇÏ 1:1 Solomon son of David established himself in his kingdom; the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
14´ëÇÏ 1:2 Solomon summoned all Israel, the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, the judges, and all the leaders of all Israel, the heads of families.
14´ëÇÏ 1:3 Then Solomon, and the whole assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God's tent of meeting, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.
14´ëÇÏ 1:4 (But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)
14´ëÇÏ 1:5 Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there in front of the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly inquired at it.
14´ëÇÏ 1:6 Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
14´ëÇÏ 1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, "Ask what I should give you."
14´ëÇÏ 1:8 Solomon said to God, "You have shown great and steadfast love to my father David, and have made me succeed him as king.
14´ëÇÏ 1:9 O LORD God, let your promise to my father David now be fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
14´ëÇÏ 1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of yours?"
14´ëÇÏ 1:11 God answered Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king,
14´ëÇÏ 1:12 wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."
14´ëÇÏ 1:13 So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 1:14 Solomon gathered together chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 1:15 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
14´ëÇÏ 1:16 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the king's traders received them from Kue at the prevailing price.
14´ëÇÏ 1:17 They imported from Egypt, and then exported, a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; so through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
14´ëÇÏ 2:1 Solomon decided to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 2:2 Solomon conscripted seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country, with three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
14´ëÇÏ 2:3 Solomon sent word to King Huram of Tyre: "Once you dealt with my father David and sent him cedar to build himself a house to live in.
14´ëÇÏ 2:4 I am now about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for offering fragrant incense before him, and for the regular offering of the rows of bread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed festivals of the LORD our God, as ordained forever for Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 2:5 The house that I am about to build will be great, for our God is greater than other gods.
14´ëÇÏ 2:6 But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?
14´ëÇÏ 2:7 So now send me an artisan skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to join the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.
14´ëÇÏ 2:8 Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting Lebanon timber. My servants will work with your servants
14´ëÇÏ 2:9 to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am about to build will be great and wonderful.
14´ëÇÏ 2:10 I will provide for your servants, those who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14´ëÇÏ 2:11 Then King Huram of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, "Because the LORD loves his people he has made you king over them."
14´ëÇÏ 2:12 Huram also said, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 2:13 "I have dispatched Huram-abi, a skilled artisan, endowed with understanding,
14´ëÇÏ 2:14 the son of one of the Danite women, his father a Tyrian. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your artisans, the artisans of my lord, your father David.
14´ëÇÏ 2:15 Now, as for the wheat, barley, oil, and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send them to his servants.
14´ëÇÏ 2:16 We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you as rafts by sea to Joppa; you will take it up to Jerusalem."
14´ëÇÏ 2:17 Then Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were residing in the land of Israel, after the census that his father David had taken; and there were found to be one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
14´ëÇÏ 2:18 Seventy thousand of them he assigned as laborers, eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to make the people work.
14´ëÇÏ 3:1 Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had designated, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
14´ëÇÏ 3:2 He began to build on the second day of the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
14´ëÇÏ 3:3 These are Solomon's measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 3:4 The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, across the width of the house; and its height was one hundred twenty cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:5 The nave he lined with cypress, covered it with fine gold, and made palms and chains on it.
14´ëÇÏ 3:6 He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold from Parvaim.
14´ëÇÏ 3:7 So he lined the house with gold--its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
14´ëÇÏ 3:8 He made the most holy place; its length, corresponding to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:9 The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:10 In the most holy place he made two carved cherubim and overlaid them with gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:11 The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, five cubits long, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub;
14´ëÇÏ 3:12 and of this cherub, one wing, five cubits long, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also five cubits long, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.
14´ëÇÏ 3:13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits; the cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave.
14´ëÇÏ 3:14 And Solomon made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and worked cherubim into it.
14´ëÇÏ 3:15 In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.
14´ëÇÏ 3:16 He made encircling chains and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
14´ëÇÏ 3:17 He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right, the other on the left; the one on the right he called Jachin, and the one on the left, Boaz.
14´ëÇÏ 4:1 He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.
14´ëÇÏ 4:2 Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from rim to rim, and five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely.
14´ëÇÏ 4:3 Under it were panels all around, each of ten cubits, surrounding the sea; there were two rows of panels, cast when it was cast.
14´ëÇÏ 4:4 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set on them. The hindquarters of each were toward the inside.
14´ëÇÏ 4:5 Its thickness was a handbreadth; its rim was made like the rim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held three thousand baths.
14´ëÇÏ 4:6 He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the right side, and five on the left. In these they were to rinse what was used for the burnt offering. The sea was for the priests to wash in.
14´ëÇÏ 4:7 He made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
14´ëÇÏ 4:8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold.
14´ëÇÏ 4:9 He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court; he overlaid their doors with bronze.
14´ëÇÏ 4:10 He set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
14´ëÇÏ 4:11 And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. Thus Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:
14´ëÇÏ 4:12 the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
14´ëÇÏ 4:13 the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
14´ëÇÏ 4:14 He made the stands, the basins on the stands,
14´ëÇÏ 4:15 the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.
14´ëÇÏ 4:16 The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 4:17 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
14´ëÇÏ 4:18 Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
14´ëÇÏ 4:19 So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,
14´ëÇÏ 4:20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;
14´ëÇÏ 4:21 the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;
14´ëÇÏ 4:22 the snuffers, basins, ladles, and firepans, of pure gold. As for the entrance to the temple: the inner doors to the most holy place and the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.
14´ëÇÏ 5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
14´ëÇÏ 5:3 And all the Israelites assembled before the king at the festival that is in the seventh month.
14´ëÇÏ 5:4 And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites carried the ark.
14´ëÇÏ 5:5 So they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.
14´ëÇÏ 5:6 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be numbered or counted.
14´ëÇÏ 5:7 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.
14´ëÇÏ 5:8 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.
14´ëÇÏ 5:9 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; they are there to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel after they came out of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 5:11 Now when the priests came out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to their divisions,
14´ëÇÏ 5:12 and all the levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kindred, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with one hundred twenty priests who were trumpeters).
14´ëÇÏ 5:13 It was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD, and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever," the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,
14´ëÇÏ 5:14 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 6:1 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would reside in thick darkness.
14´ëÇÏ 6:2 I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to reside in forever."
14´ëÇÏ 6:3 Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
14´ëÇÏ 6:4 And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 6:5 'Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, so that my name might be there, and I chose no one as ruler over my people Israel;
14´ëÇÏ 6:6 but I have chosen Jerusalem in order that my name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'
14´ëÇÏ 6:7 My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 6:8 But the LORD said to my father David, 'You did well to consider building a house for my name;
14´ëÇÏ 6:9 nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'
14´ëÇÏ 6:10 Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made; for I have succeeded my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 6:11 There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel."
14´ëÇÏ 6:12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands.
14´ëÇÏ 6:13 Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court; and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 6:14 He said, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant in steadfast love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart--
14´ëÇÏ 6:15 you who have kept for your servant, my father David, what you promised to him. Indeed, you promised with your mouth and this day have fulfilled with your hand.
14´ëÇÏ 6:16 Therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant, my father David, that which you promised him, saying, 'There shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children keep to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.'
14´ëÇÏ 6:17 Therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant David.
14´ëÇÏ 6:18 "But will God indeed reside with mortals on earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!
14´ëÇÏ 6:19 Regard your servant's prayer and his plea, O LORD my God, heeding the cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you.
14´ëÇÏ 6:20 May your eyes be open day and night toward this house, the place where you promised to set your name, and may you heed the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.
14´ëÇÏ 6:21 And hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place; may you hear from heaven your dwelling place; hear and forgive.
14´ëÇÏ 6:22 "If someone sins against another and is required to take an oath and comes and swears before your altar in this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:23 may you hear from heaven, and act, and judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing their conduct on their own head, and vindicating those who are in the right by rewarding them in accordance with their righteousness.
14´ëÇÏ 6:24 "When your people Israel, having sinned against you, are defeated before an enemy but turn again to you, confess your name, pray and plead with you in this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:25 may you hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 6:26 "When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and then they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin, because you punish them,
14´ëÇÏ 6:27 may you hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send down rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.
14´ëÇÏ 6:28 "If there is famine in the land, if there is plague, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in any of the settlements of the lands; whatever suffering, whatever sickness there is;
14´ëÇÏ 6:29 whatever prayer, whatever plea from any individual or from all your people Israel, all knowing their own suffering and their own sorrows so that they stretch out their hands toward this house;
14´ëÇÏ 6:30 may you hear from heaven, your dwelling place, forgive, and render to all whose heart you know, according to all their ways, for only you know the human heart.
14´ëÇÏ 6:31 Thus may they fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 6:32 "Likewise when foreigners, who are not of your people Israel, come from a distant land because of your great name, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:33 may you hear from heaven your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigners ask of you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built.
14´ëÇÏ 6:34 "If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
14´ëÇÏ 6:35 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
14´ëÇÏ 6:36 "If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near;
14´ëÇÏ 6:37 then if they come to their senses in the land to which they have been taken captive, and repent, and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned, and have done wrong; we have acted wickedly';
14´ëÇÏ 6:38 if they repent with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity, to which they were taken captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their ancestors, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,
14´ëÇÏ 6:39 then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
14´ëÇÏ 6:40 Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to prayer from this place.
14´ëÇÏ 6:41 "Now rise up, O LORD God, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. Let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your faithful rejoice in your goodness.
14´ëÇÏ 6:42 O LORD God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember your steadfast love for your servant David."
14´ëÇÏ 7:1 When Solomon had ended his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
14´ëÇÏ 7:2 The priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's house.
14´ëÇÏ 7:3 When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever."
14´ëÇÏ 7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 7:5 King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 7:6 The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD--for his steadfast love endures forever--whenever David offered praises by their ministry. Opposite them the priests sounded trumpets; and all Israel stood.
14´ëÇÏ 7:7 Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the offerings of well-being because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat parts.
14´ëÇÏ 7:8 At that time Solomon held the festival for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 7:9 On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they had observed the dedication of the altar seven days and the festival seven days.
14´ëÇÏ 7:10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and in good spirits because of the goodness that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house; all that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished.
14´ëÇÏ 7:12 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: "I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
14´ëÇÏ 7:13 When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,
14´ëÇÏ 7:14 if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
14´ëÇÏ 7:15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
14´ëÇÏ 7:16 For now I have chosen and consecrated this house so that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
14´ëÇÏ 7:17 As for you, if you walk before me, as your father David walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,
14´ëÇÏ 7:18 then I will establish your royal throne, as I made covenant with your father David saying, 'You shall never lack a successor to rule over Israel.'
14´ëÇÏ 7:19 "But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,
14´ëÇÏ 7:20 then I will pluck you up from the land that I have given you; and this house, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
14´ëÇÏ 7:21 And regarding this house, now exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished, and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this house?'
14´ëÇÏ 7:22 Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD the God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore he has brought all this calamity upon them.'"
14´ëÇÏ 8:1 At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,
14´ëÇÏ 8:2 Solomon rebuilt the cities that Huram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.
14´ëÇÏ 8:3 Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and captured it.
14´ëÇÏ 8:4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage towns that he built in Hamath.
14´ëÇÏ 8:5 He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars,
14´ëÇÏ 8:6 and Baalath, as well as all Solomon's storage towns, and all the towns for his chariots, the towns for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build, in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
14´ëÇÏ 8:7 All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
14´ëÇÏ 8:8 from their descendants who were still left in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed--these Solomon conscripted for forced labor, as is still the case today.
14´ëÇÏ 8:9 But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariotry and cavalry.
14´ëÇÏ 8:10 These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred fifty of them, who exercised authority over the people.
14´ëÇÏ 8:11 Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, "My wife shall not live in the house of King David of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy."
14´ëÇÏ 8:12 Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the vestibule,
14´ëÇÏ 8:13 as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual festivals--the festival of unleavened bread, the festival of weeks, and the festival of booths.
14´ëÇÏ 8:14 According to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry alongside the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the several gates; for so David the man of God had commanded.
14´ëÇÏ 8:15 They did not turn away from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites regarding anything at all, or regarding the treasuries.
14´ëÇÏ 8:16 Thus all the work of Solomon was accomplished from the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until the house of the LORD was finished completely.
14´ëÇÏ 8:17 Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.
14´ëÇÏ 8:18 Huram sent him, in the care of his servants, ships and servants familiar with the sea. They went to Ophir, together with the servants of Solomon, and imported from there four hundred fifty talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she discussed with him all that was on her mind.
14´ëÇÏ 9:2 Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.
14´ëÇÏ 9:3 When the queen of Sheba had observed the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
14´ëÇÏ 9:4 the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his valets, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit left in her.
14´ëÇÏ 9:5 So she said to the king, "The report was true that I heard in my own land of your accomplishments and of your wisdom,
14´ëÇÏ 9:6 but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes saw it. Not even half of the greatness of your wisdom had been told to me; you far surpass the report that I had heard.
14´ëÇÏ 9:7 Happy are your people! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend you and hear your wisdom!
14´ëÇÏ 9:8 Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness."
14´ëÇÏ 9:9 Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones: there were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:10 Moreover the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones.
14´ëÇÏ 9:11 From the algum wood, the king made steps for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers; there never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 9:12 Meanwhile King Solomon granted the queen of Sheba every desire that she expressed, well beyond what she had brought to the king. Then she returned to her own land, with her servants.
14´ëÇÏ 9:13 The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
14´ëÇÏ 9:14 besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:15 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each large shield.
14´ëÇÏ 9:16 He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:17 The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold.
14´ëÇÏ 9:18 The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,
14´ëÇÏ 9:19 while twelve lions were standing, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:20 All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:21 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
14´ëÇÏ 9:22 Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:23 All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
14´ëÇÏ 9:24 Every one of them brought a present, objects of silver and gold, garments, weaponry, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
14´ëÇÏ 9:25 Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 9:26 He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 9:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
14´ëÇÏ 9:28 Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
14´ëÇÏ 9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of the prophet Nathan, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of the seer Iddo concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
14´ëÇÏ 9:30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
14´ëÇÏ 9:31 Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
14´ëÇÏ 10:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 10:3 They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
14´ëÇÏ 10:4 "Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke that he placed on us, and we will serve you."
14´ëÇÏ 10:5 He said to them, "Come to me again in three days." So the people went away.
14´ëÇÏ 10:6 Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the older men who had attended his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?"
14´ëÇÏ 10:7 They answered him, "If you will be kind to this people and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
14´ëÇÏ 10:8 But he rejected the advice that the older men gave him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and now attended him.
14´ëÇÏ 10:9 He said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"
14´ëÇÏ 10:10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus should you speak to the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must lighten it for us'; tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
14´ëÇÏ 10:11 Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
14´ëÇÏ 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had said, "Come to me again the third day."
14´ëÇÏ 10:13 The king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men;
14´ëÇÏ 10:14 he spoke to them in accordance with the advice of the young men, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
14´ëÇÏ 10:15 So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of affairs brought about by God so that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
14´ëÇÏ 10:16 When all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David." So all Israel departed to their tents.
14´ëÇÏ 10:17 But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who were living in the cities of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 10:18 When King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, the people of Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurriedly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 10:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 11:1 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled one hundred eighty thousand chosen troops of the house of Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
14´ëÇÏ 11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
14´ëÇÏ 11:3 Say to King Rehoboam of Judah, son of Solomon, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
14´ëÇÏ 11:4 "Thus says the LORD: You shall not go up or fight against your kindred. Let everyone return home, for this thing is from me." So they heeded the word of the LORD and turned back from the expedition against Jeroboam.
14´ëÇÏ 11:5 Rehoboam resided in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 11:6 He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
14´ëÇÏ 11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
14´ëÇÏ 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
14´ëÇÏ 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
14´ëÇÏ 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin.
14´ëÇÏ 11:11 He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.
14´ëÇÏ 11:12 He also put large shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
14´ëÇÏ 11:13 The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all their territories.
14´ëÇÏ 11:14 The Levites had left their common lands and their holdings and had come to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had prevented them from serving as priests of the LORD,
14´ëÇÏ 11:15 and had appointed his own priests for the high places, and for the goat-demons, and for the calves that he had made.
14´ëÇÏ 11:16 Those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 11:17 They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 11:18 Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath daughter of Jerimoth son of David, and of Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse.
14´ëÇÏ 11:19 She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
14´ëÇÏ 11:20 After her he took Maacah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
14´ëÇÏ 11:21 Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his other wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).
14´ëÇÏ 11:22 Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.
14´ëÇÏ 11:23 He dealt wisely, and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities; he gave them abundant provisions, and found many wives for them.
14´ëÇÏ 12:1 When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he grew strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, he and all Israel with him.
14´ëÇÏ 12:2 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
14´ëÇÏ 12:3 with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand cavalry. A countless army came with him from Egypt--Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
14´ëÇÏ 12:4 He took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 12:5 Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the officers of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, "Thus says the LORD: You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak."
14´ëÇÏ 12:6 Then the officers of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is in the right."
14´ëÇÏ 12:7 When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying: "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
14´ëÇÏ 12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants, so that they may know the difference between serving me and serving the kingdoms of other lands."
14´ëÇÏ 12:9 So King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made;
14´ëÇÏ 12:10 but King Rehoboam made in place of them shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
14´ëÇÏ 12:11 Whenever the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard would come along bearing them, and would then bring them back to the guardroom.
14´ëÇÏ 12:12 Because he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to destroy them completely; moreover, conditions were good in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 12:13 So King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
14´ëÇÏ 12:14 He did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of the prophet Shemaiah and of the seer Iddo, recorded by genealogy? There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
14´ëÇÏ 12:16 Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 13:1 In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 13:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
14´ëÇÏ 13:3 Abijah engaged in battle, having an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand picked men; and Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with eight hundred thousand picked mighty warriors.
14´ëÇÏ 13:4 Then Abijah stood on the slope of Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
14´ëÇÏ 13:5 Do you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
14´ëÇÏ 13:6 Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord;
14´ëÇÏ 13:7 and certain worthless scoundrels gathered around him and defied Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.
14´ëÇÏ 13:8 "And now you think that you can withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made as gods for you.
14´ëÇÏ 13:9 Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to be consecrated with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are no gods.
14´ëÇÏ 13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not abandoned him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are descendants of Aaron, and Levites for their service.
14´ëÇÏ 13:11 They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and fragrant incense, set out the rows of bread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand so that its lamps may burn every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have abandoned him.
14´ëÇÏ 13:12 See, God is with us at our head, and his priests have their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O Israelites, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors; for you cannot succeed."
14´ëÇÏ 13:13 Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come on them from behind; thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
14´ëÇÏ 13:14 When Judah turned, the battle was in front of them and behind them. They cried out to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.
14´ëÇÏ 13:15 Then the people of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the people of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 13:16 The Israelites fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hands.
14´ëÇÏ 13:17 Abijah and his army defeated them with great slaughter; five hundred thousand picked men of Israel fell slain.
14´ëÇÏ 13:18 Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the people of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 13:19 Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages.
14´ëÇÏ 13:20 Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah; the LORD struck him down, and he died.
14´ëÇÏ 13:21 But Abijah grew strong. He took fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
14´ëÇÏ 13:22 The rest of the acts of Abijah, his behavior and his deeds, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
14´ëÇÏ 14:1 So Abijah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. His son Asa succeeded him. In his days the land had rest for ten years.
14´ëÇÏ 14:2 Asa did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 14:3 He took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, hewed down the sacred poles,
14´ëÇÏ 14:4 and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to keep the law and the commandment.
14´ëÇÏ 14:5 He also removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.
14´ëÇÏ 14:6 He built fortified cities in Judah while the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the LORD gave him peace.
14´ëÇÏ 14:7 He said to Judah, "Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars; the land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.
14´ëÇÏ 14:8 Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand troops from Benjamin who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty warriors.
14´ëÇÏ 14:9 Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah.
14´ëÇÏ 14:10 Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
14´ëÇÏ 14:11 Asa cried to the LORD his God, "O LORD, there is no difference for you between helping the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let no mortal prevail against you."
14´ëÇÏ 14:12 So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
14´ëÇÏ 14:13 Asa and the army with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until no one remained alive; for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The people of Judah carried away a great quantity of booty.
14´ëÇÏ 14:14 They defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD was on them. They plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them.
14´ëÇÏ 14:15 They also attacked the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away sheep and goats in abundance, and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 15:1 The spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.
14´ëÇÏ 15:2 He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you, while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you.
14´ëÇÏ 15:3 For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;
14´ëÇÏ 15:4 but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
14´ëÇÏ 15:5 In those times it was not safe for anyone to go or come, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.
14´ëÇÏ 15:6 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress.
14´ëÇÏ 15:7 But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded."
14´ëÇÏ 15:8 When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 15:9 He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing as aliens with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
14´ëÇÏ 15:10 They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
14´ëÇÏ 15:11 They sacrificed to the LORD on that day, from the booty that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
14´ëÇÏ 15:12 They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and with all their soul.
14´ëÇÏ 15:13 Whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
14´ëÇÏ 15:14 They took an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns.
14´ëÇÏ 15:15 All Judah rejoiced over the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.
14´ëÇÏ 15:16 King Asa even removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the Wadi Kidron.
14´ëÇÏ 15:17 But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was true all his days.
14´ëÇÏ 15:18 He brought into the house of God the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts--silver, gold, and utensils.
14´ëÇÏ 15:19 And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
14´ëÇÏ 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, King Baasha of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming into the territory of King Asa of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 16:2 Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king's house, and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Aram, who resided in Damascus, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 16:3 "Let there be an alliance between me and you, like that between my father and your father; I am sending to you silver and gold; go, break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me."
14´ëÇÏ 16:4 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.
14´ëÇÏ 16:5 When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.
14´ëÇÏ 16:6 Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built up Geba and Mizpah.
14´ëÇÏ 16:7 At that time the seer Hanani came to King Asa of Judah, and said to him, "Because you relied on the king of Aram, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped you.
14´ëÇÏ 16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with exceedingly many chariots and cavalry? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand.
14´ëÇÏ 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the entire earth, to strengthen those whose heart is true to him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars."
14´ëÇÏ 16:10 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the stocks, in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties on some of the people at the same time.
14´ëÇÏ 16:11 The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe; yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians.
14´ëÇÏ 16:13 Then Asa slept with his ancestors, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
14´ëÇÏ 16:14 They buried him in the tomb that he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art; and they made a very great fire in his honor.
14´ëÇÏ 17:1 His son Jehoshaphat succeeded him, and strengthened himself against Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 17:2 He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had taken.
14´ëÇÏ 17:3 The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father; he did not seek the Baals,
14´ëÇÏ 17:4 but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the ways of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 17:5 Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor.
14´ëÇÏ 17:6 His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD; and furthermore he removed the high places and the sacred poles from Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 17:7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 17:8 With them were the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
14´ëÇÏ 17:9 They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the LORD with them; they went around through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
14´ëÇÏ 17:10 The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands around Judah, and they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
14´ëÇÏ 17:11 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; and the Arabs also brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
14´ëÇÏ 17:12 Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 17:13 He carried out great works in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 17:14 This was the muster of them by ancestral houses: Of Judah, the commanders of the thousands: Adnah the commander, with three hundred thousand mighty warriors,
14´ëÇÏ 17:15 and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with two hundred eighty thousand,
14´ëÇÏ 17:16 and next to him Amasiah son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with two hundred thousand mighty warriors.
14´ëÇÏ 17:17 Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty warrior, with two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield,
14´ëÇÏ 17:18 and next to him Jehozabad with one hundred eighty thousand armed for war.
14´ëÇÏ 17:19 These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.
14´ëÇÏ 18:2 After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
14´ëÇÏ 18:3 King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" He answered him, "I am with you, my people are your people. We will be with you in the war."
14´ëÇÏ 18:4 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 18:5 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred of them, and said to them, "Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?" They said, "Go up; for God will give it into the hand of the king."
14´ëÇÏ 18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no other prophet of the LORD here of whom we may inquire?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:7 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one other by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster." Jehoshaphat said, "Let the king not say such a thing."
14´ëÇÏ 18:8 Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah."
14´ëÇÏ 18:9 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes; and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
14´ëÇÏ 18:10 Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, "Thus says the LORD: With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are destroyed."
14´ëÇÏ 18:11 All the prophets were prophesying the same and saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
14´ëÇÏ 18:12 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
14´ëÇÏ 18:13 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak."
14´ëÇÏ 18:14 When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" He answered, "Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand."
14´ëÇÏ 18:15 But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:16 Then Micaiah said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd; and the LORD said, 'These have no master; let each one go home in peace.'"
14´ëÇÏ 18:17 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy anything favorable about me, but only disaster?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:18 Then Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing to the right and to the left of him.
14´ëÇÏ 18:19 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice King Ahab of Israel, so that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' Then one said one thing, and another said another,
14´ëÇÏ 18:20 until a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I will entice him.' The LORD asked him, 'How?'
14´ëÇÏ 18:21 He replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then the LORD said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do it.'
14´ëÇÏ 18:22 So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; the LORD has decreed disaster for you."
14´ëÇÏ 18:23 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up to Micaiah, slapped him on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:24 Micaiah replied, "You will find out on that day when you go in to hide in an inner chamber."
14´ëÇÏ 18:25 The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son;
14´ëÇÏ 18:26 and say, 'Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him on reduced rations of bread and water until I return in peace.'"
14´ëÇÏ 18:27 Micaiah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, you peoples, all of you!"
14´ëÇÏ 18:28 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
14´ëÇÏ 18:29 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
14´ëÇÏ 18:30 Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, "Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel."
14´ëÇÏ 18:31 When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,
14´ëÇÏ 18:32 for when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
14´ëÇÏ 18:33 But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; so he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."
14´ëÇÏ 18:34 The battle grew hot that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening; then at sunset he died.
14´ëÇÏ 19:1 King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 19:2 Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, wrath has gone out against you from the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 19:3 Nevertheless, some good is found in you, for you destroyed the sacred poles out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God."
14´ëÇÏ 19:4 Jehoshaphat resided at Jerusalem; then he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 19:5 He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
14´ëÇÏ 19:6 and said to the judges, "Consider what you are doing, for you judge not on behalf of human beings but on the LORD's behalf; he is with you in giving judgment.
14´ëÇÏ 19:7 Now, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take care what you do, for there is no perversion of justice with the LORD our God, or partiality, or taking of bribes."
14´ëÇÏ 19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel, to give judgment for the LORD and to decide disputed cases. They had their seat at Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 19:9 He charged them: "This is how you shall act: in the fear of the LORD, in faithfulness, and with your whole heart;
14´ëÇÏ 19:10 whenever a case comes to you from your kindred who live in their cities, concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or ordinances, then you shall instruct them, so that they may not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath may not come on you and your kindred. Do so, and you will not incur guilt.
14´ëÇÏ 19:11 See, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters; and the Levites will serve you as officers. Deal courageously, and may the LORD be with the good!"
14´ëÇÏ 20:1 After this the Moabites and Ammonites, and with them some of the Meunites, came against Jehoshaphat for battle.
14´ëÇÏ 20:2 Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, "A great multitude is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the sea; already they are at Hazazon-tamar" (that is, En-gedi).
14´ëÇÏ 20:3 Jehoshaphat was afraid; he set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 20:4 Judah assembled to seek help from the LORD; from all the towns of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:5 Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
14´ëÇÏ 20:6 and said, "O LORD, God of our ancestors, are you not God in heaven? Do you not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? In your hand are power and might, so that no one is able to withstand you.
14´ëÇÏ 20:7 Did you not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham?
14´ëÇÏ 20:8 They have lived in it, and in it have built you a sanctuary for your name, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 20:9 'If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before you, for your name is in this house, and cry to you in our distress, and you will hear and save.'
14´ëÇÏ 20:10 See now, the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy--
14´ëÇÏ 20:11 they reward us by coming to drive us out of your possession that you have given us to inherit.
14´ëÇÏ 20:12 O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them? For we are powerless against this great multitude that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."
14´ëÇÏ 20:13 Meanwhile all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
14´ëÇÏ 20:14 Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 20:15 He said, "Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the LORD to you: 'Do not fear or be dismayed at this great multitude; for the battle is not yours but God's.
14´ëÇÏ 20:16 Tomorrow go down against them; they will come up by the ascent of Ziz; you will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:17 This battle is not for you to fight; take your position, stand still, and see the victory of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, and the LORD will be with you."
14´ëÇÏ 20:18 Then Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:19 And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
14´ëÇÏ 20:20 They rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the LORD your God and you will be established; believe his prophets."
14´ëÇÏ 20:21 When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the LORD and praise him in holy splendor, as they went before the army, saying, "Give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever."
14´ëÇÏ 20:22 As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed.
14´ëÇÏ 20:23 For the Ammonites and Moab attacked the inhabitants of Mount Seir, destroying them utterly; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.
14´ëÇÏ 20:24 When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; they were corpses lying on the ground; no one had escaped.
14´ëÇÏ 20:25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the booty from them, they found livestock in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which they took for themselves until they could carry no more. They spent three days taking the booty, because of its abundance.
14´ëÇÏ 20:26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD; therefore that place has been called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 20:27 Then all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had enabled them to rejoice over their enemies.
14´ëÇÏ 20:28 They came to Jerusalem, with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:29 The fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:30 And the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.
14´ëÇÏ 20:31 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
14´ëÇÏ 20:32 He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:33 Yet the high places were not removed; the people had not yet set their hearts upon the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:35 After this King Jehoshaphat of Judah joined with King Ahaziah of Israel, who did wickedly.
14´ëÇÏ 20:36 He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish; they built the ships in Ezion-geber.
14´ëÇÏ 20:37 Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.
14´ëÇÏ 21:1 Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David; his son Jehoram succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 21:2 He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 21:3 Their father gave them many gifts, of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, together with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
14´ëÇÏ 21:4 When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he put all his brothers to the sword, and also some of the officials of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 21:5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 21:6 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 21:7 Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant that he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his descendants forever.
14´ëÇÏ 21:8 In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own.
14´ëÇÏ 21:9 Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. He set out by night and attacked the Edomites, who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders.
14´ëÇÏ 21:10 So Edom has been in revolt against the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 21:11 Moreover he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, and made Judah go astray.
14´ëÇÏ 21:12 A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah, saying: "Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or in the ways of King Asa of Judah,
14´ëÇÏ 21:13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, as the house of Ahab led Israel into unfaithfulness, and because you also have killed your brothers, members of your father's house, who were better than yourself,
14´ëÇÏ 21:14 see, the LORD will bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,
14´ëÇÏ 21:15 and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out, day after day, because of the disease."
14´ëÇÏ 21:16 The LORD aroused against Jehoram the anger of the Philistines and of the Arabs who are near the Ethiopians.
14´ëÇÏ 21:17 They came up against Judah, invaded it, and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king's house, along with his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son.
14´ëÇÏ 21:18 After all this the LORD struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
14´ëÇÏ 21:19 In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 21:20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. He departed with no one's regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14´ëÇÏ 22:1 The inhabitants of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king as his successor; for the troops who came with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram reigned as king of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 22:2 Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.
14´ëÇÏ 22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly.
14´ëÇÏ 22:4 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done; for after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his ruin.
14´ëÇÏ 22:5 He even followed their advice, and went with Jehoram son of King Ahab of Israel to make war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram,
14´ëÇÏ 22:6 and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah, when he fought King Hazael of Aram. And Ahaziah son of King Jehoram of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
14´ëÇÏ 22:7 But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
14´ëÇÏ 22:8 When Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them.
14´ëÇÏ 22:9 He searched for Ahaziah, who was captured while hiding in Samaria and was brought to Jehu, and put to death. They buried him, for they said, "He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom.
14´ëÇÏ 22:10 Now when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she set about to destroy all the royal family of the house of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the king's daughter, took Joash son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's children who were about to be killed; she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada--because she was a sister of Ahaziah--hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not kill him;
14´ëÇÏ 22:12 he remained with them six years, hidden in the house of God, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
14´ëÇÏ 23:1 But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage, and entered into a compact with the commanders of the hundreds, Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
14´ëÇÏ 23:2 They went around through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the towns of Judah, and the heads of families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 23:3 Then the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. Jehoiada said to them, "Here is the king's son! Let him reign, as the LORD promised concerning the sons of David.
14´ëÇÏ 23:4 This is what you are to do: one third of you, priests and Levites, who come on duty on the sabbath, shall be gatekeepers,
14´ëÇÏ 23:5 one third shall be at the king's house, and one third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 23:6 Do not let anyone enter the house of the LORD except the priests and ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy, but all the other people shall observe the instructions of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 23:7 The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house shall be killed. Stay with the king in his comings and goings."
14´ëÇÏ 23:8 The Levites and all Judah did according to all that the priest Jehoiada commanded; each brought his men, who were to come on duty on the sabbath, with those who were to go off duty on the sabbath; for the priest Jehoiada did not dismiss the divisions.
14´ëÇÏ 23:9 The priest Jehoiada delivered to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of God;
14´ëÇÏ 23:10 and he set all the people as a guard for the king, everyone with weapon in hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house.
14´ëÇÏ 23:11 Then he brought out the king's son, put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they shouted, "Long live the king!"
14´ëÇÏ 23:12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the LORD to the people;
14´ëÇÏ 23:13 and when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration. Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
14´ëÇÏ 23:14 Then the priest Jehoiada brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; anyone who follows her is to be put to the sword." For the priest said, "Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 23:15 So they laid hands on her; she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house, and there they put her to death.
14´ëÇÏ 23:16 Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the LORD's people.
14´ëÇÏ 23:17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
14´ëÇÏ 23:18 Jehoiada assigned the care of the house of the LORD to the levitical priests whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.
14´ëÇÏ 23:19 He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean.
14´ëÇÏ 23:20 And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the upper gate to the king's house. They set the king on the royal throne.
14´ëÇÏ 23:21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been killed with the sword.
14´ëÇÏ 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
14´ëÇÏ 24:2 Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of the priest Jehoiada.
14´ëÇÏ 24:3 Jehoiada got two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
14´ëÇÏ 24:4 Some time afterward Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:5 He assembled the priests and the Levites and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and gather money from all Israel to repair the house of your God, year by year; and see that you act quickly." But the Levites did not act quickly.
14´ëÇÏ 24:6 So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, "Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD, on the congregation of Israel for the tent of the covenant?"
14´ëÇÏ 24:7 For the children of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had even used all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
14´ëÇÏ 24:8 So the king gave command, and they made a chest, and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:9 A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
14´ëÇÏ 24:10 All the leaders and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until it was full.
14´ëÇÏ 24:11 Whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was a large amount of money in it, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. So they did day after day, and collected money in abundance.
14´ëÇÏ 24:12 The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the LORD, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:13 So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward at their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it.
14´ëÇÏ 24:14 When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the LORD, utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings, and ladles, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD regularly all the days of Jehoiada.
14´ëÇÏ 24:15 But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died; he was one hundred thirty years old at his death.
14´ëÇÏ 24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and for God and his house.
14´ëÇÏ 24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and did obeisance to the king; then the king listened to them.
14´ëÇÏ 24:18 They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and served the sacred poles and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
14´ëÇÏ 24:19 Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the LORD; they testified against them, but they would not listen.
14´ëÇÏ 24:20 Then the spirit of God took possession of Zechariah son of the priest Jehoiada; he stood above the people and said to them, "Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you."
14´ëÇÏ 24:21 But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:22 King Joash did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him, but killed his son. As he was dying, he said, "May the LORD see and avenge!"
14´ëÇÏ 24:23 At the end of the year the army of Aram came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the officials of the people from among them, and sent all the booty they took to the king of Damascus.
14´ëÇÏ 24:24 Although the army of Aram had come with few men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army, because they had abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors. Thus they executed judgment on Joash.
14´ëÇÏ 24:25 When they had withdrawn, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of the priest Jehoiada, and they killed him on his bed. So he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
14´ëÇÏ 24:26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonite, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabite.
14´ëÇÏ 24:27 Accounts of his sons, and of the many oracles against him, and of the rebuilding of the house of God are written in the Commentary on the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 25:1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 25:2 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not with a true heart.
14´ëÇÏ 25:3 As soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had murdered his father the king.
14´ëÇÏ 25:4 But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the law, in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "The parents shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the parents; but all shall be put to death for their own sins."
14´ëÇÏ 25:5 Amaziah assembled the people of Judah, and set them by ancestral houses under commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were three hundred thousand picked troops fit for war, able to handle spear and shield.
14´ëÇÏ 25:6 He also hired one hundred thousand mighty warriors from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
14´ëÇÏ 25:7 But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel--all these Ephraimites.
14´ëÇÏ 25:8 Rather, go by yourself and act; be strong in battle, or God will fling you down before the enemy; for God has power to help or to overthrow."
14´ëÇÏ 25:9 Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answered, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this."
14´ëÇÏ 25:10 Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim, letting them go home again. But they became very angry with Judah, and returned home in fierce anger.
14´ëÇÏ 25:11 Amaziah took courage, and led out his people; he went to the Valley of Salt, and struck down ten thousand men of Seir.
14´ëÇÏ 25:12 The people of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, took them to the top of Sela, and threw them down from the top of Sela, so that all of them were dashed to pieces.
14´ëÇÏ 25:13 But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon; they killed three thousand people in them, and took much booty.
14´ëÇÏ 25:14 Now after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his gods, and worshiped them, making offerings to them.
14´ëÇÏ 25:15 The LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you resorted to a people's gods who could not deliver their own people from your hand?"
14´ëÇÏ 25:16 But as he was speaking the king said to him, "Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?" So the prophet stopped, but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice."
14´ëÇÏ 25:17 Then King Amaziah of Judah took counsel and sent to King Joash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
14´ëÇÏ 25:18 King Joash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, "A thorn bush on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife'; but a wild animal of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorn bush.
14´ëÇÏ 25:19 You say, 'See, I have defeated Edom,' and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. Now stay at home; why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"
14´ëÇÏ 25:20 But Amaziah would not listen--it was God's doing, in order to hand them over, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
14´ëÇÏ 25:21 So King Joash of Israel went up; he and King Amaziah of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 25:22 Judah was defeated by Israel; everyone fled home.
14´ëÇÏ 25:23 King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh; he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 25:24 He seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, and Obed-edom with them; he seized also the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages; then he returned to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 25:25 King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of King Joash son of Jehoahaz of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 25:26 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
14´ëÇÏ 25:27 From the time that Amaziah turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.
14´ëÇÏ 25:28 They brought him back on horses; he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David.
14´ëÇÏ 26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king to succeed his father Amaziah.
14´ëÇÏ 26:2 He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 26:3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 26:4 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
14´ëÇÏ 26:5 He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.
14´ëÇÏ 26:6 He went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
14´ëÇÏ 26:7 God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who lived in Gur-baal, and against the Meunites.
14´ëÇÏ 26:8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
14´ëÇÏ 26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and fortified them.
14´ëÇÏ 26:10 He built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
14´ëÇÏ 26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by the secretary Jeiel and the officer Maaseiah, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders.
14´ëÇÏ 26:12 The whole number of the heads of ancestral houses of mighty warriors was two thousand six hundred.
14´ëÇÏ 26:13 Under their command was an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
14´ëÇÏ 26:14 Uzziah provided for all the army the shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
14´ëÇÏ 26:15 In Jerusalem he set up machines, invented by skilled workers, on the towers and the corners for shooting arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong.
14´ëÇÏ 26:16 But when he had become strong he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was false to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to make offering on the altar of incense.
14´ëÇÏ 26:17 But the priest Azariah went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor;
14´ëÇÏ 26:18 they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to make offering to the LORD, but for the priests the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated to make offering. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God."
14´ëÇÏ 26:19 Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to make offering, and when he became angry with the priests a leprous disease broke out on his forehead, in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense.
14´ëÇÏ 26:20 When the chief priest Azariah, and all the priests, looked at him, he was leprous in his forehead. They hurried him out, and he himself hurried to get out, because the LORD had struck him.
14´ëÇÏ 26:21 King Uzziah was leprous to the day of his death, and being leprous lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. His son Jotham was in charge of the palace of the king, governing the people of the land.
14´ëÇÏ 26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz wrote.
14´ëÇÏ 26:23 Uzziah slept with his ancestors; they buried him near his ancestors in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is leprous." His son Jotham succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 27:1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
14´ëÇÏ 27:2 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD just as his father Uzziah had done--only he did not invade the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices.
14´ëÇÏ 27:3 He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and did extensive building on the wall of Ophel.
14´ëÇÏ 27:4 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills.
14´ëÇÏ 27:5 He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. The Ammonites gave him that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years.
14´ëÇÏ 27:6 So Jotham became strong because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 27:8 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 27:9 Jotham slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David; and his son Ahaz succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his ancestor David had done,
14´ëÇÏ 28:2 but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made cast images for the Baals;
14´ëÇÏ 28:3 and he made offerings in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his sons pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:4 He sacrificed and made offerings on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
14´ëÇÏ 28:5 Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with great slaughter.
14´ëÇÏ 28:6 Pekah son of Remaliah killed one hundred twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all of them valiant warriors, because they had abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 28:7 And Zichri, a mighty warrior of Ephraim, killed the king's son Maaseiah, Azrikam the commander of the palace, and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.
14´ëÇÏ 28:8 The people of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kin, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much booty from them and brought the booty to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 28:10 Now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. But what have you except sins against the LORD your God?
14´ëÇÏ 28:11 Now hear me, and send back the captives whom you have taken from your kindred, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."
14´ëÇÏ 28:12 Moreover, certain chiefs of the Ephraimites, Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war,
14´ëÇÏ 28:13 and said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring on us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."
14´ëÇÏ 28:14 So the warriors left the captives and the booty before the officials and all the assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 28:15 Then those who were mentioned by name got up and took the captives, and with the booty they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kindred at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 28:16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
14´ëÇÏ 28:17 For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried away captives.
14´ëÇÏ 28:18 And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they settled there.
14´ëÇÏ 28:19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of King Ahaz of Israel, for he had behaved without restraint in Judah and had been faithless to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 28:20 So King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria came against him, and oppressed him instead of strengthening him.
14´ëÇÏ 28:21 For Ahaz plundered the house of the LORD and the houses of the king and of the officials, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria; but it did not help him.
14´ëÇÏ 28:22 In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD--this same King Ahaz.
14´ëÇÏ 28:23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had defeated him, and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:24 Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, and cut in pieces the utensils of the house of God. He shut up the doors of the house of the LORD and made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 28:25 In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 28:26 Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:27 Ahaz slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
14´ëÇÏ 29:2 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his ancestor David had done.
14´ëÇÏ 29:3 In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.
14´ëÇÏ 29:4 He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east.
14´ëÇÏ 29:5 He said to them, "Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and carry out the filth from the holy place.
14´ëÇÏ 29:6 For our ancestors have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God; they have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the dwelling of the LORD, and turned their backs.
14´ëÇÏ 29:7 They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps, and have not offered incense or made burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:8 Therefore the wrath of the LORD came upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
14´ëÇÏ 29:9 Our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
14´ëÇÏ 29:10 Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
14´ëÇÏ 29:11 My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence to minister to him, and to be his ministers and make offerings to him."
14´ëÇÏ 29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;
14´ëÇÏ 29:13 and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14´ëÇÏ 29:14 and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:15 They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:16 The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the unclean things that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD; and the Levites took them and carried them out to the Wadi Kidron.
14´ëÇÏ 29:17 They began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD; then for eight days they sanctified the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.
14´ëÇÏ 29:18 Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, "We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils.
14´ëÇÏ 29:19 All the utensils that King Ahaz repudiated during his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and sanctified; see, they are in front of the altar of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 29:20 Then King Hezekiah rose early, assembled the officials of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded the priests the descendants of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and dashed it against the altar; they slaughtered the rams and their blood was dashed against the altar; they also slaughtered the lambs and their blood was dashed against the altar.
14´ëÇÏ 29:23 Then the male goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly; they laid their hands on them,
14´ëÇÏ 29:24 and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood at the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:25 He stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king's seer and of the prophet Nathan, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets.
14´ëÇÏ 29:26 The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
14´ëÇÏ 29:27 Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of King David of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:28 The whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
14´ëÇÏ 29:29 When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.
14´ëÇÏ 29:30 King Hezekiah and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of the seer Asaph. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.
14´ëÇÏ 29:31 Then Hezekiah said, "You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD; come near, bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD." The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings; and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
14´ëÇÏ 29:32 The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:33 The consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
14´ëÇÏ 29:34 But the priests were too few and could not skin all the burnt offerings, so, until other priests had sanctified themselves, their kindred, the Levites, helped them until the work was finished--for the Levites were more conscientious than the priests in sanctifying themselves.
14´ëÇÏ 29:35 Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of the offerings of well-being, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored.
14´ëÇÏ 29:36 And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for the people; for the thing had come about suddenly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:1 Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 30:2 For the king and his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month
14´ëÇÏ 30:3 (for they could not keep it at its proper time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem).
14´ëÇÏ 30:4 The plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:5 So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the LORD the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed.
14´ëÇÏ 30:6 So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials, as the king had commanded, saying, "O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
14´ëÇÏ 30:7 Do not be like your ancestors and your kindred, who were faithless to the LORD God of their ancestors, so that he made them a desolation, as you see.
14´ëÇÏ 30:8 Do not now be stiff-necked as your ancestors were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
14´ëÇÏ 30:9 For as you return to the LORD, your kindred and your children will find compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him."
14´ëÇÏ 30:10 So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
14´ëÇÏ 30:11 Only a few from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 30:12 The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the officials commanded by the word of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:13 Many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the festival of unleavened bread in the second month, a very large assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:14 They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for offering incense they took away and threw into the Wadi Kidron.
14´ëÇÏ 30:15 They slaughtered the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:16 They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests dashed the blood that they received from the hands of the Levites.
14´ëÇÏ 30:17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to slaughter the passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to make it holy to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:18 For a multitude of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon all
14´ëÇÏ 30:19 who set their hearts to seek God, the LORD the God of their ancestors, even though not in accordance with the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."
14´ëÇÏ 30:20 The LORD heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.
14´ëÇÏ 30:21 The people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the festival of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, accompanied by loud instruments for the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:22 Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So the people ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing offerings of well-being and giving thanks to the LORD the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 30:23 Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the festival for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness.
14´ëÇÏ 30:24 For King Hezekiah of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the officials gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. The priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.
14´ëÇÏ 30:25 The whole assembly of Judah, the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the resident aliens who came out of the land of Israel, and the resident aliens who lived in Judah, rejoiced.
14´ëÇÏ 30:26 There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon son of King David of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 30:27 Then the priests and the Levites stood up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; their prayer came to his holy dwelling in heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke down the pillars, hewed down the sacred poles, and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, all to their individual properties.
14´ëÇÏ 31:2 Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, everyone according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and offerings of well-being, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise.
14´ëÇÏ 31:3 The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 31:4 He commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, so that they might devote themselves to the law of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 31:5 As soon as the word spread, the people of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
14´ëÇÏ 31:6 The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that had been consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps.
14´ëÇÏ 31:7 In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
14´ëÇÏ 31:8 When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 31:9 Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
14´ëÇÏ 31:10 The chief priest Azariah, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, "Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and have plenty to spare; for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this great supply left over."
14´ëÇÏ 31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare store-chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them.
14´ëÇÏ 31:12 Faithfully they brought in the contributions, the tithes and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with his brother Shimei as second;
14´ëÇÏ 31:13 while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by the appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 31:14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the LORD and the most holy offerings.
14´ëÇÏ 31:15 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their kindred, old and young alike, by divisions,
14´ëÇÏ 31:16 except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upwards, all who entered the house of the LORD as the duty of each day required, for their service according to their offices, by their divisions.
14´ëÇÏ 31:17 The enrollment of the priests was according to their ancestral houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upwards was according to their offices, by their divisions.
14´ëÇÏ 31:18 The priests were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole multitude; for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy.
14´ëÇÏ 31:19 And for the descendants of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their towns, town by town, the people designated by name were to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled.
14´ëÇÏ 31:20 Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah; he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 31:21 And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God, and in accordance with the law and the commandments, to seek his God, he did with all his heart; and he prospered.
14´ëÇÏ 32:1 After these things and these acts of faithfulness, King Sennacherib of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 32:2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem,
14´ëÇÏ 32:3 he planned with his officers and his warriors to stop the flow of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
14´ëÇÏ 32:4 A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and the wadi that flowed through the land, saying, "Why should the Assyrian kings come and find water in abundance?"
14´ëÇÏ 32:5 Hezekiah set to work resolutely and built up the entire wall that was broken down, and raised towers on it, and outside it he built another wall; he also strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
14´ëÇÏ 32:6 He appointed combat commanders over the people, and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 32:7 "Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is one greater with us than with him.
14´ëÇÏ 32:8 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles." The people were encouraged by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:9 After this, while King Sennacherib of Assyria was at Lachish with all his forces, he sent his servants to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all the people of Judah that were in Jerusalem, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 32:10 "Thus says King Sennacherib of Assyria: On what are you relying, that you undergo the siege of Jerusalem?
14´ëÇÏ 32:11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you, handing you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, 'The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria'?
14´ëÇÏ 32:12 Was it not this same Hezekiah who took away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, 'Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it you shall make your offerings'?
14´ëÇÏ 32:13 Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to save their lands out of my hand?
14´ëÇÏ 32:14 Who among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors utterly destroyed was able to save his people from my hand, that your God should be able to save you from my hand?
14´ëÇÏ 32:15 Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand or from the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God save you out of my hand!"
14´ëÇÏ 32:16 His servants said still more against the Lord GOD and against his servant Hezekiah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:17 He also wrote letters to throw contempt on the LORD the God of Israel and to speak against him, saying, "Just as the gods of the nations in other lands did not rescue their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."
14´ëÇÏ 32:18 They shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city.
14´ëÇÏ 32:19 They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as if he were like the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of human hands.
14´ëÇÏ 32:20 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed because of this and cried to heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 32:21 And the LORD sent an angel who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in disgrace to his own land. When he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword.
14´ëÇÏ 32:22 So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies; he gave them rest on every side.
14´ëÇÏ 32:23 Many brought gifts to the LORD in Jerusalem and precious things to King Hezekiah of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.
14´ëÇÏ 32:24 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign.
14´ëÇÏ 32:25 But Hezekiah did not respond according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 32:26 Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:27 Hezekiah had very great riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly objects;
14´ëÇÏ 32:28 storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.
14´ëÇÏ 32:29 He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very great possessions.
14´ëÇÏ 32:30 This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
14´ëÇÏ 32:31 So also in the matter of the envoys of the officials of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.
14´ëÇÏ 32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 32:33 Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him on the ascent to the tombs of the descendants of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. His son Manasseh succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 33:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:3 For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had pulled down, and erected altars to the Baals, made sacred poles, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
14´ëÇÏ 33:4 He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem shall my name be forever."
14´ëÇÏ 33:5 He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 33:6 He made his son pass through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, practiced soothsaying and augury and sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
14´ëÇÏ 33:7 The carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;
14´ëÇÏ 33:8 I will never again remove the feet of Israel from the land that I appointed for your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses."
14´ëÇÏ 33:9 Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the people of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:10 The LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they gave no heed.
14´ëÇÏ 33:11 Therefore the LORD brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh captive in manacles, bound him with fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 33:12 While he was in distress he entreated the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 33:13 He prayed to him, and God received his entreaty, heard his plea, and restored him again to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD indeed was God.
14´ëÇÏ 33:14 Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, reaching the entrance at the Fish Gate; he carried it around Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. He also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 33:15 He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them out of the city.
14´ëÇÏ 33:16 He also restored the altar of the LORD and offered on it sacrifices of well-being and of thanksgiving; and he commanded Judah to serve the LORD the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:17 The people, however, still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
14´ëÇÏ 33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, these are in the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:19 His prayer, and how God received his entreaty, all his sin and his faithlessness, the sites on which he built high places and set up the sacred poles and the images, before he humbled himself, these are written in the records of the seers.
14´ëÇÏ 33:20 So Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in his house. His son Amon succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 33:21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 33:22 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images that his father Manasseh had made, and served them.
14´ëÇÏ 33:23 He did not humble himself before the LORD, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself, but this Amon incurred more and more guilt.
14´ëÇÏ 33:24 His servants conspired against him and killed him in his house.
14´ëÇÏ 33:25 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made his son Josiah king to succeed him.
14´ëÇÏ 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:2 He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his ancestor David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
14´ëÇÏ 34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the sacred poles, and the carved and the cast images.
14´ëÇÏ 34:4 In his presence they pulled down the altars of the Baals; he demolished the incense altars that stood above them. He broke down the sacred poles and the carved and the cast images; he made dust of them and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
14´ëÇÏ 34:5 He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:6 In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around,
14´ëÇÏ 34:7 he broke down the altars, beat the sacred poles and the images into powder, and demolished all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 34:9 They came to the high priest Hilkiah and delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:10 They delivered it to the workers who had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and the workers who were working in the house of the LORD gave it for repairing and restoring the house.
14´ëÇÏ 34:11 They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders, and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
14´ëÇÏ 34:12 The people did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed the Levites Jahath and Obadiah, of the sons of Merari, along with Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. Other Levites, all skillful with instruments of music,
14´ëÇÏ 34:13 were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.
14´ëÇÏ 34:14 While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, the priest Hilkiah found the book of the law of the LORD given through Moses.
14´ëÇÏ 34:15 Hilkiah said to the secretary Shaphan, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD"; and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
14´ëÇÏ 34:16 Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
14´ëÇÏ 34:17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workers."
14´ëÇÏ 34:18 The secretary Shaphan informed the king, "The priest Hilkiah has given me a book." Shaphan then read it aloud to the king.
14´ëÇÏ 34:19 When the king heard the words of the law he tore his clothes.
14´ëÇÏ 34:20 Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, the secretary Shaphan, and the king's servant Asaiah:
14´ëÇÏ 34:21 "Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found; for the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us is great, because our ancestors did not keep the word of the LORD, to act in accordance with all that is written in this book."
14´ëÇÏ 34:22 So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to the prophet Huldah, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (who lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.
14´ëÇÏ 34:23 She declared to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,
14´ëÇÏ 34:24 Thus says the LORD: I will indeed bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that was read before the king of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 34:25 Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, so that they have provoked me to anger with all the works of their hands, my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.
14´ëÇÏ 34:26 But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,
14´ëÇÏ 34:27 because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 34:28 I will gather you to your ancestors and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place and its inhabitants." They took the message back to the king.
14´ëÇÏ 34:29 Then the king sent word and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:30 The king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small; he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 34:31 The king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
14´ëÇÏ 34:32 Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin pledge themselves to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 34:33 Josiah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel worship the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD the God of their ancestors.
14´ëÇÏ 35:1 Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem; they slaughtered the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
14´ëÇÏ 35:2 He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 35:3 He said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon son of David, king of Israel, built; you need no longer carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 35:4 Make preparations by your ancestral houses by your divisions, following the written directions of King David of Israel and the written directions of his son Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 35:5 Take position in the holy place according to the groupings of the ancestral houses of your kindred the people, and let there be Levites for each division of an ancestral house.
14´ëÇÏ 35:6 Slaughter the passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and on behalf of your kindred make preparations, acting according to the word of the LORD by Moses."
14´ëÇÏ 35:7 Then Josiah contributed to the people, as passover offerings for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the king's possessions.
14´ëÇÏ 35:8 His officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred lambs and kids and three hundred bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:9 Conaniah also, and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:10 When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.
14´ëÇÏ 35:11 They slaughtered the passover lamb, and the priests dashed the blood that they received from them, while the Levites did the skinning.
14´ëÇÏ 35:12 They set aside the burnt offerings so that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the ancestral houses of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And they did the same with the bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:13 They roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the people.
14´ëÇÏ 35:14 Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the descendants of Aaron were occupied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
14´ëÇÏ 35:15 The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and the king's seer Jeduthun. The gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to interrupt their service, for their kindred the Levites made preparations for them.
14´ëÇÏ 35:16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
14´ëÇÏ 35:17 The people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time, and the festival of unleavened bread seven days.
14´ëÇÏ 35:18 No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josiah, by the priests and the Levites, by all Judah and Israel who were present, and by the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 35:19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this passover was kept.
14´ëÇÏ 35:20 After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, King Neco of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.
14´ëÇÏ 35:21 But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, "What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you."
14´ëÇÏ 35:22 But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo.
14´ëÇÏ 35:23 The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."
14´ëÇÏ 35:24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
14´ëÇÏ 35:25 Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these a custom in Israel; they are recorded in the Laments.
14´ëÇÏ 35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his faithful deeds in accordance with what is written in the law of the LORD,
14´ëÇÏ 35:27 and his acts, first and last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 36:1 The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king to succeed his father in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:2 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:3 Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
14´ëÇÏ 36:4 The king of Egypt made his brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and carried him to Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 36:6 Against him King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up, and bound him with fetters to take him to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations that he did, and what was found against him, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.
14´ëÇÏ 36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 36:10 In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, along with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made his brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:12 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 36:13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 36:14 All the leading priests and the people also were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of the LORD that he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:15 The LORD, the God of their ancestors, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place;
14´ëÇÏ 36:16 but they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD against his people became so great that there was no remedy.
14´ëÇÏ 36:17 Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their youths with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or young woman, the aged or the feeble; he gave them all into his hand.
14´ëÇÏ 36:18 All the vessels of the house of God, large and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his officials, all these he brought to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:19 They burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels.
14´ëÇÏ 36:20 He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia,
14´ëÇÏ 36:21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had made up for its sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
14´ëÇÏ 36:22 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in fulfillment of the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom and also declared in a written edict:
14´ëÇÏ 36:23 "Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the LORD his God be with him! Let him go up."
15
15¶ó 1:1 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom, and also in a written edict declared:
15¶ó 1:2 "Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem in Judah.
15¶ó 1:3 Any of those among you who are of his people--may their God be with them!--are now permitted to go up to Jerusalem in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel--he is the God who is in Jerusalem;
15¶ó 1:4 and let all survivors, in whatever place they reside, be assisted by the people of their place with silver and gold, with goods and with animals, besides freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem."
15¶ó 1:5 The heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites--everyone whose spirit God had stirred--got ready to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 1:6 All their neighbors aided them with silver vessels, with gold, with goods, with animals, and with valuable gifts, besides all that was freely offered.
15¶ó 1:7 King Cyrus himself brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
15¶ó 1:8 King Cyrus of Persia had them released into the charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
15¶ó 1:9 And this was the inventory: gold basins, thirty; silver basins, one thousand; knives, twenty-nine;
15¶ó 1:10 gold bowls, thirty; other silver bowls, four hundred ten; other vessels, one thousand;
15¶ó 1:11 the total of the gold and silver vessels was five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.
15¶ó 2:1 Now these were the people of the province who came from those captive exiles whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried captive to Babylonia; they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, all to their own towns.
15¶ó 2:2 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the Israelite people:
15¶ó 2:3 the descendants of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.

15¶ó 2:38 Of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.
15¶ó 2:39 Of Harim, one thousand seventeen.
15¶ó 2:40 The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the descendants of Hodaviah, seventy-four.
15¶ó 2:41 The singers: the descendants of Asaph, one hundred twenty-eight.
15¶ó 2:42 The descendants of the gatekeepers: of Shallum, of Ater, of Talmon, of Akkub, of Hatita, and of Shobai, in all one hundred thirty-nine.
15¶ó 2:43 The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,

15¶ó 2:51 Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,
15¶ó 2:52 Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha,
15¶ó 2:53 Barkos, Sisera, Temah,
15¶ó 2:54 Neziah, and Hatipha.
15¶ó 2:55 The descendants of Solomon's servants: Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,
15¶ó 2:56 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel,
15¶ó 2:57 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth-hazzebaim, and Ami.
15¶ó 2:58 All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants were three hundred ninety-two.
15¶ó 2:59 The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, though they could not prove their families or their descent, whether they belonged to Israel:
15¶ó 2:60 the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.
15¶ó 2:61 Also, of the descendants of the priests: the descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name).
15¶ó 2:62 These looked for their entries in the genealogical records, but they were not found there, and so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean;
15¶ó 2:63 the governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food, until there should be a priest to consult Urim and Thummim.
15¶ó 2:64 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
15¶ó 2:65 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred male and female singers.
15¶ó 2:66 They had seven hundred thirty-six horses, two hundred forty-five mules,
15¶ó 2:67 four hundred thirty-five camels, and six thousand seven hundred twenty donkeys.
15¶ó 2:68 As soon as they came to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of families made freewill offerings for the house of God, to erect it on its site.
15¶ó 2:69 According to their resources they gave to the building fund sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly robes.
15¶ó 2:70 The priests, the Levites, and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and its vicinity; and the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.
15¶ó 3:1 When the seventh month came, and the Israelites were in the towns, the people gathered together in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 3:2 Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his kin set out to build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as prescribed in the law of Moses the man of God.
15¶ó 3:3 They set up the altar on its foundation, because they were in dread of the neighboring peoples, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to the LORD, morning and evening.
15¶ó 3:4 And they kept the festival of booths, as prescribed, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as required for each day,
15¶ó 3:5 and after that the regular burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the sacred festivals of the LORD, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the LORD.
15¶ó 3:6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
15¶ó 3:7 So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from King Cyrus of Persia.
15¶ó 3:8 In the second year after their arrival at the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their people, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work on the house of the LORD.
15¶ó 3:9 And Jeshua with his sons and his kin, and Kadmiel and his sons, Binnui and Hodaviah along with the sons of Henadad, the Levites, their sons and kin, together took charge of the workers in the house of God.
15¶ó 3:10 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments were stationed to praise the LORD with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, according to the directions of King David of Israel;
15¶ó 3:11 and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel." And all the people responded with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
15¶ó 3:12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of families, old people who had seen the first house on its foundations, wept with a loud voice when they saw this house, though many shouted aloud for joy,
15¶ó 3:13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted so loudly that the sound was heard far away.
15¶ó 4:1 When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,
15¶ó 4:2 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of families and said to them, "Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of King Esar-haddon of Assyria who brought us here."
15¶ó 4:3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them, "You shall have no part with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us."
15¶ó 4:4 Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build,
15¶ó 4:5 and they bribed officials to frustrate their plan throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
15¶ó 4:6 In the reign of Ahasuerus, in his accession year, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
15¶ó 4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam and Mithredath and Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to King Artaxerxes of Persia; the letter was written in Aramaic and translated.
15¶ó 4:8 Rehum the royal deputy and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows
15¶ó 4:9 (then Rehum the royal deputy, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the envoys, the officials, the Persians, the people of Erech, the Babylonians, the people of Susa, that is, the Elamites,
15¶ó 4:10 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River wrote--and now
15¶ó 4:11 this is a copy of the letter that they sent): "To King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the people of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now
15¶ó 4:12 may it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city; they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
15¶ó 4:13 Now may it be known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be reduced.
15¶ó 4:14 Now because we share the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king's dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,
15¶ó 4:15 so that a search may be made in the annals of your ancestors. You will discover in the annals that this is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from long ago. On that account this city was laid waste.
15¶ó 4:16 We make known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River."
15¶ó 4:17 The king sent an answer: "To Rehum the royal deputy and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now
15¶ó 4:18 the letter that you sent to us has been read in translation before me.
15¶ó 4:19 So I made a decree, and someone searched and discovered that this city has risen against kings from long ago, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
15¶ó 4:20 Jerusalem has had mighty kings who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, custom, and toll were paid.
15¶ó 4:21 Therefore issue an order that these people be made to cease, and that this city not be rebuilt, until I make a decree.
15¶ó 4:22 Moreover, take care not to be slack in this matter; why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?"
15¶ó 4:23 Then when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum and the scribe Shimshai and their associates, they hurried to the Jews in Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease.
15¶ó 4:24 At that time the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped and was discontinued until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
15¶ó 5:1 Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
15¶ó 5:2 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak set out to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
15¶ó 5:3 At the same time Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, "Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?"
15¶ó 5:4 They also asked them this, "What are the names of the men who are building this building?"
15¶ó 5:5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report reached Darius and then answer was returned by letter in reply to it.
15¶ó 5:6 The copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the envoys who were in the province Beyond the River sent to King Darius;
15¶ó 5:7 they sent him a report, in which was written as follows: "To Darius the king, all peace!
15¶ó 5:8 May it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built of hewn stone, and timber is laid in the walls; this work is being done diligently and prospers in their hands.
15¶ó 5:9 Then we spoke to those elders and asked them, 'Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?'
15¶ó 5:10 We also asked them their names, for your information, so that we might write down the names of the men at their head.
15¶ó 5:11 This was their reply to us: 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
15¶ó 5:12 But because our ancestors had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia.
15¶ó 5:13 However, King Cyrus of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt.
15¶ó 5:14 Moreover, the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem and had brought into the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.
15¶ó 5:15 He said to him, "Take these vessels; go and put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site."
15¶ó 5:16 Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from that time until now it has been under construction, and it is not yet finished.'
15¶ó 5:17 And now, if it seems good to the king, have a search made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by King Cyrus for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. Let the king send us his pleasure in this matter."
15¶ó 6:1 Then King Darius made a decree, and they searched the archives where the documents were stored in Babylon.
15¶ó 6:2 But it was in Ecbatana, the capital in the province of Media, that a scroll was found on which this was written: "A record.
15¶ó 6:3 In the first year of his reign, King Cyrus issued a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices are offered and burnt offerings are brought; its height shall be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits,
15¶ó 6:4 with three courses of hewn stones and one course of timber; let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
15¶ó 6:5 Moreover, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its place; you shall put them in the house of God."
15¶ó 6:6 "Now you, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and you, their associates, the envoys in the province Beyond the River, keep away;
15¶ó 6:7 let the work on this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
15¶ó 6:8 Moreover I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God: the cost is to be paid to these people, in full and without delay, from the royal revenue, the tribute of the province Beyond the River.
15¶ó 6:9 Whatever is needed--young bulls, rams, or sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as the priests in Jerusalem require--let that be given to them day by day without fail,
15¶ó 6:10 so that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his children.
15¶ó 6:11 Furthermore I decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of the house of the perpetrator, who then shall be impaled on it. The house shall be made a dunghill.
15¶ó 6:12 May the God who has established his name there overthrow any king or people that shall put forth a hand to alter this, or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, make a decree; let it be done with all diligence."
15¶ó 6:13 Then, according to the word sent by King Darius, Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what King Darius had ordered.
15¶ó 6:14 So the elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of the prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished their building by command of the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia;
15¶ó 6:15 and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15¶ó 6:16 The people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
15¶ó 6:17 They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
15¶ó 6:18 Then they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
15¶ó 6:19 On the fourteenth day of the first month the returned exiles kept the passover.
15¶ó 6:20 For both the priests and the Levites had purified themselves; all of them were clean. So they killed the passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
15¶ó 6:21 It was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and also by all who had joined them and separated themselves from the pollutions of the nations of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.
15¶ó 6:22 With joy they celebrated the festival of unleavened bread seven days; for the LORD had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, so that he aided them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.
15¶ó 7:1 After this, in the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
15¶ó 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
15¶ó 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
15¶ó 7:4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
15¶ó 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of the chief priest Aaron--
15¶ó 7:6 this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses that the LORD the God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all that he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.
15¶ó 7:7 Some of the people of Israel, and some of the priests and Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple servants also went up to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15¶ó 7:8 They came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
15¶ó 7:9 On the first day of the first month the journey up from Babylon was begun, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the gracious hand of his God was upon him.
15¶ó 7:10 For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach the statutes and ordinances in Israel.
15¶ó 7:11 This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to the priest Ezra, the scribe, a scholar of the text of the commandments of the LORD and his statutes for Israel:
15¶ó 7:12 "Artaxerxes, king of kings, to the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven: Peace. And now
15¶ó 7:13 I decree that any of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom who freely offers to go to Jerusalem may go with you.
15¶ó 7:14 For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to make inquiries about Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your hand,
15¶ó 7:15 and also to convey the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15¶ó 7:16 with all the silver and gold that you shall find in the whole province of Babylonia, and with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, given willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 7:17 With this money, then, you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, and lambs, and their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 7:18 Whatever seems good to you and your colleagues to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do, according to the will of your God.
15¶ó 7:19 The vessels that have been given you for the service of the house of your God, you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
15¶ó 7:20 And whatever else is required for the house of your God, which you are responsible for providing, you may provide out of the king's treasury.
15¶ó 7:21 "I, King Artaxerxes, decree to all the treasurers in the province Beyond the River: Whatever the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, let it be done with all diligence,
15¶ó 7:22 up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred cors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and unlimited salt.
15¶ó 7:23 Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, or wrath will come upon the realm of the king and his heirs.
15¶ó 7:24 We also notify you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
15¶ó 7:25 "And you, Ezra, according to the God-given wisdom you possess, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people in the province Beyond the River who know the laws of your God; and you shall teach those who do not know them.
15¶ó 7:26 All who will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be strictly executed on them, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of their goods or for imprisonment."
15¶ó 7:27 Blessed be the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who put such a thing as this into the heart of the king to glorify the house of the LORD in Jerusalem,
15¶ó 7:28 and who extended to me steadfast love before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty officers. I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me.
15¶ó 8:1 These are their family heads, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia, in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
15¶ó 8:2 Of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom. Of Ithamar, Daniel. Of David, Hattush,
15¶ó 8:3 of the descendants of Shecaniah. Of Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered one hundred fifty males.
15¶ó 8:4 Of the descendants of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
15¶ó 8:5 Of the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
15¶ó 8:6 Of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
15¶ó 8:7 Of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
15¶ó 8:8 Of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
15¶ó 8:9 Of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred eighteen males.
15¶ó 8:10 Of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred sixty males.
15¶ó 8:11 Of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.
15¶ó 8:12 Of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred ten males.
15¶ó 8:13 Of the descendants of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
15¶ó 8:14 Of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them seventy males.
15¶ó 8:15 I gathered them by the river that runs to Ahava, and there we camped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the descendants of Levi.
15¶ó 8:16 Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise,
15¶ó 8:17 and sent them to Iddo, the leader at the place called Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his colleagues the temple servants at Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.
15¶ó 8:18 Since the gracious hand of our God was upon us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the descendants of Mahli son of Levi son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and kin, eighteen;
15¶ó 8:19 also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the descendants of Merari, with his kin and their sons, twenty;
15¶ó 8:20 besides two hundred twenty of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.
15¶ó 8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might deny ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions.
15¶ó 8:22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and his wrath are against all who forsake him.
15¶ó 8:23 So we fasted and petitioned our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.
15¶ó 8:24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kin with them.
15¶ó 8:25 And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel there present had offered;
15¶ó 8:26 I weighed out into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and one hundred silver vessels worth. . . talents, and one hundred talents of gold,
15¶ó 8:27 twenty gold bowls worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine polished bronze as precious as gold.
15¶ó 8:28 And I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your ancestors.
15¶ó 8:29 Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of families in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD."
15¶ó 8:30 So the priests and the Levites took over the silver, the gold, and the vessels as they were weighed out, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.
15¶ó 8:31 Then we left the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes along the way.
15¶ó 8:32 We came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
15¶ó 8:33 On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver, the gold, and the vessels were weighed into the hands of the priest Meremoth son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
15¶ó 8:34 The total was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.
15¶ó 8:35 At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats; all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
15¶ó 8:36 They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they supported the people and the house of God.
15¶ó 9:1 After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
15¶ó 9:2 For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way."
15¶ó 9:3 When I heard this, I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled.
15¶ó 9:4 Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.
15¶ó 9:5 At the evening sacrifice I got up from my fasting, with my garments and my mantle torn, and fell on my knees, spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
15¶ó 9:6 and said, "O my God, I am too ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.
15¶ó 9:7 From the days of our ancestors to this day we have been deep in guilt, and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as is now the case.
15¶ó 9:8 But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, who has left us a remnant, and given us a stake in his holy place, in order that he may brighten our eyes and grant us a little sustenance in our slavery.
15¶ó 9:9 For we are slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to give us new life to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judea and Jerusalem.
15¶ó 9:10 "And now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,
15¶ó 9:11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations. They have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.
15¶ó 9:12 Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.'
15¶ó 9:13 After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this,
15¶ó 9:14 shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you destroy us without remnant or survivor?
15¶ó 9:15 O LORD, God of Israel, you are just, but we have escaped as a remnant, as is now the case. Here we are before you in our guilt, though no one can face you because of this."
15¶ó 10:1 While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him out of Israel; the people also wept bitterly.
15¶ó 10:2 Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the descendants of Elam, addressed Ezra, saying, "We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
15¶ó 10:3 So now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
15¶ó 10:4 Take action, for it is your duty, and we are with you; be strong, and do it."
15¶ó 10:5 Then Ezra stood up and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear that they would do as had been said. So they swore.
15¶ó 10:6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, where he spent the night. He did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.
15¶ó 10:7 They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
15¶ó 10:8 and that if any did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all their property should be forfeited, and they themselves banned from the congregation of the exiles.
15¶ó 10:9 Then all the people of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
15¶ó 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.
15¶ó 10:11 Now make confession to the LORD the God of your ancestors, and do his will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."
15¶ó 10:12 Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, "It is so; we must do as you have said.
15¶ó 10:13 But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for many of us have transgressed in this matter.
15¶ó 10:14 Let our officials represent the whole assembly, and let all in our towns who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every town, until the fierce wrath of our God on this account is averted from us."
15¶ó 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levites supported them.
15¶ó 10:16 Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, heads of families, according to their families, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter.
15¶ó 10:17 By the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.
15¶ó 10:18 There were found of the descendants of the priests who had married foreign women, of the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
15¶ó 10:19 They pledged themselves to send away their wives, and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt.
15¶ó 10:20 Of the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
15¶ó 10:21 Of the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
15¶ó 10:22 Of the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
15¶ó 10:23 Of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
15¶ó 10:24 Of the singers: Eliashib. Of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
15¶ó 10:25 And of Israel: of the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Hashabiah, and Benaiah.
15¶ó 10:26 Of the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
15¶ó 10:27 Of the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
15¶ó 10:28 Of the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
15¶ó 10:29 Of the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
15¶ó 10:30 Of the descendants of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
15¶ó 10:31 Of the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
15¶ó 10:32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
15¶ó 10:33 Of the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
15¶ó 10:34 Of the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
15¶ó 10:35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
15¶ó 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
15¶ó 10:37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu.
15¶ó 10:38 Of the descendants of Binnui: Shimei,

16´À 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capital,
16´À 1:2 one of my brothers, Hanani, came with certain men from Judah; and I asked them about the Jews that survived, those who had escaped the captivity, and about Jerusalem.
16´À 1:3 They replied, "The survivors there in the province who escaped captivity are in great trouble and shame; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been destroyed by fire."
16´À 1:4 When I heard these words I sat down and wept, and mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
16´À 1:5 I said, "O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments;
16´À 1:6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Both I and my family have sinned.
16´À 1:7 We have offended you deeply, failing to keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances that you commanded your servant Moses.
16´À 1:8 Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples;
16´À 1:9 but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place at which I have chosen to establish my name.'
16´À 1:10 They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great power and your strong hand.
16´À 1:11 O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man!" At the time, I was cupbearer to the king.
16´À 2:1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was served him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been sad in his presence before.
16´À 2:2 So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This can only be sadness of the heart." Then I was very much afraid.
16´À 2:3 I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my ancestors' graves, lies waste, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
16´À 2:4 Then the king said to me, "What do you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.
16´À 2:5 Then I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors' graves, so that I may rebuild it."
16´À 2:6 The king said to me (the queen also was sitting beside him), "How long will you be gone, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a date.
16´À 2:7 Then I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may grant me passage until I arrive in Judah;
16´À 2:8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, directing him to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy." And the king granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me.
16´À 2:9 Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and cavalry with me.
16´À 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel.
16´À 2:11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.
16´À 2:12 Then I got up during the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the animal I rode.
16´À 2:13 I went out by night by the Valley Gate past the Dragon's Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.
16´À 2:14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool; but there was no place for the animal I was riding to continue.
16´À 2:15 So I went up by way of the valley by night and inspected the wall. Then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
16´À 2:16 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest that were to do the work.
16´À 2:17 Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer suffer disgrace."
16´À 2:18 I told them that the hand of my God had been gracious upon me, and also the words that the king had spoken to me. Then they said, "Let us start building!" So they committed themselves to the common good.
16´À 2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they mocked and ridiculed us, saying, "What is this that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"
16´À 2:20 Then I replied to them, "The God of heaven is the one who will give us success, and we his servants are going to start building; but you have no share or claim or historic right in Jerusalem."
16´À 3:1 Then the high priest Eliashib set to work with his fellow priests and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set up its doors; they consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred and as far as the Tower of Hananel.
16´À 3:2 And the men of Jericho built next to him. And next to them Zaccur son of Imri built.
16´À 3:3 The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
16´À 3:4 Next to them Meremoth son of Uriah son of Hakkoz made repairs. Next to them Meshullam son of Berechiah son of Meshezabel made repairs. Next to them Zadok son of Baana made repairs.
16´À 3:5 Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord.
16´À 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
16´À 3:7 Next to them repairs were made by Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite--the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah--who were under the jurisdiction of the governor of the province Beyond the River.
16´À 3:8 Next to them Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16´À 3:9 Next to them Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs.
16´À 3:10 Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house; and next to him Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
16´À 3:11 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.
16´À 3:12 Next to him Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters.
16´À 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate; they rebuilt it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall, as far as the Dung Gate.
16´À 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
16´À 3:15 And Shallum son of Col-hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it and covered it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars; and he built the wall of the Pool of Shelah of the king's garden, as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David.
16´À 3:16 After him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, repaired from a point opposite the graves of David, as far as the artificial pool and the house of the warriors.
16´À 3:17 After him the Levites made repairs: Rehum son of Bani; next to him Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district.
16´À 3:18 After him their kin made repairs: Binnui, son of Henadad, ruler of half the district of Keilah;
16´À 3:19 next to him Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle.
16´À 3:20 After him Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of the high priest Eliashib.
16´À 3:21 After him Meremoth son of Uriah son of Hakkoz repaired another section from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib.
16´À 3:22 After him the priests, the men of the surrounding area, made repairs.
16´À 3:23 After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. After them Azariah son of Maaseiah son of Ananiah made repairs beside his own house.
16´À 3:24 After him Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the Angle and to the corner.
16´À 3:25 Palal son of Uzai repaired opposite the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper house of the king at the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah son of Parosh
16´À 3:26 and the temple servants living on Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower.
16´À 3:27 After him the Tekoites repaired another section opposite the great projecting tower as far as the wall of Ophel.
16´À 3:28 Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one opposite his own house.
16´À 3:29 After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs.
16´À 3:30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.
16´À 3:31 After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, opposite the Muster Gate, and to the upper room of the corner.
16´À 3:32 And between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
16´À 4:1 Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he mocked the Jews.
16´À 4:2 He said in the presence of his associates and of the army of Samaria, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish--and burned ones at that?"
16´À 4:3 Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, "That stone wall they are building--any fox going up on it would break it down!"
16´À 4:4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their taunt back on their own heads, and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.
16´À 4:5 Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from your sight; for they have hurled insults in the face of the builders.
16´À 4:6 So we rebuilt the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half its height; for the people had a mind to work.
16´À 4:7 But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the gaps were beginning to be closed, they were very angry,
16´À 4:8 and all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
16´À 4:9 So we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
16´À 4:10 But Judah said, "The strength of the burden bearers is failing, and there is too much rubbish so that we are unable to work on the wall."
16´À 4:11 And our enemies said, "They will not know or see anything before we come upon them and kill them and stop the work."
16´À 4:12 When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times, "From all the places where they live they will come up against us."
16´À 4:13 So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
16´À 4:14 After I looked these things over, I stood up and said to the nobles and the officials and the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the LORD, who is great and awesome, and fight for your kin, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."
16´À 4:15 When our enemies heard that their plot was known to us, and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
16´À 4:16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and body-armor; and the leaders posted themselves behind the whole house of Judah,
16´À 4:17 who were building the wall. The burden bearers carried their loads in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and with the other held a weapon.
16´À 4:18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
16´À 4:19 And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is great and widely spread out, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.
16´À 4:20 Rally to us wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet. Our God will fight for us."
16´À 4:21 So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from break of dawn until the stars came out.
16´À 4:22 I also said to the people at that time, "Let every man and his servant pass the night inside Jerusalem, so that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day."
16´À 4:23 So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me ever took off our clothes; each kept his weapon in his right hand.
16´À 5:1 Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish kin.
16´À 5:2 For there were those who said, "With our sons and our daughters, we are many; we must get grain, so that we may eat and stay alive."
16´À 5:3 There were also those who said, "We are having to pledge our fields, our vineyards, and our houses in order to get grain during the famine."
16´À 5:4 And there were those who said, "We are having to borrow money on our fields and vineyards to pay the king's tax.
16´À 5:5 Now our flesh is the same as that of our kindred; our children are the same as their children; and yet we are forcing our sons and daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been ravished; we are powerless, and our fields and vineyards now belong to others."
16´À 5:6 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
16´À 5:7 After thinking it over, I brought charges against the nobles and the officials; I said to them, "You are all taking interest from your own people." And I called a great assembly to deal with them,
16´À 5:8 and said to them, "As far as we were able, we have bought back our Jewish kindred who had been sold to other nations; but now you are selling your own kin, who must then be bought back by us!" They were silent, and could not find a word to say.
16´À 5:9 So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God, to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies?
16´À 5:10 Moreover I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us stop this taking of interest.
16´À 5:11 Restore to them, this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the interest on money, grain, wine, and oil that you have been exacting from them."
16´À 5:12 Then they said, "We will restore everything and demand nothing more from them. We will do as you say." And I called the priests, and made them take an oath to do as they had promised.
16´À 5:13 I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, "So may God shake out everyone from house and from property who does not perform this promise. Thus may they be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
16´À 5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor.
16´À 5:15 The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people, and took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.
16´À 5:16 Indeed, I devoted myself to the work on this wall, and acquired no land; and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
16´À 5:17 Moreover there were at my table one hundred fifty people, Jews and officials, beside those who came to us from the nations around us.
16´À 5:18 Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of wine in abundance; yet with all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because of the heavy burden of labor on the people.
16´À 5:19 Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.
16´À 6:1 Now when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was no gap left in it (though up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
16´À 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono." But they intended to do me harm.
16´À 6:3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?"
16´À 6:4 They sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner.
16´À 6:5 In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
16´À 6:6 In it was written, "It is reported among the nations--and Geshem also says it--that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall; and according to this report you wish to become their king.
16´À 6:7 You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, 'There is a king in Judah!' And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So come, therefore, and let us confer together."
16´À 6:8 Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say have been done; you are inventing them out of your own mind"
16´À 6:9 --for they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen my hands.
16´À 6:10 One day when I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, tonight they are coming to kill you."
16´À 6:11 But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!"
16´À 6:12 Then I perceived and saw that God had not sent him at all, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16´À 6:13 He was hired for this purpose, to intimidate me and make me sin by acting in this way, and so they could give me a bad name, in order to taunt me.
16´À 6:14 Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.
16´À 6:15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
16´À 6:16 And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
16´À 6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.
16´À 6:18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
16´À 6:19 Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16´À 7:1 Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,
16´À 7:2 I gave my brother Hanani charge over Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel--for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
16´À 7:3 And I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot; while the gatekeepers are still standing guard, let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, some at their watch posts, and others before their own houses."
16´À 7:4 The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few and no houses had been built.
16´À 7:5 Then my God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who were the first to come back, and I found the following written in it:
16´À 7:6 These are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried into exile; they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town.
16´À 7:7 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the Israelite people:

16´À 7:41 Of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.

16´À 7:44 The singers: the descendants of Asaph, one hundred forty-eight.
16´À 7:45 The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, of Ater, of Talmon, of Akkub, of Hatita, of Shobai, one hundred thirty-eight.
16´À 7:46 The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, of Hasupha, of Tabbaoth,
16´À 7:47 of Keros, of Sia, of Padon,
16´À 7:48 of Lebana, of Hagaba, of Shalmai,

16´À 7:57 The descendants of Solomon's servants: of Sotai, of Sophereth, of Perida,
16´À 7:58 of Jaala, of Darkon, of Giddel,
16´À 7:59 of Shephatiah, of Hattil, of Pochereth-hazzebaim, of Amon.
16´À 7:60 All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants were three hundred ninety-two.
16´À 7:61 The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their ancestral houses or their descent, whether they belonged to Israel:
16´À 7:62 the descendants of Delaiah, of Tobiah, of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
16´À 7:63 Also, of the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, of Hakkoz, of Barzillai (who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).
16´À 7:64 These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean;
16´À 7:65 the governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food, until a priest with Urim and Thummim should come.
16´À 7:66 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
16´À 7:67 besides their male and female slaves, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred forty-five singers, male and female.
16´À 7:68 They had seven hundred thirty-six horses, two hundred forty-five mules,
16´À 7:69 four hundred thirty-five camels, and six thousand seven hundred twenty donkeys.
16´À 7:70 Now some of the heads of ancestral houses contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred thirty priestly robes.
16´À 7:71 And some of the heads of ancestral houses gave into the building fund twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred minas of silver.
16´À 7:72 And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priestly robes.
16´À 7:73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel settled in their towns. When the seventh month came--the people of Israel being settled in their towns--
16´À 8:1 all the people gathered together into the square before the Water Gate. They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had given to Israel.
16´À 8:2 Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding. This was on the first day of the seventh month.
16´À 8:3 He read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
16´À 8:4 The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden platform that had been made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand.
16´À 8:5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
16´À 8:6 Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, "Amen, Amen," lifting up their hands. Then they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
16´À 8:7 Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the law, while the people remained in their places.
16´À 8:8 So they read from the book, from the law of God, with interpretation. They gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.
16´À 8:9 And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
16´À 8:10 Then he said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions of them to those for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to our LORD; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
16´À 8:11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, "Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved."
16´À 8:12 And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
16´À 8:13 On the second day the heads of ancestral houses of all the people, with the priests and the Levites, came together to the scribe Ezra in order to study the words of the law.
16´À 8:14 And they found it written in the law, which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the people of Israel should live in booths during the festival of the seventh month,
16´À 8:15 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their towns and in Jerusalem as follows, "Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written."
16´À 8:16 So the people went out and brought them, and made booths for themselves, each on the roofs of their houses, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.
16´À 8:17 And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them; for from the days of Jeshua son of Nun to that day the people of Israel had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing.
16´À 8:18 And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the book of the law of God. They kept the festival seven days; and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
16´À 9:1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the people of Israel were assembled with fasting and in sackcloth, and with earth on their heads.
16´À 9:2 Then those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
16´À 9:3 They stood up in their place and read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth part of the day, and for another fourth they made confession and worshiped the LORD their God.
16´À 9:4 Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
16´À 9:5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, "Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
16´À 9:6 And Ezra said: "You are the LORD, you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. To all of them you give life, and the host of heaven worships you.
16´À 9:7 You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham;
16´À 9:8 and you found his heart faithful before you, and made with him a covenant to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite; and you have fulfilled your promise, for you are righteous.
16´À 9:9 "And you saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16´À 9:10 You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted insolently against our ancestors. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day.
16´À 9:11 And you divided the sea before them, so that they passed through the sea on dry land, but you threw their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
16´À 9:12 Moreover, you led them by day with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire, to give them light on the way in which they should go.
16´À 9:13 You came down also upon Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
16´À 9:14 and you made known your holy sabbath to them and gave them commandments and statutes and a law through your servant Moses.
16´À 9:15 For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven, and for their thirst you brought water for them out of the rock, and you told them to go in to possess the land that you swore to give them.
16´À 9:16 "But they and our ancestors acted presumptuously and stiffened their necks and did not obey your commandments;
16´À 9:17 they refused to obey, and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them; but they stiffened their necks and determined to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and you did not forsake them.
16´À 9:18 Even when they had cast an image of a calf for themselves and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and had committed great blasphemies,
16´À 9:19 you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud that led them in the way did not leave them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night that gave them light on the way by which they should go.
16´À 9:20 You gave your good spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and gave them water for their thirst.
16´À 9:21 Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
16´À 9:22 And you gave them kingdoms and peoples, and allotted to them every corner, so they took possession of the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of King Og of Bashan.
16´À 9:23 You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land that you had told their ancestors to enter and possess.
16´À 9:24 So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them as they pleased.
16´À 9:25 And they captured fortress cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses filled with all sorts of goods, hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive orchards, and fruit trees in abundance; so they ate, and were filled and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.
16´À 9:26 "Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their backs and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies.
16´À 9:27 Therefore you gave them into the hands of their enemies, who made them suffer. Then in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hands of their enemies.
16´À 9:28 But after they had rest, they again did evil before you, and you abandoned them to the hands of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you rescued them according to your mercies.
16´À 9:29 And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, by the observance of which a person shall live. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey.
16´À 9:30 Many years you were patient with them, and warned them by your spirit through your prophets; yet they would not listen. Therefore you handed them over to the peoples of the lands.
16´À 9:31 Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
16´À 9:32 "Now therefore, our God--the great and mighty and awesome God, keeping covenant and steadfast love--do not treat lightly all the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until today.
16´À 9:33 You have been just in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly;
16´À 9:34 our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law or heeded the commandments and the warnings that you gave them.
16´À 9:35 Even in their own kingdom, and in the great goodness you bestowed on them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you and did not turn from their wicked works.
16´À 9:36 Here we are, slaves to this day--slaves in the land that you gave to our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts.
16´À 9:37 Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins; they have power also over our bodies and over our livestock at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
16´À 9:38 Because of all this we make a firm agreement in writing, and on that sealed document are inscribed the names of our officials, our Levites, and our priests.
16´À 10:1 Upon the sealed document are the names of Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah;
16´À 10:2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
16´À 10:3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
16´À 10:4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
16´À 10:5 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
16´À 10:6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
16´À 10:7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
16´À 10:8 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah; these are the priests.
16´À 10:9 And the Levites: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
16´À 10:10 and their associates, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
16´À 10:11 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
16´À 10:12 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
16´À 10:13 Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.
16´À 10:14 The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
16´À 10:15 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16´À 10:16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
16´À 10:17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
16´À 10:18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
16´À 10:19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
16´À 10:20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
16´À 10:21 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
16´À 10:22 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
16´À 10:23 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
16´À 10:24 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
16´À 10:25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
16´À 10:26 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
16´À 10:27 Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
16´À 10:28 The rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all who have separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to adhere to the law of God, their wives, their sons, their daughters, all who have knowledge and understanding,
16´À 10:29 join with their kin, their nobles, and enter into a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord and his ordinances and his statutes.
16´À 10:30 We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons;
16´À 10:31 and if the peoples of the land bring in merchandise or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy it from them on the sabbath or on a holy day; and we will forego the crops of the seventh year and the exaction of every debt.
16´À 10:32 We also lay on ourselves the obligation to charge ourselves yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
16´À 10:33 for the rows of bread, the regular grain offering, the regular burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moons, the appointed festivals, the sacred donations, and the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
16´À 10:34 We have also cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, by ancestral houses, at appointed times, year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law.
16´À 10:35 We obligate ourselves to bring the first fruits of our soil and the first fruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the LORD;
16´À 10:36 also to bring to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God, the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks;
16´À 10:37 and to bring the first of our dough, and our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the wine and the oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and to bring to the Levites the tithes from our soil, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our rural towns.
16´À 10:38 And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.
16´À 10:39 For the people of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of grain, wine, and oil to the storerooms where the vessels of the sanctuary are, and where the priests that minister, and the gatekeepers and the singers are. We will not neglect the house of our God.
16´À 11:1 Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem; and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in the holy city Jerusalem, while nine-tenths remained in the other towns.
16´À 11:2 And the people blessed all those who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem.
16´À 11:3 These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem; but in the towns of Judah all lived on their property in their towns: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
16´À 11:4 And in Jerusalem lived some of the Judahites and of the Benjaminites. Of the Judahites: Athaiah son of Uzziah son of Zechariah son of Amariah son of Shephatiah son of Mahalalel, of the descendants of Perez;
16´À 11:5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch son of Col-hozeh son of Hazaiah son of Adaiah son of Joiarib son of Zechariah son of the Shilonite.
16´À 11:6 All the descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty-eight valiant warriors.
16´À 11:7 And these are the Benjaminites: Sallu son of Meshullam son of Joed son of Pedaiah son of Kolaiah son of Maaseiah son of Ithiel son of Jeshaiah.
16´À 11:8 And his brothers Gabbai, Sallai: nine hundred twenty-eight.
16´À 11:9 Joel son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in charge of the city.
16´À 11:10 Of the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jachin,
16´À 11:11 Seraiah son of Hilkiah son of Meshullam son of Zadok son of Meraioth son of Ahitub, officer of the house of God,
16´À 11:12 and their associates who did the work of the house, eight hundred twenty-two; and Adaiah son of Jeroham son of Pelaliah son of Amzi son of Zechariah son of Pashhur son of Malchijah,
16´À 11:13 and his associates, heads of ancestral houses, two hundred forty-two; and Amashsai son of Azarel son of Ahzai son of Meshillemoth son of Immer,
16´À 11:14 and their associates, valiant warriors, one hundred twenty-eight; their overseer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.
16´À 11:15 And of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah son of Bunni;
16´À 11:16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the leaders of the Levites, who were over the outside work of the house of God;
16´À 11:17 and Mattaniah son of Mica son of Zabdi son of Asaph, who was the leader to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua son of Galal son of Jeduthun.
16´À 11:18 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four.
16´À 11:19 The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at the gates, were one hundred seventy-two.
16´À 11:20 And the rest of Israel, and of the priests and the Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, all of them in their inheritance.
16´À 11:21 But the temple servants lived on Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants.
16´À 11:22 The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani son of Hashabiah son of Mattaniah son of Mica, of the descendants of Asaph, the singers, in charge of the work of the house of God.
16´À 11:23 For there was a command from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as was required every day.
16´À 11:24 And Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.
16´À 11:25 And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,
16´À 11:26 and in Jeshua and in Moladah and Beth-pelet,
16´À 11:27 in Hazar-shual, in Beer-sheba and its villages,
16´À 11:28 in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages,
16´À 11:29 in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
16´À 11:30 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its villages. So they camped from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom.
16´À 11:31 The people of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages,
16´À 11:32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
16´À 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
16´À 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
16´À 11:35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of artisans.
16´À 11:36 And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah were joined to Benjamin.
16´À 12:1 These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16´À 12:2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16´À 12:3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16´À 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
16´À 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
16´À 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16´À 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and of their associates in the days of Jeshua.
16´À 12:8 And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
16´À 12:9 And Bakbukiah and Unno their associates stood opposite them in the service.
16´À 12:10 Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada,
16´À 12:11 Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua.
16´À 12:12 In the days of Joiakim the priests, heads of ancestral houses, were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
16´À 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
16´À 12:14 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
16´À 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
16´À 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
16´À 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
16´À 12:18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
16´À 12:19 of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
16´À 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
16´À 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
16´À 12:22 As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of ancestral houses; also the priests until the reign of Darius the Persian.
16´À 12:23 The Levites, heads of ancestral houses, were recorded in the Book of the Annals until the days of Johanan son of Eliashib.
16´À 12:24 And the leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their associates over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, section opposite to section.
16´À 12:25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storehouses of the gates.
16´À 12:26 These were in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and in the days of the governor Nehemiah and of the priest Ezra, the scribe.
16´À 12:27 Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with rejoicing, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres.
16´À 12:28 The companies of the singers gathered together from the circuit around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
16´À 12:29 also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem.
16´À 12:30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.
16´À 12:31 Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate;
16´À 12:32 and after them went Hoshaiah and half the officials of Judah,
16´À 12:33 and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16´À 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
16´À 12:35 and some of the young priests with trumpets: Zechariah son of Jonathan son of Shemaiah son of Mattaniah son of Micaiah son of Zaccur son of Asaph;
16´À 12:36 and his kindred, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and the scribe Ezra went in front of them.
16´À 12:37 At the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went straight up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.
16´À 12:38 The other company of those who gave thanks went to the left, and I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall,
16´À 12:39 and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard.
16´À 12:40 So both companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and half of the officials with me;
16´À 12:41 and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
16´À 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader.
16´À 12:43 They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.
16´À 12:44 On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites from the fields belonging to the towns; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.
16´À 12:45 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.
16´À 12:46 For in the days of David and Asaph long ago there was a leader of the singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16´À 12:47 In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants of Aaron.
16´À 13:1 On that day they read from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
16´À 13:2 because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them--yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16´À 13:3 When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent.
16´À 13:4 Now before this, the priest Eliashib, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to Tobiah,
16´À 13:5 prepared for Tobiah a large room where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
16´À 13:6 While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon I went to the king. After some time I asked leave of the king
16´À 13:7 and returned to Jerusalem. I then discovered the wrong that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah, preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
16´À 13:8 And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the room.
16´À 13:9 Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
16´À 13:10 I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them; so that the Levites and the singers, who had conducted the service, had gone back to their fields.
16´À 13:11 So I remonstrated with the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together and set them in their stations.
16´À 13:12 Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.
16´À 13:13 And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah, the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful; and their duty was to distribute to their associates.
16´À 13:14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.
16´À 13:15 In those days I saw in Judah people treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys; and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them at that time against selling food.
16´À 13:16 Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of merchandise and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
16´À 13:17 Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?
16´À 13:18 Did not your ancestors act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath."
16´À 13:19 When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates, to prevent any burden from being brought in on the sabbath day.
16´À 13:20 Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.
16´À 13:21 But I warned them and said to them, "Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.
16´À 13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.
16´À 13:23 In those days also I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;
16´À 13:24 and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke the language of various peoples.
16´À 13:25 And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
16´À 13:26 Did not King Solomon of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin.
16´À 13:27 Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"
16´À 13:28 And one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; I chased him away from me.
16´À 13:29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, the covenant of the priests and the Levites.
16´À 13:30 Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;
16´À 13:31 and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

17´õ 1:1 This happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the same Ahasuerus who ruled over one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia.
17´õ 1:2 In those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,
17´õ 1:3 in the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his officials and ministers. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were present,
17´õ 1:4 while he displayed the great wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and pomp of his majesty for many days, one hundred eighty days in all.
17´õ 1:5 When these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in the citadel of Susa, both great and small, a banquet lasting for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
17´õ 1:6 There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings tied with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and colored stones.
17´õ 1:7 Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.
17´õ 1:8 Drinking was by flagons, without restraint; for the king had given orders to all the officials of his palace to do as each one desired.
17´õ 1:9 Furthermore, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the palace of King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who attended him,
17´õ 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing the royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the officials her beauty; for she was fair to behold.
17´õ 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command conveyed by the eunuchs. At this the king was enraged, and his anger burned within him.
17´õ 1:13 Then the king consulted the sages who knew the laws (for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and custom,
17´õ 1:14 and those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media, who had access to the king, and sat first in the kingdom):
17´õ 1:15 "According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs?"
17´õ 1:16 Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, "Not only has Queen Vashti done wrong to the king, but also to all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 1:17 For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, since they will say, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.'
17´õ 1:18 This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will rebel against the king's officials, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath!
17´õ 1:19 If it pleases the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.
17´õ 1:20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike."
17´õ 1:21 This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan proposed;
17´õ 1:22 he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, declaring that every man should be master in his own house.
17´õ 2:1 After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
17´õ 2:2 Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.
17´õ 2:3 And let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in the citadel of Susa under custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; let their cosmetic treatments be given them.
17´õ 2:4 And let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This pleased the king, and he did so.
17´õ 2:5 Now there was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish, a Benjaminite.
17´õ 2:6 Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with King Jeconiah of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried away.
17´õ 2:7 Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is Esther, his cousin, for she had neither father nor mother; the girl was fair and beautiful, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter.
17´õ 2:8 So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young women were gathered in the citadel of Susa in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.
17´õ 2:9 The girl pleased him and won his favor, and he quickly provided her with her cosmetic treatments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids from the king's palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
17´õ 2:10 Esther did not reveal her people or kindred, for Mordecai had charged her not to tell.
17´õ 2:11 Every day Mordecai would walk around in front of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
17´õ 2:12 The turn came for each girl to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their cosmetic treatment, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women.
17´õ 2:13 When the girl went in to the king she was given whatever she asked for to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
17´õ 2:14 In the evening she went in; then in the morning she came back to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
17´õ 2:15 When the turn came for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was admired by all who saw her.
17´õ 2:16 When Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,
17´õ 2:17 the king loved Esther more than all the other women; of all the virgins she won his favor and devotion, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17´õ 2:18 Then the king gave a great banquet to all his officials and ministers--"Esther's banquet." He also granted a holiday to the provinces, and gave gifts with royal liberality.
17´õ 2:19 When the virgins were being gathered together, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
17´õ 2:20 Now Esther had not revealed her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him.
17´õ 2:21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 2:22 But the matter came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai.
17´õ 2:23 When the affair was investigated and found to be so, both the men were hanged on the gallows. It was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
17´õ 3:1 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the officials who were with him.
17´õ 3:2 And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance.
17´õ 3:3 Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"
17´õ 3:4 When they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
17´õ 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was infuriated.
17´õ 3:6 But he thought it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, having been told who Mordecai's people were, Haman plotted to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
17´õ 3:7 In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur--which means "the lot"--before Haman for the day and for the month, and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
17´õ 3:8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not appropriate for the king to tolerate them.
17´õ 3:9 If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued for their destruction, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, so that they may put it into the king's treasuries."
17´õ 3:10 So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17´õ 3:11 The king said to Haman, "The money is given to you, and the people as well, to do with them as it seems good to you."
17´õ 3:12 Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.
17´õ 3:13 Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces, giving orders to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
17´õ 3:14 A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation, calling on all the peoples to be ready for that day.
17´õ 3:15 The couriers went quickly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.
17´õ 4:1 When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry;
17´õ 4:2 he went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one might enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
17´õ 4:3 In every province, wherever the king's command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.
17´õ 4:4 When Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth; but he would not accept them.
17´õ 4:5 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what was happening and why.
17´õ 4:6 Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,
17´õ 4:7 and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
17´õ 4:8 Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther, explain it to her, and charge her to go to the king to make supplication to him and entreat him for her people.
17´õ 4:9 Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
17´õ 4:10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mordecai, saying,
17´õ 4:11 "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law--all alike are to be put to death. Only if the king holds out the golden scepter to someone, may that person live. I myself have not been called to come in to the king for thirty days."
17´õ 4:12 When they told Mordecai what Esther had said,
17´õ 4:13 Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not think that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.
17´õ 4:14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father's family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this."
17´õ 4:15 Then Esther said in reply to Mordecai,
17´õ 4:16 "Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."
17´õ 4:17 Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
17´õ 5:1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace.
17´õ 5:2 As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won his favor and he held out to her the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.
17´õ 5:3 The king said to her, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom."
17´õ 5:4 Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet that I have prepared for the king."
17´õ 5:5 Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
17´õ 5:6 While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."
17´õ 5:7 Then Esther said, "This is my petition and request:
17´õ 5:8 If I have won the king's favor, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and then I will do as the king has said."
17´õ 5:9 Haman went out that day happy and in good spirits. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and observed that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was infuriated with Mordecai;
17´õ 5:10 nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. Then he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh,
17´õ 5:11 and Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the ministers of the king.
17´õ 5:12 Haman added, "Even Queen Esther let no one but myself come with the king to the banquet that she prepared. Tomorrow also I am invited by her, together with the king.
17´õ 5:13 Yet all this does me no good so long as I see the Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate."
17´õ 5:14 Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go with the king to the banquet in good spirits." This advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.
17´õ 6:1 On that night the king could not sleep, and he gave orders to bring the book of records, the annals, and they were read to the king.
17´õ 6:2 It was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 6:3 Then the king said, "What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?" The king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."
17´õ 6:4 The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
17´õ 6:5 So the king's servants told him, "Haman is there, standing in the court." The king said, "Let him come in."
17´õ 6:6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "What shall be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?"
17´õ 6:7 So Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king wishes to honor,
17´õ 6:8 let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and a horse that the king has ridden, with a royal crown on its head.
17´õ 6:9 Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials; let him robe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him conduct the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him: 'Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.'"
17´õ 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, "Quickly, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to the Jew Mordecai who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned."
17´õ 6:11 So Haman took the robes and the horse and robed Mordecai and led him riding through the open square of the city, proclaiming, "Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor."
17´õ 6:12 Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
17´õ 6:13 When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him."
17´õ 6:14 While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman off to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
17´õ 7:1 So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.
17´õ 7:2 On the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."
17´õ 7:3 Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have won your favor, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me--that is my petition--and the lives of my people--that is my request.
17´õ 7:4 For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; but no enemy can compensate for this damage to the king."
17´õ 7:5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who has presumed to do this?"
17´õ 7:6 Esther said, "A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman!" Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.
17´õ 7:7 The king rose from the feast in wrath and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that the king had determined to destroy him.
17´õ 7:8 When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had thrown himself on the couch where Esther was reclining; and the king said, "Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?" As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face.
17´õ 7:9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, "Look, the very gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, stands at Haman's house, fifty cubits high." And the king said, "Hang him on that."
17´õ 7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the anger of the king abated.
17´õ 8:1 On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her.
17´õ 8:2 Then the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. So Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
17´õ 8:3 Then Esther spoke again to the king; she fell at his feet, weeping and pleading with him to avert the evil design of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews.
17´õ 8:4 The king held out the golden scepter to Esther,
17´õ 8:5 and Esther rose and stood before the king. She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have won his favor, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I have his approval, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote giving orders to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.
17´õ 8:6 For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming on my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17´õ 8:7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to the Jew Mordecai, "See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he plotted to lay hands on the Jews.
17´õ 8:8 You may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked."
17´õ 8:9 The king's secretaries were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language.
17´õ 8:10 He wrote letters in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed them with the king's ring, and sent them by mounted couriers riding on fast steeds bred from the royal herd.
17´õ 8:11 By these letters the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, with their children and women, and to plunder their goods
17´õ 8:12 on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
17´õ 8:13 A copy of the writ was to be issued as a decree in every province and published to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take revenge on their enemies.
17´õ 8:14 So the couriers, mounted on their swift royal steeds, hurried out, urged by the king's command. The decree was issued in the citadel of Susa.
17´õ 8:15 Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king, wearing royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a mantle of fine linen and purple, while the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
17´õ 8:16 For the Jews there was light and gladness, joy and honor.
17´õ 8:17 In every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a festival and a holiday. Furthermore, many of the peoples of the country professed to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
17´õ 9:1 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain power over them, but which had been changed to a day when the Jews would gain power over their foes,
17´õ 9:2 the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who had sought their ruin; and no one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.
17´õ 9:3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps and the governors, and the royal officials were supporting the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
17´õ 9:4 For Mordecai was powerful in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful.
17´õ 9:5 So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering, and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.
17´õ 9:6 In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred people.
17´õ 9:7 They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17´õ 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17´õ 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, Vaizatha,
17´õ 9:10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not touch the plunder.
17´õ 9:11 That very day the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king.
17´õ 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, "In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed five hundred people and also the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled."
17´õ 9:13 Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows."
17´õ 9:14 So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
17´õ 9:15 The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed three hundred persons in Susa; but they did not touch the plunder.
17´õ 9:16 Now the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and gained relief from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they laid no hands on the plunder.
17´õ 9:17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.
17´õ 9:18 But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness.
17´õ 9:19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, a holiday on which they send gifts of food to one another.
17´õ 9:20 Mordecai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
17´õ 9:21 enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same month, year by year,
17´õ 9:22 as the days on which the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and presents to the poor.
17´õ 9:23 So the Jews adopted as a custom what they had begun to do, as Mordecai had written to them.
17´õ 9:24 Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur--that is "the lot"--to crush and destroy them;
17´õ 9:25 but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that the wicked plot that he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
17´õ 9:26 Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word Pur. Thus because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them,
17´õ 9:27 the Jews established and accepted as a custom for themselves and their descendants and all who joined them, that without fail they would continue to observe these two days every year, as it was written and at the time appointed.
17´õ 9:28 These days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every family, province, and city; and these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.
17´õ 9:29 Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with the Jew Mordecai, gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.
17´õ 9:30 Letters were sent wishing peace and security to all the Jews, to the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,
17´õ 9:31 and giving orders that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as the Jew Mordecai and Queen Esther enjoined on the Jews, just as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants regulations concerning their fasts and their lamentations.
17´õ 9:32 The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.
17´õ 10:1 King Ahasuerus laid tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea.
17´õ 10:2 All the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?
17´õ 10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and he was powerful among the Jews and popular with his many kindred, for he sought the good of his people and interceded for the welfare of all his descendants.
