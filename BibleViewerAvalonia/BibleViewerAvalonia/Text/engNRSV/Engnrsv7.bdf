44
44青 1:1 In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning
44青 1:2 until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
44青 1:3 After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
44青 1:4 While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. "This," he said, "is what you have heard from me;
44青 1:5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
44青 1:6 So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44青 1:7 He replied, "It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.
44青 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44青 1:9 When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
44青 1:10 While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them.
44青 1:11 They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
44青 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away.
44青 1:13 When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
44青 1:14 All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.
44青 1:15 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said,
44青 1:16 "Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus--
44青 1:17 for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry."
44青 1:18 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.
44青 1:19 This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44青 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it'; and 'Let another take his position of overseer.'
44青 1:21 So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
44青 1:22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection."
44青 1:23 So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
44青 1:24 Then they prayed and said, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen
44青 1:25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
44青 1:26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.
44青 2:1 When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
44青 2:2 And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
44青 2:3 Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them.
44青 2:4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.
44青 2:5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem.
44青 2:6 And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.
44青 2:7 Amazed and astonished, they asked, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
44青 2:8 And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?
44青 2:9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44青 2:10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
44青 2:11 Cretans and Arabs--in our own languages we hear them speaking about God's deeds of power."
44青 2:12 All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
44青 2:13 But others sneered and said, "They are filled with new wine."
44青 2:14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say.
44青 2:15 Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning.
44青 2:16 No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
44青 2:17 'In the last days it will be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
44青 2:18 Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
44青 2:19 And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.
44青 2:20 The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord's great and glorious day.
44青 2:21 Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
44青 2:22 "You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know--
44青 2:23 this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.
44青 2:24 But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.
44青 2:25 For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;
44青 2:26 therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.
44青 2:27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.
44青 2:28 You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
44青 2:29 "Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
44青 2:30 Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.
44青 2:31 Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying, 'He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.'
44青 2:32 This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.
44青 2:33 Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you both see and hear.
44青 2:34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
44青 2:35 until I make your enemies your footstool."'
44青 2:36 Therefore let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified."
44青 2:37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and to the other apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?"
44青 2:38 Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44青 2:39 For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him."
44青 2:40 And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."
44青 2:41 So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.
44青 2:42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.
44青 2:43 Awe came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.
44青 2:44 All who believed were together and had all things in common;
44青 2:45 they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need.
44青 2:46 Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts,
44青 2:47 praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.
44青 3:1 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o'clock in the afternoon.
44青 3:2 And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple.
44青 3:3 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms.
44青 3:4 Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."
44青 3:5 And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
44青 3:6 But Peter said, "I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk."
44青 3:7 And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.
44青 3:8 Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
44青 3:9 All the people saw him walking and praising God,
44青 3:10 and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44青 3:11 While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's Portico, utterly astonished.
44青 3:12 When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, "You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
44青 3:13 The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him.
44青 3:14 But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,
44青 3:15 and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
44青 3:16 And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.
44青 3:17 "And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
44青 3:18 In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer.
44青 3:19 Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out,
44青 3:20 so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus,
44青 3:21 who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets.
44青 3:22 Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you.
44青 3:23 And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.'
44青 3:24 And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days.
44青 3:25 You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, 'And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.'
44青 3:26 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."
44青 4:1 While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them,
44青 4:2 much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead.
44青 4:3 So they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
44青 4:4 But many of those who heard the word believed; and they numbered about five thousand.
44青 4:5 The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem,
44青 4:6 with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
44青 4:7 When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?"
44青 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,
44青 4:9 if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed,
44青 4:10 let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead.
44青 4:11 This Jesus is 'the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.'
44青 4:12 There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved."
44青 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus.
44青 4:14 When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
44青 4:15 So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another.
44青 4:16 They said, "What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.
44青 4:17 But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."
44青 4:18 So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44青 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;
44青 4:20 for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard."
44青 4:21 After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.
44青 4:22 For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
44青 4:23 After they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
44青 4:24 When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them,
44青 4:25 it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant: 'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
44青 4:26 The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers have gathered together against the Lord and against his Messiah.'
44青 4:27 For in this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
44青 4:28 to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
44青 4:29 And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
44青 4:30 while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44青 4:31 When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
44青 4:32 Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common.
44青 4:33 With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
44青 4:34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.
44青 4:35 They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.
44青 4:36 There was a Levite, a native of Cyprus, Joseph, to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement").
44青 4:37 He sold a field that belonged to him, then brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44青 5:1 But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property;
44青 5:2 with his wife's knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44青 5:3 "Ananias," Peter asked, "why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land?
44青 5:4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, were not the proceeds at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You did not lie to us but to God!"
44青 5:5 Now when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard of it.
44青 5:6 The young men came and wrapped up his body, then carried him out and buried him.
44青 5:7 After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44青 5:8 Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price." And she said, "Yes, that was the price."
44青 5:9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
44青 5:10 Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44青 5:11 And great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things.
44青 5:12 Now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
44青 5:13 None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high esteem.
44青 5:14 Yet more than ever believers were added to the Lord, great numbers of both men and women,
44青 5:15 so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mats, in order that Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he came by.
44青 5:16 A great number of people would also gather from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all cured.
44青 5:17 Then the high priest took action; he and all who were with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees), being filled with jealousy,
44青 5:18 arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.
44青 5:19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,
44青 5:20 "Go, stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life."
44青 5:21 When they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching. When the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
44青 5:22 But when the temple police went there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported,
44青 5:23 "We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
44青 5:24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about them, wondering what might be going on.
44青 5:25 Then someone arrived and announced, "Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
44青 5:26 Then the captain went with the temple police and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
44青 5:27 When they had brought them, they had them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them,
44青 5:28 saying, "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man's blood on us."
44青 5:29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than any human authority.
44青 5:30 The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.
44青 5:31 God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
44青 5:32 And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him."
44青 5:33 When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
44青 5:34 But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, respected by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time.
44青 5:35 Then he said to them, "Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.
44青 5:36 For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared.
44青 5:37 After him Judas the Galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
44青 5:38 So in the present case, I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin, it will fail;
44青 5:39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them--in that case you may even be found fighting against God!" They were convinced by him,
44青 5:40 and when they had called in the apostles, they had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
44青 5:41 As they left the council, they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.
44青 5:42 And every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim Jesus as the Messiah.
44青 6:1 Now during those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.
44青 6:2 And the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.
44青 6:3 Therefore, friends, select from among yourselves seven men of good standing, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this task,
44青 6:4 while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word."
44青 6:5 What they said pleased the whole community, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, together with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.
44青 6:6 They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44青 6:7 The word of God continued to spread; the number of the disciples increased greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.
44青 6:8 Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
44青 6:9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and others of those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen.
44青 6:10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
44青 6:11 Then they secretly instigated some men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44青 6:12 They stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes; then they suddenly confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council.
44青 6:13 They set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law;
44青 6:14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed on to us."
44青 6:15 And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44青 7:1 Then the high priest asked him, "Are these things so?"
44青 7:2 And Stephen replied: "Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
44青 7:3 and said to him, 'Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you.'
44青 7:4 Then he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God had him move from there to this country in which you are now living.
44青 7:5 He did not give him any of it as a heritage, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child.
44青 7:6 And God spoke in these terms, that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others, who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years.
44青 7:7 'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'
44青 7:8 Then he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
44青 7:9 "The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him,
44青 7:10 and rescued him from all his afflictions, and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.
44青 7:11 Now there came a famine throughout Egypt and Canaan, and great suffering, and our ancestors could find no food.
44青 7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there on their first visit.
44青 7:13 On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.
44青 7:14 Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five in all;
44青 7:15 so Jacob went down to Egypt. He himself died there as well as our ancestors,
44青 7:16 and their bodies were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
44青 7:17 "But as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, our people in Egypt increased and multiplied
44青 7:18 until another king who had not known Joseph ruled over Egypt.
44青 7:19 He dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die.
44青 7:20 At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful before God. For three months he was brought up in his father's house;
44青 7:21 and when he was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
44青 7:22 So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds.
44青 7:23 "When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his relatives, the Israelites.
44青 7:24 When he saw one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.
44青 7:25 He supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that God through him was rescuing them, but they did not understand.
44青 7:26 The next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?'
44青 7:27 But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
44青 7:28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
44青 7:29 When he heard this, Moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.
44青 7:30 "Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.
44青 7:31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight; and as he approached to look, there came the voice of the Lord:
44青 7:32 'I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look.
44青 7:33 Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44青 7:34 I have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come now, I will send you to Egypt.'
44青 7:35 "It was this Moses whom they rejected when they said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?' and whom God now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44青 7:36 He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
44青 7:37 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up.'
44青 7:38 He is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living oracles to give to us.
44青 7:39 Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him; instead, they pushed him aside, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,
44青 7:40 saying to Aaron, 'Make gods for us who will lead the way for us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
44青 7:41 At that time they made a calf, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and reveled in the works of their hands.
44青 7:42 But God turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
44青 7:43 No; you took along the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; so I will remove you beyond Babylon.'
44青 7:44 "Our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness, as God directed when he spoke to Moses, ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
44青 7:45 Our ancestors in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors. And it was there until the time of David,
44青 7:46 who found favor with God and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.
44青 7:47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
44青 7:48 Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with human hands; as the prophet says,
44青 7:49 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
44青 7:50 Did not my hand make all these things?'
44青 7:51 "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.
44青 7:52 Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.
44青 7:53 You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it."
44青 7:54 When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen.
44青 7:55 But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44青 7:56 "Look," he said, "I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"
44青 7:57 But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him.
44青 7:58 Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44青 7:59 While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44青 7:60 Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he died.
44青 8:1 And Saul approved of their killing him. That day a severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.
44青 8:2 Devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.
44青 8:3 But Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house; dragging off both men and women, he committed them to prison.
44青 8:4 Now those who were scattered went from place to place, proclaiming the word.
44青 8:5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them.
44青 8:6 The crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by Philip, hearing and seeing the signs that he did,
44青 8:7 for unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, came out of many who were possessed; and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured.
44青 8:8 So there was great joy in that city.
44青 8:9 Now a certain man named Simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.
44青 8:10 All of them, from the least to the greatest, listened to him eagerly, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called Great."
44青 8:11 And they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
44青 8:12 But when they believed Philip, who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
44青 8:13 Even Simon himself believed. After being baptized, he stayed constantly with Philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place.
44青 8:14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
44青 8:15 The two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit
44青 8:16 (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus).
44青 8:17 Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44青 8:18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
44青 8:19 saying, "Give me also this power so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
44青 8:20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God's gift with money!
44青 8:21 You have no part or share in this, for your heart is not right before God.
44青 8:22 Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
44青 8:23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness."
44青 8:24 Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me."
44青 8:25 Now after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.
44青 8:26 Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a wilderness road.)
44青 8:27 So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
44青 8:28 and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
44青 8:29 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over to this chariot and join it."
44青 8:30 So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
44青 8:31 He replied, "How can I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.
44青 8:32 Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this: "Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.
44青 8:33 In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."
44青 8:34 The eunuch asked Philip, "About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?"
44青 8:35 Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.
44青 8:36 As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?"
44青 8:37 And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he replied, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."(抄寇)
44青 8:38 He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
44青 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
44青 8:40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
44青 9:1 Meanwhile Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
44青 9:2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
44青 9:3 Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
44青 9:4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
44青 9:5 He asked, "Who are you, Lord?" The reply came, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44青 9:6 But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
44青 9:7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one.
44青 9:8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
44青 9:9 For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
44青 9:10 Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."
44青 9:11 The Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying,
44青 9:12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
44青 9:13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem;
44青 9:14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name."
44青 9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel;
44青 9:16 I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."
44青 9:17 So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44青 9:18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,
44青 9:19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus,
44青 9:20 and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
44青 9:21 All who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem among those who invoked this name? And has he not come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?"
44青 9:22 Saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Messiah.
44青 9:23 After some time had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
44青 9:24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him;
44青 9:25 but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
44青 9:26 When he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
44青 9:27 But Barnabas took him, brought him to the apostles, and described for them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
44青 9:28 So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44青 9:29 He spoke and argued with the Hellenists; but they were attempting to kill him.
44青 9:30 When the believers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44青 9:31 Meanwhile the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and was built up. Living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
44青 9:32 Now as Peter went here and there among all the believers, he came down also to the saints living in Lydda.
44青 9:33 There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, for he was paralyzed.
44青 9:34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed!" And immediately he got up.
44青 9:35 And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44青 9:36 Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity.
44青 9:37 At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs.
44青 9:38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, "Please come to us without delay."
44青 9:39 So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them.
44青 9:40 Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, "Tabitha, get up." Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.
44青 9:41 He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive.
44青 9:42 This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
44青 9:43 Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.
44青 10:1 In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Cohort, as it was called.
44青 10:2 He was a devout man who feared God with all his household; he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to God.
44青 10:3 One afternoon at about three o'clock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of God coming in and saying to him, "Cornelius."
44青 10:4 He stared at him in terror and said, "What is it, Lord?" He answered, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
44青 10:5 Now send men to Joppa for a certain Simon who is called Peter;
44青 10:6 he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
44青 10:7 When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him,
44青 10:8 and after telling them everything, he sent them to Joppa.
44青 10:9 About noon the next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
44青 10:10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44青 10:11 He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners.
44青 10:12 In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air.
44青 10:13 Then he heard a voice saying, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat."
44青 10:14 But Peter said, "By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean."
44青 10:15 The voice said to him again, a second time, "What God has made clean, you must not call profane."
44青 10:16 This happened three times, and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven.
44青 10:17 Now while Peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen, suddenly the men sent by Cornelius appeared. They were asking for Simon's house and were standing by the gate.
44青 10:18 They called out to ask whether Simon, who was called Peter, was staying there.
44青 10:19 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Look, three men are searching for you.
44青 10:20 Now get up, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them."
44青 10:21 So Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?"
44青 10:22 They answered, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say."
44青 10:23 So Peter invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the believers from Joppa accompanied him.
44青 10:24 The following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44青 10:25 On Peter's arrival Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, worshiped him.
44青 10:26 But Peter made him get up, saying, "Stand up; I am only a mortal."
44青 10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found that many had assembled;
44青 10:28 and he said to them, "You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean.
44青 10:29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?"
44青 10:30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago at this very hour, at three o'clock, I was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me.
44青 10:31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
44青 10:32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'
44青 10:33 Therefore I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. So now all of us are here in the presence of God to listen to all that the Lord has commanded you to say."
44青 10:34 Then Peter began to speak to them: "I truly understand that God shows no partiality,
44青 10:35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
44青 10:36 You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all.
44青 10:37 That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced:
44青 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
44青 10:39 We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;
44青 10:40 but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear,
44青 10:41 not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44青 10:42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead.
44青 10:43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
44青 10:44 While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.
44青 10:45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,
44青 10:46 for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said,
44青 10:47 "Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
44青 10:48 So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.
44青 11:1 Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God.
44青 11:2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,
44青 11:3 saying, "Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?"
44青 11:4 Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying,
44青 11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me.
44青 11:6 As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air.
44青 11:7 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'
44青 11:8 But I replied, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44青 11:9 But a second time the voice answered from heaven, 'What God has made clean, you must not call profane.'
44青 11:10 This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven.
44青 11:11 At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were.
44青 11:12 The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
44青 11:13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter;
44青 11:14 he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.'
44青 11:15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning.
44青 11:16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44青 11:17 If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?"
44青 11:18 When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, "Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life."
44青 11:19 Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews.
44青 11:20 But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.
44青 11:21 The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.
44青 11:22 News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44青 11:23 When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion;
44青 11:24 for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord.
44青 11:25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44青 11:26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."
44青 11:27 At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44青 11:28 One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius.
44青 11:29 The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea;
44青 11:30 this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
44青 12:1 About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church.
44青 12:2 He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword.
44青 12:3 After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.)
44青 12:4 When he had seized him, he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
44青 12:5 While Peter was kept in prison, the church prayed fervently to God for him.
44青 12:6 The very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison.
44青 12:7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his wrists.
44青 12:8 The angel said to him, "Fasten your belt and put on your sandals." He did so. Then he said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
44青 12:9 Peter went out and followed him; he did not realize that what was happening with the angel's help was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44青 12:10 After they had passed the first and the second guard, they came before the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went outside and walked along a lane, when suddenly the angel left him.
44青 12:11 Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
44青 12:12 As soon as he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many had gathered and were praying.
44青 12:13 When he knocked at the outer gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.
44青 12:14 On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that, instead of opening the gate, she ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.
44青 12:15 They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."
44青 12:16 Meanwhile Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed.
44青 12:17 He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and described for them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he added, "Tell this to James and to the believers." Then he left and went to another place.
44青 12:18 When morning came, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
44青 12:19 When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then Peter went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
44青 12:20 Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him in a body; and after winning over Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for a reconciliation, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
44青 12:21 On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat on the platform, and delivered a public address to them.
44青 12:22 The people kept shouting, "The voice of a god, and not of a mortal!"
44青 12:23 And immediately, because he had not given the glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44青 12:24 But the word of God continued to advance and gain adherents.
44青 12:25 Then after completing their mission Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John, whose other name was Mark.
44青 13:1 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul.
44青 13:2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44青 13:3 Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
44青 13:4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
44青 13:5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also to assist them.
44青 13:6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they met a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.
44青 13:7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God.
44青 13:8 But the magician Elymas (for that is the translation of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44青 13:9 But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
44青 13:10 and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
44青 13:11 And now listen--the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind for a while, unable to see the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand.
44青 13:12 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
44青 13:13 Then Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem;
44青 13:14 but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
44青 13:15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it."
44青 13:16 So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: "You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen.
44青 13:17 The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
44青 13:18 For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
44青 13:19 After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance
44青 13:20 for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.
44青 13:21 Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.
44青 13:22 When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, 'I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.'
44青 13:23 Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised;
44青 13:24 before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
44青 13:25 And as John was finishing his work, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.'
44青 13:26 "My brothers, you descendants of Abraham's family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.
44青 13:27 Because the residents of Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath, they fulfilled those words by condemning him.
44青 13:28 Even though they found no cause for a sentence of death, they asked Pilate to have him killed.
44青 13:29 When they had carried out everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
44青 13:30 But God raised him from the dead;
44青 13:31 and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are now his witnesses to the people.
44青 13:32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to our ancestors
44青 13:33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you.'
44青 13:34 As to his raising him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, 'I will give you the holy promises made to David.'
44青 13:35 Therefore he has also said in another psalm, 'You will not let your Holy One experience corruption.'
44青 13:36 For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, died, was laid beside his ancestors, and experienced corruption;
44青 13:37 but he whom God raised up experienced no corruption.
44青 13:38 Let it be known to you therefore, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you;
44青 13:39 by this Jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
44青 13:40 Beware, therefore, that what the prophets said does not happen to you:
44青 13:41 'Look, you scoffers! Be amazed and perish, for in your days I am doing a work, a work that you will never believe, even if someone tells you.'"
44青 13:42 As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath.
44青 13:43 When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44青 13:44 The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44青 13:45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy; and blaspheming, they contradicted what was spoken by Paul.
44青 13:46 Then both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life, we are now turning to the Gentiles.
44青 13:47 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, 'I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44青 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord; and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers.
44青 13:49 Thus the word of the Lord spread throughout the region.
44青 13:50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.
44青 13:51 So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them, and went to Iconium.
44青 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44青 14:1 The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks became believers.
44青 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44青 14:3 So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them.
44青 14:4 But the residents of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
44青 14:5 And when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,
44青 14:6 the apostles learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country;
44青 14:7 and there they continued proclaiming the good news.
44青 14:8 In Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked, for he had been crippled from birth.
44青 14:9 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. And Paul, looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
44青 14:10 said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And the man sprang up and began to walk.
44青 14:11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"
44青 14:12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
44青 14:13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates; he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice.
44青 14:14 When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,
44青 14:15 "Friends, why are you doing this? We are mortals just like you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
44青 14:16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways;
44青 14:17 yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing good--giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, and filling you with food and your hearts with joy."
44青 14:18 Even with these words, they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.
44青 14:19 But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. Then they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
44青 14:20 But when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
44青 14:21 After they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, then on to Iconium and Antioch.
44青 14:22 There they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith, saying, "It is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God."
44青 14:23 And after they had appointed elders for them in each church, with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had come to believe.
44青 14:24 Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
44青 14:25 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44青 14:26 From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.
44青 14:27 When they arrived, they called the church together and related all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.
44青 14:28 And they stayed there with the disciples for some time.
44青 15:1 Then certain individuals came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44青 15:2 And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders.
44青 15:3 So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, they reported the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the believers.
44青 15:4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
44青 15:5 But some believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and said, "It is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses."
44青 15:6 The apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter.
44青 15:7 After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "My brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that I should be the one through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers.
44青 15:8 And God, who knows the human heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;
44青 15:9 and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us.
44青 15:10 Now therefore why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?
44青 15:11 On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."
44青 15:12 The whole assembly kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.
44青 15:13 After they finished speaking, James replied, "My brothers, listen to me.
44青 15:14 Simeon has related how God first looked favorably on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name.
44青 15:15 This agrees with the words of the prophets, as it is written,
44青 15:16 'After this I will return, and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; from its ruins I will rebuild it, and I will set it up,
44青 15:17 so that all other peoples may seek the Lord--even all the Gentiles over whom my name has been called. Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things
44青 15:18 known from long ago.'
44青 15:19 Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God,
44青 15:20 but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.
44青 15:21 For in every city, for generations past, Moses has had those who proclaim him, for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues."
44青 15:22 Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brothers,
44青 15:23 with the following letter: "The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the believers of Gentile origin in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.
44青 15:24 Since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us, though with no instructions from us, have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds,
44青 15:25 we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
44青 15:26 who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44青 15:27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.
44青 15:28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials:
44青 15:29 that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell."
44青 15:30 So they were sent off and went down to Antioch. When they gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
44青 15:31 When its members read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation.
44青 15:32 Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.
44青 15:33 After they had been there for some time, they were sent off in peace by the believers to those who had sent them.
44青 15:34 But if seemed good to Silas to remain there.(抄寇)
44青 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, and there, with many others, they taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord.
44青 15:36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Come, let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."
44青 15:37 Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.
44青 15:38 But Paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work.
44青 15:39 The disagreement became so sharp that they parted company; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
44青 15:40 But Paul chose Silas and set out, the believers commending him to the grace of the Lord.
44青 15:41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44青 16:1 Paul went on also to Derbe and to Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
44青 16:2 He was well spoken of by the believers in Lystra and Iconium.
44青 16:3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44青 16:4 As they went from town to town, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
44青 16:5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily.
44青 16:6 They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
44青 16:7 When they had come opposite Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;
44青 16:8 so, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
44青 16:9 During the night Paul had a vision: there stood a man of Macedonia pleading with him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44青 16:10 When he had seen the vision, we immediately tried to cross over to Macedonia, being convinced that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.
44青 16:11 We set sail from Troas and took a straight course to Samothrace, the following day to Neapolis,
44青 16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days.
44青 16:13 On the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there.
44青 16:14 A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul.
44青 16:15 When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home." And she prevailed upon us.
44青 16:16 One day, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling.
44青 16:17 While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation."
44青 16:18 She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
44青 16:19 But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
44青 16:20 When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, "These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews
44青 16:21 and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe."
44青 16:22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
44青 16:23 After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely.
44青 16:24 Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44青 16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
44青 16:26 Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
44青 16:27 When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped.
44青 16:28 But Paul shouted in a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
44青 16:29 The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
44青 16:30 Then he brought them outside and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44青 16:31 They answered, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
44青 16:32 They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
44青 16:33 At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay.
44青 16:34 He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.
44青 16:35 When morning came, the magistrates sent the police, saying, "Let those men go."
44青 16:36 And the jailer reported the message to Paul, saying, "The magistrates sent word to let you go; therefore come out now and go in peace."
44青 16:37 But Paul replied, "They have beaten us in public, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they going to discharge us in secret? Certainly not! Let them come and take us out themselves."
44青 16:38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens;
44青 16:39 so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.
44青 16:40 After leaving the prison they went to Lydia's home; and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there, they departed.
44青 17:1 After Paul and Silas had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
44青 17:2 And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures,
44青 17:3 explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This is the Messiah, Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you."
44青 17:4 Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
44青 17:5 But the Jews became jealous, and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. While they were searching for Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly, they attacked Jason's house.
44青 17:6 When they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some believers before the city authorities, shouting, "These people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also,
44青 17:7 and Jason has entertained them as guests. They are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor, saying that there is another king named Jesus."
44青 17:8 The people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this,
44青 17:9 and after they had taken bail from Jason and the others, they let them go.
44青 17:10 That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and when they arrived, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
44青 17:11 These Jews were more receptive than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so.
44青 17:12 Many of them therefore believed, including not a few Greek women and men of high standing.
44青 17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea as well, they came there too, to stir up and incite the crowds.
44青 17:14 Then the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.
44青 17:15 Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left him.
44青 17:16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
44青 17:17 So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
44青 17:18 Also some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers debated with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities." (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.)
44青 17:19 So they took him and brought him to the Areopagus and asked him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44青 17:20 It sounds rather strange to us, so we would like to know what it means."
44青 17:21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new.
44青 17:22 Then Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, "Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way.
44青 17:23 For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, 'To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
44青 17:24 The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands,
44青 17:25 nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things.
44青 17:26 From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live,
44青 17:27 so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him--though indeed he is not far from each one of us.
44青 17:28 For 'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we too are his offspring.'
44青 17:29 Since we are God's offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals.
44青 17:30 While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
44青 17:31 because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."
44青 17:32 When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; but others said, "We will hear you again about this."
44青 17:33 At that point Paul left them.
44青 17:34 But some of them joined him and became believers, including Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
44青 18:1 After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44青 18:2 There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
44青 18:3 and, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them, and they worked together--by trade they were tentmakers.
44青 18:4 Every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince Jews and Greeks.
44青 18:5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with proclaiming the word, testifying to the Jews that the Messiah was Jesus.
44青 18:6 When they opposed and reviled him, in protest he shook the dust from his clothes and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
44青 18:7 Then he left the synagogue and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God; his house was next door to the synagogue.
44青 18:8 Crispus, the official of the synagogue, became a believer in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul became believers and were baptized.
44青 18:9 One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;
44青 18:10 for I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you, for there are many in this city who are my people."
44青 18:11 He stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
44青 18:12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal.
44青 18:13 They said, "This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law."
44青 18:14 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of crime or serious villainy, I would be justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews;
44青 18:15 but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I do not wish to be a judge of these matters."
44青 18:16 And he dismissed them from the tribunal.
44青 18:17 Then all of them seized Sosthenes, the official of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of these things.
44青 18:18 After staying there for a considerable time, Paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had his hair cut, for he was under a vow.
44青 18:19 When they reached Ephesus, he left them there, but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.
44青 18:20 When they asked him to stay longer, he declined;
44青 18:21 but on taking leave of them, he said, "I will return to you, if God wills." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44青 18:22 When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
44青 18:23 After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44青 18:24 Now there came to Ephesus a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria. He was an eloquent man, well-versed in the scriptures.
44青 18:25 He had been instructed in the Way of the Lord; and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44青 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the Way of God to him more accurately.
44青 18:27 And when he wished to cross over to Achaia, the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers,
44青 18:28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that the Messiah is Jesus.
44青 19:1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the interior regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples.
44青 19:2 He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?" They replied, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44青 19:3 Then he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They answered, "Into John's baptism."
44青 19:4 Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus."
44青 19:5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44青 19:6 When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied--
44青 19:7 altogether there were about twelve of them.
44青 19:8 He entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly, and argued persuasively about the kingdom of God.
44青 19:9 When some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he left them, taking the disciples with him, and argued daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44青 19:10 This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.
44青 19:11 God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
44青 19:12 so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
44青 19:13 Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims."
44青 19:14 Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.
44青 19:15 But the evil spirit said to them in reply, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"
44青 19:16 Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.
44青 19:17 When this became known to all residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, everyone was awestruck; and the name of the Lord Jesus was praised.
44青 19:18 Also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices.
44青 19:19 A number of those who practiced magic collected their books and burned them publicly; when the value of these books was calculated, it was found to come to fifty thousand silver coins.
44青 19:20 So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
44青 19:21 Now after these things had been accomplished, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia, and then to go on to Jerusalem. He said, "After I have gone there, I must also see Rome."
44青 19:22 So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Asia.
44青 19:23 About that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the Way.
44青 19:24 A man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the artisans.
44青 19:25 These he gathered together, with the workers of the same trade, and said, "Men, you know that we get our wealth from this business.
44青 19:26 You also see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost the whole of Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods.
44青 19:27 And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be scorned, and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her."
44青 19:28 When they heard this, they were enraged and shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44青 19:29 The city was filled with the confusion; and people rushed together to the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's travel companions.
44青 19:30 Paul wished to go into the crowd, but the disciples would not let him;
44青 19:31 even some officials of the province of Asia, who were friendly to him, sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater.
44青 19:32 Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
44青 19:33 Some of the crowd gave instructions to Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.
44青 19:34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours all of them shouted in unison, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44青 19:35 But when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Citizens of Ephesus, who is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven?
44青 19:36 Since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
44青 19:37 You have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.
44青 19:38 If therefore Demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges there against one another.
44青 19:39 If there is anything further you want to know, it must be settled in the regular assembly.
44青 19:40 For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion."
44青 19:41 When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
44青 20:1 After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples; and after encouraging them and saying farewell, he left for Macedonia.
44青 20:2 When he had gone through those regions and had given the believers much encouragement, he came to Greece,
44青 20:3 where he stayed for three months. He was about to set sail for Syria when a plot was made against him by the Jews, and so he decided to return through Macedonia.
44青 20:4 He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, by Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, by Gaius from Derbe, and by Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
44青 20:5 They went ahead and were waiting for us in Troas;
44青 20:6 but we sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we joined them in Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
44青 20:7 On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul was holding a discussion with them; since he intended to leave the next day, he continued speaking until midnight.
44青 20:8 There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting.
44青 20:9 A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, began to sink off into a deep sleep while Paul talked still longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up dead.
44青 20:10 But Paul went down, and bending over him took him in his arms, and said, "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him."
44青 20:11 Then Paul went upstairs, and after he had broken bread and eaten, he continued to converse with them until dawn; then he left.
44青 20:12 Meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted.
44青 20:13 We went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for he had made this arrangement, intending to go by land himself.
44青 20:14 When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.
44青 20:15 We sailed from there, and on the following day we arrived opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos, and the day after that we came to Miletus.
44青 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; he was eager to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
44青 20:17 From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus, asking the elders of the church to meet him.
44青 20:18 When they came to him, he said to them: "You yourselves know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,
44青 20:19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, enduring the trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.
44青 20:20 I did not shrink from doing anything helpful, proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house,
44青 20:21 as I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.
44青 20:22 And now, as a captive to the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
44青 20:23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me.
44青 20:24 But I do not count my life of any value to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of God's grace.
44青 20:25 "And now I know that none of you, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will ever see my face again.
44青 20:26 Therefore I declare to you this day that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,
44青 20:27 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
44青 20:28 Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son.
44青 20:29 I know that after I have gone, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
44青 20:30 Some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them.
44青 20:31 Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears.
44青 20:32 And now I commend you to God and to the message of his grace, a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified.
44青 20:33 I coveted no one's silver or gold or clothing.
44青 20:34 You know for yourselves that I worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions.
44青 20:35 In all this I have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, for he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44青 20:36 When he had finished speaking, he knelt down with them all and prayed.
44青 20:37 There was much weeping among them all; they embraced Paul and kissed him,
44青 20:38 grieving especially because of what he had said, that they would not see him again. Then they brought him to the ship.
44青 21:1 When we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
44青 21:2 When we found a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.
44青 21:3 We came in sight of Cyprus; and leaving it on our left, we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.
44青 21:4 We looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
44青 21:5 When our days there were ended, we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them, with wives and children, escorted us outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed
44青 21:6 and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
44青 21:7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day.
44青 21:8 The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.
44青 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.
44青 21:10 While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44青 21:11 He came to us and took Paul's belt, bound his own feet and hands with it, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"
44青 21:12 When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
44青 21:13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44青 21:14 Since he would not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, "The Lord's will be done."
44青 21:15 After these days we got ready and started to go up to Jerusalem.
44青 21:16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.
44青 21:17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly.
44青 21:18 The next day Paul went with us to visit James; and all the elders were present.
44青 21:19 After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44青 21:20 When they heard it, they praised God. Then they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.
44青 21:21 They have been told about you that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.
44青 21:22 What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44青 21:23 So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.
44青 21:24 Join these men, go through the rite of purification with them, and pay for the shaving of their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself observe and guard the law.
44青 21:25 But as for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication."
44青 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having purified himself, he entered the temple with them, making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them.
44青 21:27 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who had seen him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd. They seized him,
44青 21:28 shouting, "Fellow Israelites, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place; more than that, he has actually brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
44青 21:29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
44青 21:30 Then all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.
44青 21:31 While they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44青 21:32 Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44青 21:33 Then the tribune came, arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; he inquired who he was and what he had done.
44青 21:34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
44青 21:35 When Paul came to the steps, the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers.
44青 21:36 The crowd that followed kept shouting, "Away with him!"
44青 21:37 Just as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, "May I say something to you?" The tribune replied, "Do you know Greek?
44青 21:38 Then you are not the Egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?"
44青 21:39 Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city; I beg you, let me speak to the people."
44青 21:40 When he had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence; and when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
44青 22:1 "Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I now make before you."
44青 22:2 When they heard him addressing them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet. Then he said:
44青 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated strictly according to our ancestral law, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.
44青 22:4 I persecuted this Way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison,
44青 22:5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to Jerusalem for punishment.
44青 22:6 "While I was on my way and approaching Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me.
44青 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
44青 22:8 I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' Then he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.'
44青 22:9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
44青 22:10 I asked, 'What am I to do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Get up and go to Damascus; there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do.'
44青 22:11 Since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, those who were with me took my hand and led me to Damascus.
44青 22:12 "A certain Ananias, who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews living there,
44青 22:13 came to me; and standing beside me, he said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight!' In that very hour I regained my sight and saw him.
44青 22:14 Then he said, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear his own voice;
44青 22:15 for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard.
44青 22:16 And now why do you delay? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away, calling on his name.'
44青 22:17 "After I had returned to Jerusalem and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
44青 22:18 and saw Jesus saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
44青 22:19 And I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
44青 22:20 And while the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing by, approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him.'
44青 22:21 Then he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44青 22:22 Up to this point they listened to him, but then they shouted, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live."
44青 22:23 And while they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and tossing dust into the air,
44青 22:24 the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by flogging, to find out the reason for this outcry against him.
44青 22:25 But when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who is uncondemned?"
44青 22:26 When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen."
44青 22:27 The tribune came and asked Paul, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."
44青 22:28 The tribune answered, "It cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship." Paul said, "But I was born a citizen."
44青 22:29 Immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.
44青 22:30 Since he wanted to find out what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet. He brought Paul down and had him stand before them.
44青 23:1 While Paul was looking intently at the council he said, "Brothers, up to this day I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God."
44青 23:2 Then the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth.
44青 23:3 At this Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me according to the law, and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck?"
44青 23:4 Those standing nearby said, "Do you dare to insult God's high priest?"
44青 23:5 And Paul said, "I did not realize, brothers, that he was high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a leader of your people.'"
44青 23:6 When Paul noticed that some were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he called out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead."
44青 23:7 When he said this, a dissension began between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44青 23:8 (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge all three.)
44青 23:9 Then a great clamor arose, and certain scribes of the Pharisees' group stood up and contended, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44青 23:10 When the dissension became violent, the tribune, fearing that they would tear Paul to pieces, ordered the soldiers to go down, take him by force, and bring him into the barracks.
44青 23:11 That night the Lord stood near him and said, "Keep up your courage! For just as you have testified for me in Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also in Rome."
44青 23:12 In the morning the Jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
44青 23:13 There were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy.
44青 23:14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed Paul.
44青 23:15 Now then, you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you, on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case. And we are ready to do away with him before he arrives."
44青 23:16 Now the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush; so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told Paul.
44青 23:17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to report to him."
44青 23:18 So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you; he has something to tell you."
44青 23:19 The tribune took him by the hand, drew him aside privately, and asked, "What is it that you have to report to me?"
44青 23:20 He answered, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case.
44青 23:21 But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him. They are ready now and are waiting for your consent."
44青 23:22 So the tribune dismissed the young man, ordering him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of this."
44青 23:23 Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, "Get ready to leave by nine o'clock tonight for Caesarea with two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen.
44青 23:24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Felix the governor."
44青 23:25 He wrote a letter to this effect:
44青 23:26 "Claudius Lysias to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.
44青 23:27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but when I had learned that he was a Roman citizen, I came with the guard and rescued him.
44青 23:28 Since I wanted to know the charge for which they accused him, I had him brought to their council.
44青 23:29 I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.
44青 23:30 When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him."
44青 23:31 So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him during the night to Antipatris.
44青 23:32 The next day they let the horsemen go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
44青 23:33 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
44青 23:34 On reading the letter, he asked what province he belonged to, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
44青 23:35 he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive." Then he ordered that he be kept under guard in Herod's headquarters.
44青 24:1 Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, and they reported their case against Paul to the governor.
44青 24:2 When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: "Your Excellency, because of you we have long enjoyed peace, and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight.
44青 24:3 We welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude.
44青 24:4 But, to detain you no further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.
44青 24:5 We have, in fact, found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
44青 24:6 He even tried to profane the temple, and so we seized him.
44青 24:7 And we would have judged him according to our law. [7]But the chief captain Lysias came and with great violence took him out of our hands, [8]commanding his accusers to come before you.(抄寇)
44青 24:8 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him."
44青 24:9 The Jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true.
44青 24:10 When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied: "I cheerfully make my defense, knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation.
44青 24:11 As you can find out, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
44青 24:12 They did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city.
44青 24:13 Neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me.
44青 24:14 But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our ancestors, believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets.
44青 24:15 I have a hope in God--a hope that they themselves also accept--that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.
44青 24:16 Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience toward God and all people.
44青 24:17 Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices.
44青 24:18 While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, completing the rite of purification, without any crowd or disturbance.
44青 24:19 But there were some Jews from Asia--they ought to be here before you to make an accusation, if they have anything against me.
44青 24:20 Or let these men here tell what crime they had found when I stood before the council,
44青 24:21 unless it was this one sentence that I called out while standing before them, 'It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"
44青 24:22 But Felix, who was rather well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing with the comment, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."
44青 24:23 Then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody, but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs.
44青 24:24 Some days later when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak concerning faith in Christ Jesus.
44青 24:25 And as he discussed justice, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity, I will send for you."
44青 24:26 At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul, and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him.
44青 24:27 After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and since he wanted to grant the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
44青 25:1 Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem
44青 25:2 where the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews gave him a report against Paul. They appealed to him
44青 25:3 and requested, as a favor to them against Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem. They were, in fact, planning an ambush to kill him along the way.
44青 25:4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.
44青 25:5 "So," he said, "let those of you who have the authority come down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him."
44青 25:6 After he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
44青 25:7 When he arrived, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem surrounded him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.
44青 25:8 Paul said in his defense, "I have in no way committed an offense against the law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against the emperor."
44青 25:9 But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges?"
44青 25:10 Paul said, "I am appealing to the emperor's tribunal; this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.
44青 25:11 Now if I am in the wrong and have committed something for which I deserve to die, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to the emperor."
44青 25:12 Then Festus, after he had conferred with his council, replied, "You have appealed to the emperor; to the emperor you will go."
44青 25:13 After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus.
44青 25:14 Since they were staying there several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.
44青 25:15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him.
44青 25:16 I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge.
44青 25:17 So when they met here, I lost no time, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.
44青 25:18 When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the crimes that I was expecting.
44青 25:19 Instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.
44青 25:20 Since I was at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges.
44青 25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his Imperial Majesty, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to the emperor."
44青 25:22 Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him."
44青 25:23 So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then Festus gave the order and Paul was brought in.
44青 25:24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish community petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
44青 25:25 But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and when he appealed to his Imperial Majesty, I decided to send him.
44青 25:26 But I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write--
44青 25:27 for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him."
44青 26:1 Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself:
44青 26:2 "I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,
44青 26:3 because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg of you to listen to me patiently.
44青 26:4 "All the Jews know my way of life from my youth, a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem.
44青 26:5 They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a Pharisee.
44青 26:6 And now I stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors,
44青 26:7 a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship day and night. It is for this hope, your Excellency, that I am accused by Jews!
44青 26:8 Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
44青 26:9 "Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44青 26:10 And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death.
44青 26:11 By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.
44青 26:12 "With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
44青 26:13 when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions.
44青 26:14 When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.'
44青 26:15 I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord answered, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
44青 26:16 But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you.
44青 26:17 I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles--to whom I am sending you
44青 26:18 to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
44青 26:19 "After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
44青 26:20 but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance.
44青 26:21 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
44青 26:22 To this day I have had help from God, and so I stand here, testifying to both small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would take place:
44青 26:23 that the Messiah must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."
44青 26:24 While he was making this defense, Festus exclaimed, "You are out of your mind, Paul! Too much learning is driving you insane!"
44青 26:25 But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.
44青 26:26 Indeed the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.
44青 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
44青 26:28 Agrippa said to Paul, "Are you so quickly persuading me to become a Christian?"
44青 26:29 Paul replied, "Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as I am--except for these chains."
44青 26:30 Then the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those who had been seated with them;
44青 26:31 and as they were leaving, they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment."
44青 26:32 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor."
44青 27:1 When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, they transferred Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort, named Julius.
44青 27:2 Embarking on a ship of Adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
44青 27:3 The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for.
44青 27:4 Putting out to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.
44青 27:5 After we had sailed across the sea that is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
44青 27:6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board.
44青 27:7 We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind was against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.
44青 27:8 Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
44青 27:9 Since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous, because even the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,
44青 27:10 saying, "Sirs, I can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44青 27:11 But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
44青 27:12 Since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter, the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, where they could spend the winter. It was a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest.
44青 27:13 When a moderate south wind began to blow, they thought they could achieve their purpose; so they weighed anchor and began to sail past Crete, close to the shore.
44青 27:14 But soon a violent wind, called the northeaster, rushed down from Crete.
44青 27:15 Since the ship was caught and could not be turned head-on into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.
44青 27:16 By running under the lee of a small island called Cauda we were scarcely able to get the ship's boat under control.
44青 27:17 After hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they would run on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven.
44青 27:18 We were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard,
44青 27:19 and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ship's tackle overboard.
44青 27:20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest raged, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
44青 27:21 Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul then stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss.
44青 27:22 I urge you now to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
44青 27:23 For last night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,
44青 27:24 and he said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before the emperor; and indeed, God has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you.'
44青 27:25 So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.
44青 27:26 But we will have to run aground on some island."
44青 27:27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.
44青 27:28 So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms.
44青 27:29 Fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
44青 27:30 But when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea, on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow,
44青 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44青 27:32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift.
44青 27:33 Just before daybreak, Paul urged all of them to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food, having eaten nothing.
44青 27:34 Therefore I urge you to take some food, for it will help you survive; for none of you will lose a hair from your heads."
44青 27:35 After he had said this, he took bread; and giving thanks to God in the presence of all, he broke it and began to eat.
44青 27:36 Then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves.
44青 27:37 (We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons in the ship.)
44青 27:38 After they had satisfied their hunger, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.
44青 27:39 In the morning they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned to run the ship ashore, if they could.
44青 27:40 So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea. At the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steering-oars; then hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
44青 27:41 But striking a reef, they ran the ship aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.
44青 27:42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none might swim away and escape;
44青 27:43 but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,
44青 27:44 and the rest to follow, some on planks and others on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.
44青 28:1 After we had reached safety, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
44青 28:2 The natives showed us unusual kindness. Since it had begun to rain and was cold, they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us around it.
44青 28:3 Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire, when a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.
44青 28:4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "This man must be a murderer; though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
44青 28:5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
44青 28:6 They were expecting him to swell up or drop dead, but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.
44青 28:7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
44青 28:8 It so happened that the father of Publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery. Paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him.
44青 28:9 After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
44青 28:10 They bestowed many honors on us, and when we were about to sail, they put on board all the provisions we needed.
44青 28:11 Three months later we set sail on a ship that had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian ship with the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.
44青 28:12 We put in at Syracuse and stayed there for three days;
44青 28:13 then we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. After one day there a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
44青 28:14 There we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
44青 28:15 The believers from there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.
44青 28:16 When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
44青 28:17 Three days later he called together the local leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them, "Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, yet I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44青 28:18 When they had examined me, the Romans wanted to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
44青 28:19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to the emperor--even though I had no charge to bring against my nation.
44青 28:20 For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."
44青 28:21 They replied, "We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you.
44青 28:22 But we would like to hear from you what you think, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against."
44青 28:23 After they had set a day to meet with him, they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers. From morning until evening he explained the matter to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.
44青 28:24 Some were convinced by what he had said, while others refused to believe.
44青 28:25 So they disagreed with each other; and as they were leaving, Paul made one further statement: "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah,
44青 28:26 'Go to this people and say, You will indeed listen, but never understand, and you will indeed look, but never perceive.
44青 28:27 For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn--and I would heal them.'
44青 28:28 Let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen."
44青 28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, arguing vigorously among themselves.(抄寇)
44青 28:30 He lived there two whole years at his own expense and welcomed all who came to him,
44青 28:31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
45
45芬 1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
45芬 1:2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
45芬 1:3 the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh
45芬 1:4 and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
45芬 1:5 through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name,
45芬 1:6 including yourselves who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,
45芬 1:7 To all God's beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45芬 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the world.
45芬 1:9 For God, whom I serve with my spirit by announcing the gospel of his Son, is my witness that without ceasing I remember you always in my prayers,
45芬 1:10 asking that by God's will I may somehow at last succeed in coming to you.
45芬 1:11 For I am longing to see you so that I may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you--
45芬 1:12 or rather so that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
45芬 1:13 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.
45芬 1:14 I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish
45芬 1:15 --hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
45芬 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel; it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
45芬 1:17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, "The one who is righteous will live by faith."
45芬 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth.
45芬 1:19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
45芬 1:20 Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made. So they are without excuse;
45芬 1:21 for though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their senseless minds were darkened.
45芬 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools;
45芬 1:23 and they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles.
45芬 1:24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves,
45芬 1:25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
45芬 1:26 For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural,
45芬 1:27 and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.
45芬 1:28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done.
45芬 1:29 They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips,
45芬 1:30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious toward parents,
45芬 1:31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
45芬 1:32 They know God's decree, that those who practice such things deserve to die--yet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them.
45芬 2:1 Therefore you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.
45芬 2:2 You say, "We know that God's judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth."
45芬 2:3 Do you imagine, whoever you are, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?
45芬 2:4 Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not realize that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
45芬 2:5 But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
45芬 2:6 For he will repay according to each one's deeds:
45芬 2:7 to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;
45芬 2:8 while for those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.
45芬 2:9 There will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,
45芬 2:10 but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.
45芬 2:11 For God shows no partiality.
45芬 2:12 All who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
45芬 2:13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God's sight, but the doers of the law who will be justified.
45芬 2:14 When Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, these, though not having the law, are a law to themselves.
45芬 2:15 They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness; and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them
45芬 2:16 on the day when, according to my gospel, God, through Jesus Christ, will judge the secret thoughts of all.
45芬 2:17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God
45芬 2:18 and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law,
45芬 2:19 and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
45芬 2:20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,
45芬 2:21 you, then, that teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?
45芬 2:22 You that forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You that abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45芬 2:23 You that boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45芬 2:24 For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
45芬 2:25 Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
45芬 2:26 So, if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
45芬 2:27 Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law.
45芬 2:28 For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.
45芬 2:29 Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart--it is spiritual and not literal. Such a person receives praise not from others but from God.
45芬 3:1 Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
45芬 3:2 Much, in every way. For in the first place the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.
45芬 3:3 What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
45芬 3:4 By no means! Although everyone is a liar, let God be proved true, as it is written, "So that you may be justified in your words, and prevail in your judging."
45芬 3:5 But if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of God, what should we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)
45芬 3:6 By no means! For then how could God judge the world?
45芬 3:7 But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
45芬 3:8 And why not say (as some people slander us by saying that we say), "Let us do evil so that good may come"? Their condemnation is deserved!
45芬 3:9 What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all; for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin,
45芬 3:10 as it is written: "There is no one who is righteous, not even one;
45芬 3:11 there is no one who has understanding, there is no one who seeks God.
45芬 3:12 All have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, there is not even one."
45芬 3:13 "Their throats are opened graves; they use their tongues to deceive." "The venom of vipers is under their lips."
45芬 3:14 "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
45芬 3:15 "Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45芬 3:16 ruin and misery are in their paths,
45芬 3:17 and the way of peace they have not known."
45芬 3:18 "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45芬 3:19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
45芬 3:20 For "no human being will be justified in his sight" by deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
45芬 3:21 But now, apart from law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed, and is attested by the law and the prophets,
45芬 3:22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,
45芬 3:23 since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;
45芬 3:24 they are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
45芬 3:25 whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood, effective through faith. He did this to show his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed;
45芬 3:26 it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in Jesus.
45芬 3:27 Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works? No, but by the law of faith.
45芬 3:28 For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law.
45芬 3:29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
45芬 3:30 since God is one; and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
45芬 3:31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
45芬 4:1 What then are we to say was gained by Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh?
45芬 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
45芬 4:3 For what does the scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."
45芬 4:4 Now to one who works, wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due.
45芬 4:5 But to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly, such faith is reckoned as righteousness.
45芬 4:6 So also David speaks of the blessedness of those to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:
45芬 4:7 "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
45芬 4:8 blessed is the one against whom the Lord will not reckon sin."
45芬 4:9 Is this blessedness, then, pronounced only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We say, "Faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness."
45芬 4:10 How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
45芬 4:11 He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them,
45芬 4:12 and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45芬 4:13 For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith.
45芬 4:14 If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.
45芬 4:15 For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.
45芬 4:16 For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us,
45芬 4:17 as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations")--in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
45芬 4:18 Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become "the father of many nations," according to what was said, "So numerous shall your descendants be."
45芬 4:19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.
45芬 4:20 No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,
45芬 4:21 being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
45芬 4:22 Therefore his faith "was reckoned to him as righteousness."
45芬 4:23 Now the words, "it was reckoned to him," were written not for his sake alone,
45芬 4:24 but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
45芬 4:25 who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.
45芬 5:1 Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
45芬 5:2 through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God.
45芬 5:3 And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
45芬 5:4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,
45芬 5:5 and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.
45芬 5:6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
45芬 5:7 Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person--though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die.
45芬 5:8 But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us.
45芬 5:9 Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.
45芬 5:10 For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life.
45芬 5:11 But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45芬 5:12 Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned--
45芬 5:13 sin was indeed in the world before the law, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law.
45芬 5:14 Yet death exercised dominion from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who was to come.
45芬 5:15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died through the one man's trespass, much more surely have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for the many.
45芬 5:16 And the free gift is not like the effect of the one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification.
45芬 5:17 If, because of the one man's trespass, death exercised dominion through that one, much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
45芬 5:18 Therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man's act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all.
45芬 5:19 For just as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.
45芬 5:20 But law came in, with the result that the trespass multiplied; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
45芬 5:21 so that, just as sin exercised dominion in death, so grace might also exercise dominion through justification leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45芬 6:1 What then are we to say? Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound?
45芬 6:2 By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it?
45芬 6:3 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45芬 6:4 Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.
45芬 6:5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45芬 6:6 We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.
45芬 6:7 For whoever has died is freed from sin.
45芬 6:8 But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45芬 6:9 We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.
45芬 6:10 The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
45芬 6:11 So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45芬 6:12 Therefore, do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.
45芬 6:13 No longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and present your members to God as instruments of righteousness.
45芬 6:14 For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
45芬 6:15 What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
45芬 6:16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45芬 6:17 But thanks be to God that you, having once been slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted,
45芬 6:18 and that you, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.
45芬 6:19 I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.
45芬 6:20 When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
45芬 6:21 So what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed? The end of those things is death.
45芬 6:22 But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the advantage you get is sanctification. The end is eternal life.
45芬 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45芬 7:1 Do you not know, brothers and sisters--for I am speaking to those who know the law--that the law is binding on a person only during that person's lifetime?
45芬 7:2 Thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law concerning the husband.
45芬 7:3 Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.
45芬 7:4 In the same way, my friends, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.
45芬 7:5 While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.
45芬 7:6 But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.
45芬 7:7 What then should we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."
45芬 7:8 But sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead.
45芬 7:9 I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived
45芬 7:10 and I died, and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.
45芬 7:11 For sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
45芬 7:12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.
45芬 7:13 Did what is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
45芬 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am of the flesh, sold into slavery under sin.
45芬 7:15 I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.
45芬 7:16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good.
45芬 7:17 But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.
45芬 7:18 For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it.
45芬 7:19 For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.
45芬 7:20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.
45芬 7:21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand.
45芬 7:22 For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self,
45芬 7:23 but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
45芬 7:24 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
45芬 7:25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I am a slave to the law of God, but with my flesh I am a slave to the law of sin.
45芬 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
45芬 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
45芬 8:3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,
45芬 8:4 so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45芬 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
45芬 8:6 To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
45芬 8:7 For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law--indeed it cannot,
45芬 8:8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
45芬 8:9 But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.
45芬 8:10 But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
45芬 8:11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.
45芬 8:12 So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh--
45芬 8:13 for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
45芬 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
45芬 8:15 For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, "Abba! Father!"
45芬 8:16 it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
45芬 8:17 and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ--if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
45芬 8:18 I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us.
45芬 8:19 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God;
45芬 8:20 for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
45芬 8:21 that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
45芬 8:22 We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now;
45芬 8:23 and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
45芬 8:24 For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen?
45芬 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
45芬 8:26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.
45芬 8:27 And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
45芬 8:28 We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.
45芬 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family.
45芬 8:30 And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.
45芬 8:31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
45芬 8:32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?
45芬 8:33 Who will bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
45芬 8:34 Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.
45芬 8:35 Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
45芬 8:36 As it is written, "For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered."
45芬 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45芬 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
45芬 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45芬 9:1 I am speaking the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience confirms it by the Holy Spirit--
45芬 9:2 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
45芬 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people, my kindred according to the flesh.
45芬 9:4 They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;
45芬 9:5 to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
45芬 9:6 It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,
45芬 9:7 and not all of Abraham's children are his true descendants; but "It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you."
45芬 9:8 This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.
45芬 9:9 For this is what the promise said, "About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son."
45芬 9:10 Nor is that all; something similar happened to Rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband, our ancestor Isaac.
45芬 9:11 Even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's purpose of election might continue,
45芬 9:12 not by works but by his call) she was told, "The elder shall serve the younger."
45芬 9:13 As it is written, "I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau."
45芬 9:14 What then are we to say? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!
45芬 9:15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45芬 9:16 So it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.
45芬 9:17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "I have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth."
45芬 9:18 So then he has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.
45芬 9:19 You will say to me then, "Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"
45芬 9:20 But who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God? Will what is molded say to the one who molds it, "Why have you made me like this?"
45芬 9:21 Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use?
45芬 9:22 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction;
45芬 9:23 and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory--
45芬 9:24 including us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
45芬 9:25 As indeed he says in Hosea, "Those who were not my people I will call 'my people,' and her who was not beloved I will call 'beloved.'"
45芬 9:26 "And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they shall be called children of the living God."
45芬 9:27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "Though the number of the children of Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved;
45芬 9:28 for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively."
45芬 9:29 And as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of hosts had not left survivors to us, we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah."
45芬 9:30 What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;
45芬 9:31 but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.
45芬 9:32 Why not? Because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,
45芬 9:33 as it is written, "See, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
45芬 10:1 Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
45芬 10:2 I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened.
45芬 10:3 For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God's righteousness.
45芬 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
45芬 10:5 Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that "the person who does these things will live by them."
45芬 10:6 But the righteousness that comes from faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)
45芬 10:7 "or 'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
45芬 10:8 But what does it say? "The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
45芬 10:9 because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45芬 10:10 For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.
45芬 10:11 The scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to shame."
45芬 10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him.
45芬 10:13 For, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
45芬 10:14 But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him?
45芬 10:15 And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
45芬 10:16 But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
45芬 10:17 So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.
45芬 10:18 But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for "Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."
45芬 10:19 Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."
45芬 10:20 Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
45芬 10:21 But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
45芬 11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
45芬 11:2 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
45芬 11:3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life."
45芬 11:4 But what is the divine reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
45芬 11:5 So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
45芬 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
45芬 11:7 What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
45芬 11:8 as it is written, "God gave them a sluggish spirit, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day."
45芬 11:9 And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;
45芬 11:10 let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent."
45芬 11:11 So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
45芬 11:12 Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
45芬 11:13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry
45芬 11:14 in order to make my own people jealous, and thus save some of them.
45芬 11:15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead!
45芬 11:16 If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; and if the root is holy, then the branches also are holy.
45芬 11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,
45芬 11:18 do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.
45芬 11:19 You will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
45芬 11:20 That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.
45芬 11:21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.
45芬 11:22 Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
45芬 11:23 And even those of Israel, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
45芬 11:24 For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.
45芬 11:25 So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
45芬 11:26 And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, "Out of Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob."
45芬 11:27 "And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins."
45芬 11:28 As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors;
45芬 11:29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
45芬 11:30 Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,
45芬 11:31 so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.
45芬 11:32 For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.
45芬 11:33 O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
45芬 11:34 "For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"
45芬 11:35 "Or who has given a gift to him, to receive a gift in return?"
45芬 11:36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.
45芬 12:1 I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
45芬 12:2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God--what is good and acceptable and perfect.
45芬 12:3 For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
45芬 12:4 For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function,
45芬 12:5 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another.
45芬 12:6 We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith;
45芬 12:7 ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching;
45芬 12:8 the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.
45芬 12:9 Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good;
45芬 12:10 love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor.
45芬 12:11 Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord.
45芬 12:12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer.
45芬 12:13 Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.
45芬 12:14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
45芬 12:15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
45芬 12:16 Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are.
45芬 12:17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.
45芬 12:18 If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
45芬 12:19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
45芬 12:20 No, "if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads."
45芬 12:21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45芬 13:1 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God.
45芬 13:2 Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
45芬 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive its approval;
45芬 13:4 for it is God's servant for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for the authority does not bear the sword in vain! It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.
45芬 13:5 Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.
45芬 13:6 For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, busy with this very thing.
45芬 13:7 Pay to all what is due them--taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.
45芬 13:8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
45芬 13:9 The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not covet"; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
45芬 13:10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.
45芬 13:11 Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers;
45芬 13:12 the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light;
45芬 13:13 let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.
45芬 13:14 Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.
45芬 14:1 Welcome those who are weak in faith, but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions.
45芬 14:2 Some believe in eating anything, while the weak eat only vegetables.
45芬 14:3 Those who eat must not despise those who abstain, and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat; for God has welcomed them.
45芬 14:4 Who are you to pass judgment on servants of another? It is before their own lord that they stand or fall. And they will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
45芬 14:5 Some judge one day to be better than another, while others judge all days to be alike. Let all be fully convinced in their own minds.
45芬 14:6 Those who observe the day, observe it in honor of the Lord. Also those who eat, eat in honor of the Lord, since they give thanks to God; while those who abstain, abstain in honor of the Lord and give thanks to God.
45芬 14:7 We do not live to ourselves, and we do not die to ourselves.
45芬 14:8 If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
45芬 14:9 For to this end Christ died and lived again, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
45芬 14:10 Why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
45芬 14:11 For it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God."
45芬 14:12 So then, each of us will be accountable to God.
45芬 14:13 Let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another, but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another.
45芬 14:14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.
45芬 14:15 If your brother or sister is being injured by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died.
45芬 14:16 So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.
45芬 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45芬 14:18 The one who thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and has human approval.
45芬 14:19 Let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
45芬 14:20 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for you to make others fall by what you eat;
45芬 14:21 it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother or sister stumble.
45芬 14:22 The faith that you have, have as your own conviction before God. Blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve.
45芬 14:23 But those who have doubts are condemned if they eat, because they do not act from faith; for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
45芬 15:1 We who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
45芬 15:2 Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor.
45芬 15:3 For Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me."
45芬 15:4 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.
45芬 15:5 May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,
45芬 15:6 so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45芬 15:7 Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
45芬 15:8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,
45芬 15:9 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name";
45芬 15:10 and again he says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people";
45芬 15:11 and again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him";
45芬 15:12 and again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope."
45芬 15:13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45芬 15:14 I myself feel confident about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.
45芬 15:15 Nevertheless on some points I have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God
45芬 15:16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45芬 15:17 In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast of my work for God.
45芬 15:18 For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed,
45芬 15:19 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far around as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ.
45芬 15:20 Thus I make it my ambition to proclaim the good news, not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on someone else's foundation,
45芬 15:21 but as it is written, "Those who have never been told of him shall see, and those who have never heard of him shall understand."
45芬 15:22 This is the reason that I have so often been hindered from coming to you.
45芬 15:23 But now, with no further place for me in these regions, I desire, as I have for many years, to come to you
45芬 15:24 when I go to Spain. For I do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a little while.
45芬 15:25 At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem in a ministry to the saints;
45芬 15:26 for Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.
45芬 15:27 They were pleased to do this, and indeed they owe it to them; for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material things.
45芬 15:28 So, when I have completed this, and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will set out by way of you to Spain;
45芬 15:29 and I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
45芬 15:30 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf,
45芬 15:31 that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
45芬 15:32 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.
45芬 15:33 The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.
45芬 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church at Cenchreae,
45芬 16:2 so that you may welcome her in the Lord as is fitting for the saints, and help her in whatever she may require from you, for she has been a benefactor of many and of myself as well.
45芬 16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, who work with me in Christ Jesus,
45芬 16:4 and who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
45芬 16:5 Greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert in Asia for Christ.
45芬 16:6 Greet Mary, who has worked very hard among you.
45芬 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives who were in prison with me; they are prominent among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
45芬 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
45芬 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.
45芬 16:10 Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
45芬 16:11 Greet my relative Herodion. Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus.
45芬 16:12 Greet those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.
45芬 16:13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord; and greet his mother--a mother to me also.
45芬 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters who are with them.
45芬 16:15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
45芬 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
45芬 16:17 I urge you, brothers and sisters, to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses, in opposition to the teaching that you have learned; avoid them.
45芬 16:18 For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the simple-minded.
45芬 16:19 For while your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, I want you to be wise in what is good and guileless in what is evil.
45芬 16:20 The God of peace will shortly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
45芬 16:21 Timothy, my co-worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.
45芬 16:22 I Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45芬 16:23 Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus, greet you.
45芬 16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.(抄寇)
45芬 16:25 Now to God who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages
45芬 16:26 but is now disclosed, and through the prophetic writings is made known to all the Gentiles, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith--
45芬 16:27 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.

46绊傈 1:1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
46绊傈 1:2 To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
46绊傈 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
46绊傈 1:4 I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus,
46绊傈 1:5 for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind--
46绊傈 1:6 just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you--
46绊傈 1:7 so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46绊傈 1:8 He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46绊傈 1:9 God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
46绊傈 1:10 Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose.
46绊傈 1:11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters.
46绊傈 1:12 What I mean is that each of you says, "I belong to Paul," or "I belong to Apollos," or "I belong to Cephas," or "I belong to Christ."
46绊傈 1:13 Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
46绊傈 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
46绊傈 1:15 so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
46绊傈 1:16 (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
46绊傈 1:17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.
46绊傈 1:18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
46绊傈 1:19 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart."
46绊傈 1:20 Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
46绊傈 1:21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe.
46绊傈 1:22 For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom,
46绊傈 1:23 but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
46绊傈 1:24 but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
46绊傈 1:25 For God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.
46绊傈 1:26 Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
46绊傈 1:27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
46绊傈 1:28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are,
46绊傈 1:29 so that no one might boast in the presence of God.
46绊傈 1:30 He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
46绊傈 1:31 in order that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
46绊傈 2:1 When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom.
46绊傈 2:2 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
46绊傈 2:3 And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
46绊傈 2:4 My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
46绊傈 2:5 so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.
46绊傈 2:6 Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish.
46绊傈 2:7 But we speak God's wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
46绊傈 2:8 None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
46绊傈 2:9 But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him"--
46绊傈 2:10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
46绊傈 2:11 For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God's except the Spirit of God.
46绊傈 2:12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.
46绊傈 2:13 And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.
46绊傈 2:14 Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
46绊傈 2:15 Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else's scrutiny.
46绊傈 2:16 "For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
46绊傈 3:1 And so, brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but rather as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
46绊傈 3:2 I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for solid food. Even now you are still not ready,
46绊傈 3:3 for you are still of the flesh. For as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving according to human inclinations?
46绊傈 3:4 For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apollos," are you not merely human?
46绊傈 3:5 What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each.
46绊傈 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
46绊傈 3:7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
46绊傈 3:8 The one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose, and each will receive wages according to the labor of each.
46绊傈 3:9 For we are God's servants, working together; you are God's field, God's building.
46绊傈 3:10 According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building on it. Each builder must choose with care how to build on it.
46绊傈 3:11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ.
46绊傈 3:12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--
46绊傈 3:13 the work of each builder will become visible, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each has done.
46绊傈 3:14 If what has been built on the foundation survives, the builder will receive a reward.
46绊傈 3:15 If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire.
46绊傈 3:16 Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
46绊傈 3:17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
46绊傈 3:18 Do not deceive yourselves. If you think that you are wise in this age, you should become fools so that you may become wise.
46绊傈 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness,"
46绊傈 3:20 and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile."
46绊傈 3:21 So let no one boast about human leaders. For all things are yours,
46绊傈 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future--all belong to you,
46绊傈 3:23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
46绊傈 4:1 Think of us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries.
46绊傈 4:2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.
46绊傈 4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself.
46绊傈 4:4 I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.
46绊傈 4:5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
46绊傈 4:6 I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, brothers and sisters, so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying, "Nothing beyond what is written," so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another.
46绊傈 4:7 For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?
46绊傈 4:8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Quite apart from us you have become kings! Indeed, I wish that you had become kings, so that we might be kings with you!
46绊傈 4:9 For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals.
46绊傈 4:10 We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.
46绊傈 4:11 To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless,
46绊傈 4:12 and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
46绊傈 4:13 when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.
46绊傈 4:14 I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
46绊傈 4:15 For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
46绊傈 4:16 I appeal to you, then, be imitators of me.
46绊傈 4:17 For this reason I sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, as I teach them everywhere in every church.
46绊傈 4:18 But some of you, thinking that I am not coming to you, have become arrogant.
46绊傈 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.
46绊傈 4:20 For the kingdom of God depends not on talk but on power.
46绊傈 4:21 What would you prefer? Am I to come to you with a stick, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
46绊傈 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not found even among pagans; for a man is living with his father's wife.
46绊傈 5:2 And you are arrogant! Should you not rather have mourned, so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you?
46绊傈 5:3 For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present I have already pronounced judgment
46绊傈 5:4 in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled, and my spirit is present with the power of our Lord Jesus,
46绊傈 5:5 you are to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
46绊傈 5:6 Your boasting is not a good thing. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?
46绊傈 5:7 Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, as you really are unleavened. For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed.
46绊傈 5:8 Therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
46绊傈 5:9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral persons--
46绊傈 5:10 not at all meaning the immoral of this world, or the greedy and robbers, or idolaters, since you would then need to go out of the world.
46绊傈 5:11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or robber. Do not even eat with such a one.
46绊傈 5:12 For what have I to do with judging those outside? Is it not those who are inside that you are to judge?
46绊傈 5:13 God will judge those outside. "Drive out the wicked person from among you."
46绊傈 6:1 When any of you has a grievance against another, do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous, instead of taking it before the saints?
46绊傈 6:2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
46绊傈 6:3 Do you not know that we are to judge angels--to say nothing of ordinary matters?
46绊傈 6:4 If you have ordinary cases, then, do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church?
46绊傈 6:5 I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another,
46绊傈 6:6 but a believer goes to court against a believer--and before unbelievers at that?
46绊傈 6:7 In fact, to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
46绊傈 6:8 But you yourselves wrong and defraud--and believers at that.
46绊傈 6:9 Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites,
46绊傈 6:10 thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers--none of these will inherit the kingdom of God.
46绊傈 6:11 And this is what some of you used to be. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
46绊傈 6:12 "All things are lawful for me," but not all things are beneficial. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be dominated by anything.
46绊傈 6:13 "Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food," and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is meant not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
46绊傈 6:14 And God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.
46绊傈 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
46绊傈 6:16 Do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, "The two shall be one flesh."
46绊傈 6:17 But anyone united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
46绊傈 6:18 Shun fornication! Every sin that a person commits is outside the body; but the fornicator sins against the body itself.
46绊傈 6:19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?
46绊傈 6:20 For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.
46绊傈 7:1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: "It is well for a man not to touch a woman."
46绊傈 7:2 But because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
46绊傈 7:3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
46绊傈 7:4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
46绊傈 7:5 Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
46绊傈 7:6 This I say by way of concession, not of command.
46绊傈 7:7 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind.
46绊傈 7:8 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am.
46绊傈 7:9 But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.
46绊傈 7:10 To the married I give this command--not I but the Lord--that the wife should not separate from her husband
46绊傈 7:11 (but if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
46绊傈 7:12 To the rest I say--I and not the Lord--that if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
46绊傈 7:13 And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.
46绊傈 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
46绊傈 7:15 But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. It is to peace that God has called you.
46绊傈 7:16 Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.
46绊傈 7:17 However that may be, let each of you lead the life that the Lord has assigned, to which God called you. This is my rule in all the churches.
46绊傈 7:18 Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.
46绊傈 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but obeying the commandments of God is everything.
46绊傈 7:20 Let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called.
46绊傈 7:21 Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of your present condition now more than ever.
46绊傈 7:22 For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ.
46绊傈 7:23 You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of human masters.
46绊傈 7:24 In whatever condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with God.
46绊傈 7:25 Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
46绊傈 7:26 I think that, in view of the impending crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are.
46绊傈 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
46绊傈 7:28 But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin. Yet those who marry will experience distress in this life, and I would spare you that.
46绊傈 7:29 I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none,
46绊傈 7:30 and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no possessions,
46绊傈 7:31 and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.
46绊傈 7:32 I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord;
46绊傈 7:33 but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife,
46绊傈 7:34 and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the Lord, so that they may be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please her husband.
46绊傈 7:35 I say this for your own benefit, not to put any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.
46绊傈 7:36 If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee, if his passions are strong, and so it has to be, let him marry as he wishes; it is no sin. Let them marry.
46绊傈 7:37 But if someone stands firm in his resolve, being under no necessity but having his own desire under control, and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee, he will do well.
46绊傈 7:38 So then, he who marries his fiancee does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better.
46绊傈 7:39 A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.
46绊傈 7:40 But in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
46绊傈 8:1 Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that "all of us possess knowledge." Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
46绊傈 8:2 Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge;
46绊傈 8:3 but anyone who loves God is known by him.
46绊傈 8:4 Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "no idol in the world really exists," and that "there is no God but one."
46绊傈 8:5 Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth--as in fact there are many gods and many lords--
46绊傈 8:6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
46绊傈 8:7 It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge. Since some have become so accustomed to idols until now, they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
46绊傈 8:8 "Food will not bring us close to God." We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
46绊傈 8:9 But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
46绊傈 8:10 For if others see you, who possess knowledge, eating in the temple of an idol, might they not, since their conscience is weak, be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols?
46绊傈 8:11 So by your knowledge those weak believers for whom Christ died are destroyed.
46绊傈 8:12 But when you thus sin against members of your family, and wound their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
46绊傈 8:13 Therefore, if food is a cause of their falling, I will never eat meat, so that I may not cause one of them to fall.
46绊傈 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
46绊傈 9:2 If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
46绊傈 9:3 This is my defense to those who would examine me.
46绊傈 9:4 Do we not have the right to our food and drink?
46绊傈 9:5 Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
46绊傈 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
46绊傈 9:7 Who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk?
46绊傈 9:8 Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law also say the same?
46绊傈 9:9 For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
46绊傈 9:10 Or does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was indeed written for our sake, for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop.
46绊傈 9:11 If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits?
46绊傈 9:12 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we still more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
46绊傈 9:13 Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar?
46绊傈 9:14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
46绊傈 9:15 But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing this so that they may be applied in my case. Indeed, I would rather die than that--no one will deprive me of my ground for boasting!
46绊傈 9:16 If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel!
46绊傈 9:17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission.
46绊傈 9:18 What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.
46绊傈 9:19 For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them.
46绊傈 9:20 To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law.
46绊傈 9:21 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law) so that I might win those outside the law.
46绊傈 9:22 To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some.
46绊傈 9:23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.
46绊傈 9:24 Do you not know that in a race the runners all compete, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win it.
46绊傈 9:25 Athletes exercise self-control in all things; they do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable one.
46绊傈 9:26 So I do not run aimlessly, nor do I box as though beating the air;
46绊傈 9:27 but I punish my body and enslave it, so that after proclaiming to others I myself should not be disqualified.
46绊傈 10:1 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
46绊傈 10:2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
46绊傈 10:3 and all ate the same spiritual food,
46绊傈 10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.
46绊傈 10:5 Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.
46绊傈 10:6 Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.
46绊傈 10:7 Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play."
46绊傈 10:8 We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
46绊傈 10:9 We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.
46绊傈 10:10 And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
46绊傈 10:11 These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come.
46绊傈 10:12 So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall.
46绊傈 10:13 No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.
46绊傈 10:14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols.
46绊傈 10:15 I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
46绊傈 10:16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
46绊傈 10:17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
46绊傈 10:18 Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?
46绊傈 10:19 What do I imply then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
46绊傈 10:20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.
46绊傈 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
46绊傈 10:22 Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
46绊傈 10:23 "All things are lawful," but not all things are beneficial. "All things are lawful," but not all things build up.
46绊傈 10:24 Do not seek your own advantage, but that of the other.
46绊傈 10:25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience,
46绊傈 10:26 for "the earth and its fullness are the Lord's."
46绊傈 10:27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
46绊傈 10:28 But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience--
46绊傈 10:29 I mean the other's conscience, not your own. For why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone else's conscience?
46绊傈 10:30 If I partake with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
46绊傈 10:31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.
46绊傈 10:32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,
46绊傈 10:33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved.
46绊傈 11:1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
46绊傈 11:2 I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I handed them on to you.
46绊傈 11:3 But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the husband is the head of his wife, and God is the head of Christ.
46绊傈 11:4 Any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head,
46绊傈 11:5 but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her head--it is one and the same thing as having her head shaved.
46绊傈 11:6 For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, she should wear a veil.
46绊傈 11:7 For a man ought not to have his head veiled, since he is the image and reflection of God; but woman is the reflection of man.
46绊傈 11:8 Indeed, man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
46绊傈 11:9 Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
46绊傈 11:10 For this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
46绊傈 11:11 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man or man independent of woman.
46绊傈 11:12 For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman; but all things come from God.
46绊傈 11:13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled?
46绊傈 11:14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair, it is degrading to him,
46绊傈 11:15 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
46绊傈 11:16 But if anyone is disposed to be contentious--we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.
46绊傈 11:17 Now in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
46绊傈 11:18 For, to begin with, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and to some extent I believe it.
46绊傈 11:19 Indeed, there have to be factions among you, for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine.
46绊傈 11:20 When you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord's supper.
46绊傈 11:21 For when the time comes to eat, each of you goes ahead with your own supper, and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk.
46绊傈 11:22 What! Do you not have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I commend you? In this matter I do not commend you!
46绊傈 11:23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread,
46绊傈 11:24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
46绊傈 11:25 In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."
46绊傈 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
46绊傈 11:27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord.
46绊傈 11:28 Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
46绊傈 11:29 For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and drink judgment against themselves.
46绊傈 11:30 For this reason many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
46绊傈 11:31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not be judged.
46绊傈 11:32 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
46绊傈 11:33 So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
46绊傈 11:34 If you are hungry, eat at home, so that when you come together, it will not be for your condemnation. About the other things I will give instructions when I come.
46绊傈 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.
46绊傈 12:2 You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak.
46绊傈 12:3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says "Let Jesus be cursed!" and no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit.
46绊傈 12:4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;
46绊傈 12:5 and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord;
46绊傈 12:6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone.
46绊傈 12:7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
46绊傈 12:8 To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,
46绊傈 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
46绊傈 12:10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
46绊傈 12:11 All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.
46绊傈 12:12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
46绊傈 12:13 For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--Jews or Greeks, slaves or free--and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
46绊傈 12:14 Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many.
46绊傈 12:15 If the foot would say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
46绊傈 12:16 And if the ear would say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
46绊傈 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
46绊傈 12:18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.
46绊傈 12:19 If all were a single member, where would the body be?
46绊傈 12:20 As it is, there are many members, yet one body.
46绊傈 12:21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
46绊傈 12:22 On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
46绊傈 12:23 and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;
46绊傈 12:24 whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member,
46绊傈 12:25 that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.
46绊傈 12:26 If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.
46绊傈 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
46绊傈 12:28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues.
46绊傈 12:29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
46绊傈 12:30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
46绊傈 12:31 But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.
46绊傈 13:1 If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
46绊傈 13:2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
46绊傈 13:3 If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
46绊傈 13:4 Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant
46绊傈 13:5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
46绊傈 13:6 it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.
46绊傈 13:7 It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
46绊傈 13:8 Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.
46绊傈 13:9 For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part;
46绊傈 13:10 but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end.
46绊傈 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways.
46绊傈 13:12 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.
46绊傈 13:13 And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
46绊傈 14:1 Pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts, and especially that you may prophesy.
46绊傈 14:2 For those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to God; for nobody understands them, since they are speaking mysteries in the Spirit.
46绊傈 14:3 On the other hand, those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
46绊傈 14:4 Those who speak in a tongue build up themselves, but those who prophesy build up the church.
46绊傈 14:5 Now I would like all of you to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
46绊傈 14:6 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
46绊傈 14:7 It is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as the flute or the harp. If they do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is being played?
46绊傈 14:8 And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?
46绊傈 14:9 So with yourselves; if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.
46绊傈 14:10 There are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world, and nothing is without sound.
46绊傈 14:11 If then I do not know the meaning of a sound, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
46绊傈 14:12 So with yourselves; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in them for building up the church.
46绊傈 14:13 Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.
46绊傈 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.
46绊傈 14:15 What should I do then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the mind also; I will sing praise with the spirit, but I will sing praise with the mind also.
46绊傈 14:16 Otherwise, if you say a blessing with the spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since the outsider does not know what you are saying?
46绊傈 14:17 For you may give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.
46绊傈 14:18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;
46绊傈 14:19 nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46绊傈 14:20 Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; rather, be infants in evil, but in thinking be adults.
46绊傈 14:21 In the law it is written, "By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people; yet even then they will not listen to me," says the Lord.
46绊傈 14:22 Tongues, then, are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.
46绊傈 14:23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your mind?
46绊傈 14:24 But if all prophesy, an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all.
46绊傈 14:25 After the secrets of the unbeliever's heart are disclosed, that person will bow down before God and worship him, declaring, "God is really among you."
46绊傈 14:26 What should be done then, my friends? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
46绊傈 14:27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.
46绊傈 14:28 But if there is no one to interpret, let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to God.
46绊傈 14:29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.
46绊傈 14:30 If a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby, let the first person be silent.
46绊傈 14:31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.
46绊傈 14:32 And the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,
46绊傈 14:33 for God is a God not of disorder but of peace. (As in all the churches of the saints,
46绊傈 14:34 women should be silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the law also says.
46绊傈 14:35 If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
46绊傈 14:36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?)
46绊傈 14:37 Anyone who claims to be a prophet, or to have spiritual powers, must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.
46绊傈 14:38 Anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized.
46绊傈 14:39 So, my friends, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues;
46绊傈 14:40 but all things should be done decently and in order.
46绊傈 15:1 Now I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand,
46绊傈 15:2 through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you--unless you have come to believe in vain.
46绊傈 15:3 For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures,
46绊傈 15:4 and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures,
46绊傈 15:5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
46绊傈 15:6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.
46绊傈 15:7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
46绊傈 15:8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
46绊傈 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
46绊傈 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them--though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
46绊傈 15:11 Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.
46绊傈 15:12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
46绊傈 15:13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;
46绊傈 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain.
46绊傈 15:15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ--whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.
46绊傈 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.
46绊傈 15:17 If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.
46绊傈 15:18 Then those also who have died in Christ have perished.
46绊傈 15:19 If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
46绊傈 15:20 But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died.
46绊傈 15:21 For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being;
46绊傈 15:22 for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ.
46绊傈 15:23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.
46绊傈 15:24 Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power.
46绊傈 15:25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
46绊傈 15:26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
46绊傈 15:27 For "God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when it says, "All things are put in subjection," it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him.
46绊傈 15:28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him, so that God may be all in all.
46绊傈 15:29 Otherwise, what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?
46绊傈 15:30 And why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour?
46绊傈 15:31 I die every day! That is as certain, brothers and sisters, as my boasting of you--a boast that I make in Christ Jesus our Lord.
46绊傈 15:32 If with merely human hopes I fought with wild animals at Ephesus, what would I have gained by it? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
46绊傈 15:33 Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."
46绊傈 15:34 Come to a sober and right mind, and sin no more; for some people have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
46绊傈 15:35 But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?"
46绊傈 15:36 Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
46绊傈 15:37 And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
46绊傈 15:38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
46绊傈 15:39 Not all flesh is alike, but there is one flesh for human beings, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
46绊傈 15:40 There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.
46绊傈 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; indeed, star differs from star in glory.
46绊傈 15:42 So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.
46绊傈 15:43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
46绊傈 15:44 It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.
46绊傈 15:45 Thus it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
46绊傈 15:46 But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.
46绊傈 15:47 The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.
46绊傈 15:48 As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.
46绊傈 15:49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.
46绊傈 15:50 What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
46绊傈 15:51 Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be changed,
46绊傈 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
46绊傈 15:53 For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality.
46绊傈 15:54 When this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: "Death has been swallowed up in victory."
46绊傈 15:55 "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
46绊傈 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46绊傈 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
46绊傈 15:58 Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
46绊傈 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints: you should follow the directions I gave to the churches of Galatia.
46绊傈 16:2 On the first day of every week, each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn, so that collections need not be taken when I come.
46绊傈 16:3 And when I arrive, I will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to Jerusalem.
46绊傈 16:4 If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
46绊傈 16:5 I will visit you after passing through Macedonia--for I intend to pass through Macedonia--
46绊傈 16:6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way, wherever I go.
46绊傈 16:7 I do not want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
46绊傈 16:8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
46绊傈 16:9 for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
46绊傈 16:10 If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am;
46绊傈 16:11 therefore let no one despise him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I am expecting him with the brothers.
46绊傈 16:12 Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not at all willing to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.
46绊傈 16:13 Keep alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous, be strong.
46绊傈 16:14 Let all that you do be done in love.
46绊傈 16:15 Now, brothers and sisters, you know that members of the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints;
46绊傈 16:16 I urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people, and of everyone who works and toils with them.
46绊傈 16:17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence;
46绊傈 16:18 for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such persons.
46绊傈 16:19 The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.
46绊傈 16:20 All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
46绊傈 16:21 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
46绊傈 16:22 Let anyone be accursed who has no love for the Lord. Our Lord, come!
46绊傈 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
46绊傈 16:24 My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
47
47绊饶 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God that is in Corinth, including all the saints throughout Achaia:
47绊饶 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
47绊饶 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation,
47绊饶 1:4 who consoles us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction with the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by God.
47绊饶 1:5 For just as the sufferings of Christ are abundant for us, so also our consolation is abundant through Christ.
47绊饶 1:6 If we are being afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation; if we are being consoled, it is for your consolation, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering.
47绊饶 1:7 Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our consolation.
47绊饶 1:8 We do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of the affliction we experienced in Asia; for we were so utterly, unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself.
47绊饶 1:9 Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
47绊饶 1:10 He who rescued us from so deadly a peril will continue to rescue us; on him we have set our hope that he will rescue us again,
47绊饶 1:11 as you also join in helping us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.
47绊饶 1:12 Indeed, this is our boast, the testimony of our conscience: we have behaved in the world with frankness and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God--and all the more toward you.
47绊饶 1:13 For we write you nothing other than what you can read and also understand; I hope you will understand until the end--
47绊饶 1:14 as you have already understood us in part--that on the day of the Lord Jesus we are your boast even as you are our boast.
47绊饶 1:15 Since I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double favor;
47绊饶 1:16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on to Judea.
47绊饶 1:17 Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to ordinary human standards, ready to say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
47绊饶 1:18 As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been "Yes and No."
47绊饶 1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not "Yes and No"; but in him it is always "Yes."
47绊饶 1:20 For in him every one of God's promises is a "Yes." For this reason it is through him that we say the "Amen," to the glory of God.
47绊饶 1:21 But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us,
47绊饶 1:22 by putting his seal on us and giving us his Spirit in our hearts as a first installment.
47绊饶 1:23 But I call on God as witness against me: it was to spare you that I did not come again to Corinth.
47绊饶 1:24 I do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith; rather, we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in the faith.
47绊饶 2:1 So I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit.
47绊饶 2:2 For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
47绊饶 2:3 And I wrote as I did, so that when I came, I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice; for I am confident about all of you, that my joy would be the joy of all of you.
47绊饶 2:4 For I wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain, but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
47绊饶 2:5 But if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but to some extent--not to exaggerate it--to all of you.
47绊饶 2:6 This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person;
47绊饶 2:7 so now instead you should forgive and console him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
47绊饶 2:8 So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
47绊饶 2:9 I wrote for this reason: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything.
47绊饶 2:10 Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ.
47绊饶 2:11 And we do this so that we may not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.
47绊饶 2:12 When I came to Troas to proclaim the good news of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord;
47绊饶 2:13 but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said farewell to them and went on to Macedonia.
47绊饶 2:14 But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.
47绊饶 2:15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;
47绊饶 2:16 to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
47绊饶 2:17 For we are not peddlers of God's word like so many; but in Christ we speak as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God and standing in his presence.
47绊饶 3:1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Surely we do not need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we?
47绊饶 3:2 You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all;
47绊饶 3:3 and you show that you are a letter of Christ, prepared by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
47绊饶 3:4 Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
47绊饶 3:5 Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our competence is from God,
47绊饶 3:6 who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of letter but of spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
47绊饶 3:7 Now if the ministry of death, chiseled in letters on stone tablets, came in glory so that the people of Israel could not gaze at Moses' face because of the glory of his face, a glory now set aside,
47绊饶 3:8 how much more will the ministry of the Spirit come in glory?
47绊饶 3:9 For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory!
47绊饶 3:10 Indeed, what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory;
47绊饶 3:11 for if what was set aside came through glory, much more has the permanent come in glory!
47绊饶 3:12 Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness,
47绊饶 3:13 not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside.
47绊饶 3:14 But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside.
47绊饶 3:15 Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds;
47绊饶 3:16 but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
47绊饶 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
47绊饶 3:18 And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.
47绊饶 4:1 Therefore, since it is by God's mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.
47绊饶 4:2 We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God's word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.
47绊饶 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
47绊饶 4:4 In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
47绊饶 4:5 For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake.
47绊饶 4:6 For it is the God who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
47绊饶 4:7 But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.
47绊饶 4:8 We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
47绊饶 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
47绊饶 4:10 always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies.
47绊饶 4:11 For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.
47绊饶 4:12 So death is at work in us, but life in you.
47绊饶 4:13 But just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripture--"I believed, and so I spoke"--we also believe, and so we speak,
47绊饶 4:14 because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will bring us with you into his presence.
47绊饶 4:15 Yes, everything is for your sake, so that grace, as it extends to more and more people, may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
47绊饶 4:16 So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day.
47绊饶 4:17 For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure,
47绊饶 4:18 because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.
47绊饶 5:1 For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
47绊饶 5:2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling--
47绊饶 5:3 if indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be found naked.
47绊饶 5:4 For while we are still in this tent, we groan under our burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
47绊饶 5:5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
47绊饶 5:6 So we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord--
47绊饶 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight.
47绊饶 5:8 Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
47绊饶 5:9 So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.
47绊饶 5:10 For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.
47绊饶 5:11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others; but we ourselves are well known to God, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences.
47绊饶 5:12 We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart.
47绊饶 5:13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
47绊饶 5:14 For the love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died.
47绊饶 5:15 And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them.
47绊饶 5:16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way.
47绊饶 5:17 So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new!
47绊饶 5:18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation;
47绊饶 5:19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us.
47绊饶 5:20 So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
47绊饶 5:21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
47绊饶 6:1 As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain.
47绊饶 6:2 For he says, "At an acceptable time I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you." See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation!
47绊饶 6:3 We are putting no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
47绊饶 6:4 but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,
47绊饶 6:5 beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
47绊饶 6:6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love,
47绊饶 6:7 truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
47绊饶 6:8 in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;
47绊饶 6:9 as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see--we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed;
47绊饶 6:10 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
47绊饶 6:11 We have spoken frankly to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you.
47绊饶 6:12 There is no restriction in our affections, but only in yours.
47绊饶 6:13 In return--I speak as to children--open wide your hearts also.
47绊饶 6:14 Do not be mismatched with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship is there between light and darkness?
47绊饶 6:15 What agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what does a believer share with an unbeliever?
47绊饶 6:16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, "I will live in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
47绊饶 6:17 Therefore come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you,
47绊饶 6:18 and I will be your father, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."
47绊饶 7:1 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit, making holiness perfect in the fear of God.
47绊饶 7:2 Make room in your hearts for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.
47绊饶 7:3 I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
47绊饶 7:4 I often boast about you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with consolation; I am overjoyed in all our affliction.
47绊饶 7:5 For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way--disputes without and fears within.
47绊饶 7:6 But God, who consoles the downcast, consoled us by the arrival of Titus,
47绊饶 7:7 and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.
47绊饶 7:8 For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it, for I see that I grieved you with that letter, though only briefly).
47绊饶 7:9 Now I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because your grief led to repentance; for you felt a godly grief, so that you were not harmed in any way by us.
47绊饶 7:10 For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly grief produces death.
47绊饶 7:11 For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter.
47绊饶 7:12 So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who was wronged, but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before God.
47绊饶 7:13 In this we find comfort. In addition to our own consolation, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his mind has been set at rest by all of you.
47绊饶 7:14 For if I have been somewhat boastful about you to him, I was not disgraced; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved true as well.
47绊饶 7:15 And his heart goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of all of you, and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling.
47绊饶 7:16 I rejoice, because I have complete confidence in you.
47绊饶 8:1 We want you to know, brothers and sisters, about the grace of God that has been granted to the churches of Macedonia;
47绊饶 8:2 for during a severe ordeal of affliction, their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
47绊饶 8:3 For, as I can testify, they voluntarily gave according to their means, and even beyond their means,
47绊饶 8:4 begging us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in this ministry to the saints--
47绊饶 8:5 and this, not merely as we expected; they gave themselves first to the Lord and, by the will of God, to us,
47绊饶 8:6 so that we might urge Titus that, as he had already made a beginning, so he should also complete this generous undertaking among you.
47绊饶 8:7 Now as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in utmost eagerness, and in our love for you--so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking.
47绊饶 8:8 I do not say this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others.
47绊饶 8:9 For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.
47绊饶 8:10 And in this matter I am giving my advice: it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something--
47绊饶 8:11 now finish doing it, so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means.
47绊饶 8:12 For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has--not according to what one does not have.
47绊饶 8:13 I do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you, but it is a question of a fair balance between
47绊饶 8:14 your present abundance and their need, so that their abundance may be for your need, in order that there may be a fair balance.
47绊饶 8:15 As it is written, "The one who had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too little."
47绊饶 8:16 But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same eagerness for you that I myself have.
47绊饶 8:17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but since he is more eager than ever, he is going to you of his own accord.
47绊饶 8:18 With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his proclaiming the good news;
47绊饶 8:19 and not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this generous undertaking for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our goodwill.
47绊饶 8:20 We intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering,
47绊饶 8:21 for we intend to do what is right not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of others.
47绊饶 8:22 And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found eager in many matters, but who is now more eager than ever because of his great confidence in you.
47绊饶 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker in your service; as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
47绊饶 8:24 Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.
47绊饶 9:1 Now it is not necessary for me to write you about the ministry to the saints,
47绊饶 9:2 for I know your eagerness, which is the subject of my boasting about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.
47绊饶 9:3 But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not prove to have been empty in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be;
47绊饶 9:4 otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated--to say nothing of you--in this undertaking.
47绊饶 9:5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you, and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised, so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion.
47绊饶 9:6 The point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
47绊饶 9:7 Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
47绊饶 9:8 And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that by always having enough of everything, you may share abundantly in every good work.
47绊饶 9:9 As it is written, "He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures forever."
47绊饶 9:10 He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
47绊饶 9:11 You will be enriched in every way for your great generosity, which will produce thanksgiving to God through us;
47绊饶 9:12 for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God.
47绊饶 9:13 Through the testing of this ministry you glorify God by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others,
47绊饶 9:14 while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God that he has given you.
47绊饶 9:15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
47绊饶 10:1 I myself, Paul, appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!--
47绊饶 10:2 I ask that when I am present I need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards.
47绊饶 10:3 Indeed, we live as human beings, but we do not wage war according to human standards;
47绊饶 10:4 for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but they have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments
47绊饶 10:5 and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to obey Christ.
47绊饶 10:6 We are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete.
47绊饶 10:7 Look at what is before your eyes. If you are confident that you belong to Christ, remind yourself of this, that just as you belong to Christ, so also do we.
47绊饶 10:8 Now, even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it.
47绊饶 10:9 I do not want to seem as though I am trying to frighten you with my letters.
47绊饶 10:10 For they say, "His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
47绊饶 10:11 Let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent, we will also do when present.
47绊饶 10:12 We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they do not show good sense.
47绊饶 10:13 We, however, will not boast beyond limits, but will keep within the field that God has assigned to us, to reach out even as far as you.
47绊饶 10:14 For we were not overstepping our limits when we reached you; we were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of Christ.
47绊饶 10:15 We do not boast beyond limits, that is, in the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith increases, our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged,
47绊饶 10:16 so that we may proclaim the good news in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in someone else's sphere of action.
47绊饶 10:17 "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
47绊饶 10:18 For it is not those who commend themselves that are approved, but those whom the Lord commends.
47绊饶 11:1 I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!
47绊饶 11:2 I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
47绊饶 11:3 But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
47绊饶 11:4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.
47绊饶 11:5 I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.
47绊饶 11:6 I may be untrained in speech, but not in knowledge; certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you.
47绊饶 11:7 Did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed God's good news to you free of charge?
47绊饶 11:8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
47绊饶 11:9 And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from Macedonia. So I refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way.
47绊饶 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
47绊饶 11:11 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
47绊饶 11:12 And what I do I will also continue to do, in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about.
47绊饶 11:13 For such boasters are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
47绊饶 11:14 And no wonder! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
47绊饶 11:15 So it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness. Their end will match their deeds.
47绊饶 11:16 I repeat, let no one think that I am a fool; but if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
47绊饶 11:17 What I am saying in regard to this boastful confidence, I am saying not with the Lord's authority, but as a fool;
47绊饶 11:18 since many boast according to human standards, I will also boast.
47绊饶 11:19 For you gladly put up with fools, being wise yourselves!
47绊饶 11:20 For you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or gives you a slap in the face.
47绊饶 11:21 To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone dares to boast of--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast of that.
47绊饶 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
47绊饶 11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? I am talking like a madman--I am a better one: with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless floggings, and often near death.
47绊饶 11:24 Five times I have received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
47绊饶 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked; for a night and a day I was adrift at sea;
47绊饶 11:26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from bandits, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers and sisters;
47绊饶 11:27 in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, hungry and thirsty, often without food, cold and naked.
47绊饶 11:28 And, besides other things, I am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches.
47绊饶 11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I am not indignant?
47绊饶 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
47绊饶 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus (blessed be he forever!) knows that I do not lie.
47绊饶 11:32 In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize me,
47绊饶 11:33 but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.
47绊饶 12:1 It is necessary to boast; nothing is to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
47绊饶 12:2 I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows.
47绊饶 12:3 And I know that such a person--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows--
47绊饶 12:4 was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat.
47绊饶 12:5 On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
47绊饶 12:6 But if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me,
47绊饶 12:7 even considering the exceptional character of the revelations. Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated.
47绊饶 12:8 Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me,
47绊饶 12:9 but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
47绊饶 12:10 Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.
47绊饶 12:11 I have been a fool! You forced me to it. Indeed you should have been the ones commending me, for I am not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing.
47绊饶 12:12 The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, signs and wonders and mighty works.
47绊饶 12:13 How have you been worse off than the other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
47绊饶 12:14 Here I am, ready to come to you this third time. And I will not be a burden, because I do not want what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children.
47绊饶 12:15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
47绊饶 12:16 Let it be assumed that I did not burden you. Nevertheless (you say) since I was crafty, I took you in by deceit.
47绊饶 12:17 Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you?
47绊饶 12:18 I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
47绊饶 12:19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you? We are speaking in Christ before God. Everything we do, beloved, is for the sake of building you up.
47绊饶 12:20 For I fear that when I come, I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish; I fear that there may perhaps be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.
47绊饶 12:21 I fear that when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and that I may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and licentiousness that they have practiced.
47绊饶 13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. "Any charge must be sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
47绊饶 13:2 I warned those who sinned previously and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again, I will not be lenient--
47绊饶 13:3 since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you.
47绊饶 13:4 For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.
47绊饶 13:5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless, indeed, you fail to meet the test!
47绊饶 13:6 I hope you will find out that we have not failed.
47绊饶 13:7 But we pray to God that you may not do anything wrong--not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed.
47绊饶 13:8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
47绊饶 13:9 For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. This is what we pray for, that you may become perfect.
47绊饶 13:10 So I write these things while I am away from you, so that when I come, I may not have to be severe in using the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
47绊饶 13:11 Finally, brothers and sisters, farewell. Put things in order, listen to my appeal, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
47绊饶 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.
47绊饶 13:13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.

48哎 1:1 Paul an apostle--sent neither by human commission nor from human authorities, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--
48哎 1:2 and all the members of God's family who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:
48哎 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48哎 1:4 who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48哎 1:5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
48哎 1:6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--
48哎 1:7 not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.
48哎 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that one be accursed!
48哎 1:9 As we have said before, so now I repeat, if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that one be accursed!
48哎 1:10 Am I now seeking human approval, or God's approval? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still pleasing people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48哎 1:11 For I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin;
48哎 1:12 for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
48哎 1:13 You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it.
48哎 1:14 I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
48哎 1:15 But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased
48哎 1:16 to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being,
48哎 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.
48哎 1:18 Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days;
48哎 1:19 but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother.
48哎 1:20 In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!
48哎 1:21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,
48哎 1:22 and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;
48哎 1:23 they only heard it said, "The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy."
48哎 1:24 And they glorified God because of me.
48哎 2:1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
48哎 2:2 I went up in response to a revelation. Then I laid before them (though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure that I was not running, or had not run, in vain.
48哎 2:3 But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.
48哎 2:4 But because of false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us--
48哎 2:5 we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.
48哎 2:6 And from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders (what they actually were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--those leaders contributed nothing to me.
48哎 2:7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised
48哎 2:8 (for he who worked through Peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the Gentiles),
48哎 2:9 and when James and Cephas and John, who were acknowledged pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
48哎 2:10 They asked only one thing, that we remember the poor, which was actually what I was eager to do.
48哎 2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood self-condemned;
48哎 2:12 for until certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But after they came, he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction.
48哎 2:13 And the other Jews joined him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
48哎 2:14 But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, "If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
48哎 2:15 We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;
48哎 2:16 yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law.
48哎 2:17 But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!
48哎 2:18 But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor.
48哎 2:19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ;
48哎 2:20 and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48哎 2:21 I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
48哎 3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!
48哎 3:2 The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?
48哎 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?
48哎 3:4 Did you experience so much for nothing?--if it really was for nothing.
48哎 3:5 Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
48哎 3:6 Just as Abraham "believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,"
48哎 3:7 so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham.
48哎 3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "All the Gentiles shall be blessed in you."
48哎 3:9 For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed.
48哎 3:10 For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law."
48哎 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law; for "The one who is righteous will live by faith."
48哎 3:12 But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, "Whoever does the works of the law will live by them."
48哎 3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us--for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree"--
48哎 3:14 in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
48哎 3:15 Brothers and sisters, I give an example from daily life: once a person's will has been ratified, no one adds to it or annuls it.
48哎 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring; it does not say, "And to offsprings," as of many; but it says, "And to your offspring," that is, to one person, who is Christ.
48哎 3:17 My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
48哎 3:18 For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.
48哎 3:19 Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator.
48哎 3:20 Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one.
48哎 3:21 Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law.
48哎 3:22 But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
48哎 3:23 Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed.
48哎 3:24 Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.
48哎 3:25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian,
48哎 3:26 for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.
48哎 3:27 As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48哎 3:28 There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.
48哎 3:29 And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise.
48哎 4:1 My point is this: heirs, as long as they are minors, are no better than slaves, though they are the owners of all the property;
48哎 4:2 but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father.
48哎 4:3 So with us; while we were minors, we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world.
48哎 4:4 But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
48哎 4:5 in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children.
48哎 4:6 And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
48哎 4:7 So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.
48哎 4:8 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods.
48哎 4:9 Now, however, that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? How can you want to be enslaved to them again?
48哎 4:10 You are observing special days, and months, and seasons, and years.
48哎 4:11 I am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted.
48哎 4:12 Friends, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong.
48哎 4:13 You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I first announced the gospel to you;
48哎 4:14 though my condition put you to the test, you did not scorn or despise me, but welcomed me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
48哎 4:15 What has become of the good will you felt? For I testify that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48哎 4:16 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48哎 4:17 They make much of you, but for no good purpose; they want to exclude you, so that you may make much of them.
48哎 4:18 It is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
48哎 4:19 My little children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
48哎 4:20 I wish I were present with you now and could change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
48哎 4:21 Tell me, you who desire to be subject to the law, will you not listen to the law?
48哎 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.
48哎 4:23 One, the child of the slave, was born according to the flesh; the other, the child of the free woman, was born through the promise.
48哎 4:24 Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One woman, in fact, is Hagar, from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery.
48哎 4:25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48哎 4:26 But the other woman corresponds to the Jerusalem above; she is free, and she is our mother.
48哎 4:27 For it is written, "Rejoice, you childless one, you who bear no children, burst into song and shout, you who endure no birthpangs; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married."
48哎 4:28 Now you, my friends, are children of the promise, like Isaac.
48哎 4:29 But just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.
48哎 4:30 But what does the scripture say? "Drive out the slave and her child; for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman."
48哎 4:31 So then, friends, we are children, not of the slave but of the free woman.
48哎 5:1 For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
48哎 5:2 Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
48哎 5:3 Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law.
48哎 5:4 You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
48哎 5:5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.
48哎 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that counts is faith working through love.
48哎 5:7 You were running well; who prevented you from obeying the truth?
48哎 5:8 Such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
48哎 5:9 A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.
48哎 5:10 I am confident about you in the Lord that you will not think otherwise. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.
48哎 5:11 But my friends, why am I still being persecuted if I am still preaching circumcision? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
48哎 5:12 I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!
48哎 5:13 For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another.
48哎 5:14 For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
48哎 5:15 If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
48哎 5:16 Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.
48哎 5:17 For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want.
48哎 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law.
48哎 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness,
48哎 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions,
48哎 5:21 envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48哎 5:22 By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,
48哎 5:23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.
48哎 5:24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
48哎 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.
48哎 5:26 Let us not become conceited, competing against one another, envying one another.
48哎 6:1 My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted.
48哎 6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48哎 6:3 For if those who are nothing think they are something, they deceive themselves.
48哎 6:4 All must test their own work; then that work, rather than their neighbor's work, will become a cause for pride.
48哎 6:5 For all must carry their own loads.
48哎 6:6 Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher.
48哎 6:7 Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow.
48哎 6:8 If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
48哎 6:9 So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest-time, if we do not give up.
48哎 6:10 So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.
48哎 6:11 See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand!
48哎 6:12 It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised--only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48哎 6:13 Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh.
48哎 6:14 May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48哎 6:15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything!
48哎 6:16 As for those who will follow this rule--peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
48哎 6:17 From now on, let no one make trouble for me; for I carry the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
48哎 6:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.

49喀 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus:
49喀 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49喀 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,
49喀 1:4 just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love.
49喀 1:5 He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
49喀 1:6 to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
49喀 1:7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace
49喀 1:8 that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight
49喀 1:9 he has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ,
49喀 1:10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
49喀 1:11 In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will,
49喀 1:12 so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory.
49喀 1:13 In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit;
49喀 1:14 this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God's own people, to the praise of his glory.
49喀 1:15 I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason
49喀 1:16 I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers.
49喀 1:17 I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him,
49喀 1:18 so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,
49喀 1:19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power.
49喀 1:20 God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
49喀 1:21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come.
49喀 1:22 And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church,
49喀 1:23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
49喀 2:1 You were dead through the trespasses and sins
49喀 2:2 in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient.
49喀 2:3 All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else.
49喀 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us
49喀 2:5 even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ--by grace you have been saved--
49喀 2:6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
49喀 2:7 so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
49喀 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God--
49喀 2:9 not the result of works, so that no one may boast.
49喀 2:10 For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.
49喀 2:11 So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called "the uncircumcision" by those who are called "the circumcision"--a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands--
49喀 2:12 remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
49喀 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
49喀 2:14 For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us.
49喀 2:15 He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace,
49喀 2:16 and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it.
49喀 2:17 So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near;
49喀 2:18 for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father.
49喀 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God,
49喀 2:20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.
49喀 2:21 In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
49喀 2:22 in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.
49喀 3:1 This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
49喀 3:2 for surely you have already heard of the commission of God's grace that was given me for you,
49喀 3:3 and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words,
49喀 3:4 a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ.
49喀 3:5 In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
49喀 3:6 that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
49喀 3:7 Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.
49喀 3:8 Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ,
49喀 3:9 and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things;
49喀 3:10 so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
49喀 3:11 This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
49喀 3:12 in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.
49喀 3:13 I pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you; they are your glory.
49喀 3:14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
49喀 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name.
49喀 3:16 I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit,
49喀 3:17 and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love.
49喀 3:18 I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
49喀 3:19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
49喀 3:20 Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine,
49喀 3:21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
49喀 4:1 I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,
49喀 4:2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
49喀 4:3 making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
49喀 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling,
49喀 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49喀 4:6 one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.
49喀 4:7 But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ's gift.
49喀 4:8 Therefore it is said, "When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people."
49喀 4:9 (When it says, "He ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
49喀 4:10 He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)
49喀 4:11 The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,
49喀 4:12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,
49喀 4:13 until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.
49喀 4:14 We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.
49喀 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,
49喀 4:16 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body's growth in building itself up in love.
49喀 4:17 Now this I affirm and insist on in the Lord: you must no longer live as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds.
49喀 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.
49喀 4:19 They have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
49喀 4:20 That is not the way you learned Christ!
49喀 4:21 For surely you have heard about him and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus.
49喀 4:22 You were taught to put away your former way of life, your old self, corrupt and deluded by its lusts,
49喀 4:23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
49喀 4:24 and to clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
49喀 4:25 So then, putting away falsehood, let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors, for we are members of one another.
49喀 4:26 Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
49喀 4:27 and do not make room for the devil.
49喀 4:28 Thieves must give up stealing; rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands, so as to have something to share with the needy.
49喀 4:29 Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to those who hear.
49喀 4:30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.
49喀 4:31 Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice,
49喀 4:32 and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you.
49喀 5:1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children,
49喀 5:2 and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49喀 5:3 But fornication and impurity of any kind, or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints.
49喀 5:4 Entirely out of place is obscene, silly, and vulgar talk; but instead, let there be thanksgiving.
49喀 5:5 Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure person, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
49喀 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient.
49喀 5:7 Therefore do not be associated with them.
49喀 5:8 For once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light--
49喀 5:9 for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.
49喀 5:10 Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
49喀 5:11 Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.
49喀 5:12 For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly;
49喀 5:13 but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
49喀 5:14 for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, "Sleeper, awake! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49喀 5:15 Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,
49喀 5:16 making the most of the time, because the days are evil.
49喀 5:17 So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
49喀 5:18 Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,
49喀 5:19 as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,
49喀 5:20 giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
49喀 5:21 Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49喀 5:22 Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord.
49喀 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior.
49喀 5:24 Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.
49喀 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
49喀 5:26 in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word,
49喀 5:27 so as to present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind--yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish.
49喀 5:28 In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49喀 5:29 For no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,
49喀 5:30 because we are members of his body.
49喀 5:31 "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
49喀 5:32 This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church.
49喀 5:33 Each of you, however, should love his wife as himself, and a wife should respect her husband.
49喀 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
49喀 6:2 "Honor your father and mother"--this is the first commandment with a promise:
49喀 6:3 "so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth."
49喀 6:4 And, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
49喀 6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ;
49喀 6:6 not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
49喀 6:7 Render service with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not to men and women,
49喀 6:8 knowing that whatever good we do, we will receive the same again from the Lord, whether we are slaves or free.
49喀 6:9 And, masters, do the same to them. Stop threatening them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and with him there is no partiality.
49喀 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.
49喀 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
49喀 6:12 For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
49喀 6:13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
49喀 6:14 Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness.
49喀 6:15 As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace.
49喀 6:16 With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49喀 6:17 Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49喀 6:18 Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints.
49喀 6:19 Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
49喀 6:20 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I must speak.
49喀 6:21 So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus will tell you everything. He is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord.
49喀 6:22 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, to let you know how we are, and to encourage your hearts.
49喀 6:23 Peace be to the whole community, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49喀 6:24 Grace be with all who have an undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.

50呼 1:1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
50呼 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50呼 1:3 I thank my God every time I remember you,
50呼 1:4 constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you,
50呼 1:5 because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now.
50呼 1:6 I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ.
50呼 1:7 It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God's grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
50呼 1:8 For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.
50呼 1:9 And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight
50呼 1:10 to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless,
50呼 1:11 having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.
50呼 1:12 I want you to know, beloved that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel,
50呼 1:13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ;
50呼 1:14 and most of the brothers and sisters, having been made confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear.
50呼 1:15 Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.
50呼 1:16 These proclaim Christ out of love, knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel;
50呼 1:17 the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment.
50呼 1:18 What does it matter? Just this, that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
50呼 1:19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance.
50呼 1:20 It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in any way, but that by my speaking with all boldness, Christ will be exalted now as always in my body, whether by life or by death.
50呼 1:21 For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.
50呼 1:22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which I prefer.
50呼 1:23 I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;
50呼 1:24 but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.
50呼 1:25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith,
50呼 1:26 so that I may share abundantly in your boasting in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.
50呼 1:27 Only, live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you, I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel,
50呼 1:28 and are in no way intimidated by your opponents. For them this is evidence of their destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God's doing.
50呼 1:29 For he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in Christ, but of suffering for him as well--
50呼 1:30 since you are having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
50呼 2:1 If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy,
50呼 2:2 make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
50呼 2:3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves.
50呼 2:4 Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others.
50呼 2:5 Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,
50呼 2:6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,
50呼 2:7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form,
50呼 2:8 he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death--even death on a cross.
50呼 2:9 Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,
50呼 2:10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50呼 2:11 and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50呼 2:12 Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
50呼 2:13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
50呼 2:14 Do all things without murmuring and arguing,
50呼 2:15 so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine like stars in the world.
50呼 2:16 It is by your holding fast to the word of life that I can boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
50呼 2:17 But even if I am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you--
50呼 2:18 and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me.
50呼 2:19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be cheered by news of you.
50呼 2:20 I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
50呼 2:21 All of them are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50呼 2:22 But Timothy's worth you know, how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
50呼 2:23 I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see how things go with me;
50呼 2:24 and I trust in the Lord that I will also come soon.
50呼 2:25 Still, I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus--my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, your messenger and minister to my need;
50呼 2:26 for he has been longing for all of you, and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
50呼 2:27 He was indeed so ill that he nearly died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.
50呼 2:28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
50呼 2:29 Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy, and honor such people,
50呼 2:30 because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me.
50呼 3:1 Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, and for you it is a safeguard.
50呼 3:2 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!
50呼 3:3 For it is we who are the circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh--
50呼 3:4 even though I, too, have reason for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more:
50呼 3:5 circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
50呼 3:6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
50呼 3:7 Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ.
50呼 3:8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ
50呼 3:9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith.
50呼 3:10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,
50呼 3:11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
50呼 3:12 Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
50呼 3:13 Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
50呼 3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.
50呼 3:15 Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you.
50呼 3:16 Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.
50呼 3:17 Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us.
50呼 3:18 For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears.
50呼 3:19 Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things.
50呼 3:20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
50呼 3:21 He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.
50呼 4:1 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.
50呼 4:2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
50呼 4:3 Yes, and I ask you also, my loyal companion, help these women, for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
50呼 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice.
50呼 4:5 Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.
50呼 4:6 Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
50呼 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50呼 4:8 Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
50呼 4:9 Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
50呼 4:10 I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned for me, but had no opportunity to show it.
50呼 4:11 Not that I am referring to being in need; for I have learned to be content with whatever I have.
50呼 4:12 I know what it is to have little, and I know what it is to have plenty. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being well-fed and of going hungry, of having plenty and of being in need.
50呼 4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
50呼 4:14 In any case, it was kind of you to share my distress.
50呼 4:15 You Philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone.
50呼 4:16 For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me help for my needs more than once.
50呼 4:17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that accumulates to your account.
50呼 4:18 I have been paid in full and have more than enough; I am fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
50呼 4:19 And my God will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
50呼 4:20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
50呼 4:21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The friends who are with me greet you.
50呼 4:22 All the saints greet you, especially those of the emperor's household.
50呼 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
51
51榜 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51榜 1:2 To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
51榜 1:3 In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
51榜 1:4 for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,
51榜 1:5 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel
51榜 1:6 that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God.
51榜 1:7 This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
51榜 1:8 and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.
51榜 1:9 For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
51榜 1:10 so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God.
51榜 1:11 May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully
51榜 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
51榜 1:13 He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,
51榜 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51榜 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
51榜 1:16 for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers--all things have been created through him and for him.
51榜 1:17 He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51榜 1:18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.
51榜 1:19 For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
51榜 1:20 and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.
51榜 1:21 And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,
51榜 1:22 he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him--
51榜 1:23 provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.
51榜 1:24 I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church.
51榜 1:25 I became its servant according to God's commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,
51榜 1:26 the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints.
51榜 1:27 To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51榜 1:28 It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.
51榜 1:29 For this I toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me.
51榜 2:1 For I want you to know how much I am struggling for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me face to face.
51榜 2:2 I want their hearts to be encouraged and united in love, so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ himself,
51榜 2:3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51榜 2:4 I am saying this so that no one may deceive you with plausible arguments.
51榜 2:5 For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, and I rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
51榜 2:6 As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live your lives in him,
51榜 2:7 rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
51榜 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ.
51榜 2:9 For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
51榜 2:10 and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority.
51榜 2:11 In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ;
51榜 2:12 when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
51榜 2:13 And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses,
51榜 2:14 erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.
51榜 2:15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.
51榜 2:16 Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths.
51榜 2:17 These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.
51榜 2:18 Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking,
51榜 2:19 and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.
51榜 2:20 If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations,
51榜 2:21 "Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch"?
51榜 2:22 All these regulations refer to things that perish with use; they are simply human commands and teachings.
51榜 2:23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value in checking self-indulgence.
51榜 3:1 So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
51榜 3:2 Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth,
51榜 3:3 for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
51榜 3:4 When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
51榜 3:5 Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).
51榜 3:6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.
51榜 3:7 These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life.
51榜 3:8 But now you must get rid of all such things--anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth.
51榜 3:9 Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices
51榜 3:10 and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator.
51榜 3:11 In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!
51榜 3:12 As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
51榜 3:13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
51榜 3:14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
51榜 3:15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.
51榜 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God.
51榜 3:17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51榜 3:18 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51榜 3:19 Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.
51榜 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is your acceptable duty in the Lord.
51榜 3:21 Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they may lose heart.
51榜 3:22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched and in order to please them, but wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.
51榜 3:23 Whatever your task, put yourselves into it, as done for the Lord and not for your masters,
51榜 3:24 since you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward; you serve the Lord Christ.
51榜 3:25 For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done, and there is no partiality.
51榜 4:1 Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, for you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
51榜 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving.
51榜 4:3 At the same time pray for us as well that God will open to us a door for the word, that we may declare the mystery of Christ, for which I am in prison,
51榜 4:4 so that I may reveal it clearly, as I should.
51榜 4:5 Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time.
51榜 4:6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone.
51榜 4:7 Tychicus will tell you all the news about me; he is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.
51榜 4:8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts;
51榜 4:9 he is coming with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.
51榜 4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom you have received instructions--if he comes to you, welcome him.
51榜 4:11 And Jesus who is called Justus greets you. These are the only ones of the circumcision among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
51榜 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that God wills.
51榜 4:13 For I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
51榜 4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
51榜 4:15 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51榜 4:16 And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea.
51榜 4:17 And say to Archippus, "See that you complete the task that you have received in the Lord."
51榜 4:18 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
52
52混傈 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
52混傈 1:2 We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly
52混傈 1:3 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
52混傈 1:4 For we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you,
52混傈 1:5 because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake.
52混傈 1:6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,
52混傈 1:7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
52混傈 1:8 For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to speak about it.
52混傈 1:9 For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
52混傈 1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.
52混傈 2:1 You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain,
52混傈 2:2 but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition.
52混傈 2:3 For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery,
52混傈 2:4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts.
52混傈 2:5 As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed;
52混傈 2:6 nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others,
52混傈 2:7 though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children.
52混傈 2:8 So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.
52混傈 2:9 You remember our labor and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
52混傈 2:10 You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was toward you believers.
52混傈 2:11 As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children,
52混傈 2:12 urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
52混傈 2:13 We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God's word, which is also at work in you believers.
52混傈 2:14 For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews,
52混傈 2:15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out; they displease God and oppose everyone
52混傈 2:16 by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins; but God's wrath has overtaken them at last.
52混傈 2:17 As for us, brothers and sisters, when, for a short time, we were made orphans by being separated from you--in person, not in heart--we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.
52混傈 2:18 For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, wanted to again and again--but Satan blocked our way.
52混傈 2:19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?
52混傈 2:20 Yes, you are our glory and joy!
52混傈 3:1 Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we decided to be left alone in Athens;
52混傈 3:2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker for God in proclaiming the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith,
52混傈 3:3 so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions. Indeed, you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for.
52混傈 3:4 In fact, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution; so it turned out, as you know.
52混傈 3:5 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith; I was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain.
52混傈 3:6 But Timothy has just now come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love. He has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see us--just as we long to see you.
52混傈 3:7 For this reason, brothers and sisters, during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith.
52混傈 3:8 For we now live, if you continue to stand firm in the Lord.
52混傈 3:9 How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you?
52混傈 3:10 Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith.
52混傈 3:11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you.
52混傈 3:12 And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we abound in love for you.
52混傈 3:13 And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
52混傈 4:1 Finally, brothers and sisters, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus that, as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God (as, in fact, you are doing), you should do so more and more.
52混傈 4:2 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
52混傈 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication;
52混傈 4:4 that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor,
52混傈 4:5 not with lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;
52混傈 4:6 that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
52混傈 4:7 For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness.
52混傈 4:8 Therefore whoever rejects this rejects not human authority but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you.
52混傈 4:9 Now concerning love of the brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anyone write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;
52混傈 4:10 and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, beloved, to do so more and more,
52混傈 4:11 to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we directed you,
52混傈 4:12 so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one.
52混傈 4:13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
52混傈 4:14 For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died.
52混傈 4:15 For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died.
52混傈 4:16 For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel's call and with the sound of God's trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
52混傈 4:17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever.
52混傈 4:18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
52混傈 5:1 Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anything written to you.
52混傈 5:2 For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
52混傈 5:3 When they say, "There is peace and security," then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and there will be no escape!
52混傈 5:4 But you, beloved, are not in darkness, for that day to surprise you like a thief;
52混傈 5:5 for you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness.
52混傈 5:6 So then let us not fall asleep as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober;
52混傈 5:7 for those who sleep sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night.
52混傈 5:8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
52混傈 5:9 For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
52混傈 5:10 who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him.
52混傈 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.
52混傈 5:12 But we appeal to you, brothers and sisters, to respect those who labor among you, and have charge of you in the Lord and admonish you;
52混傈 5:13 esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
52混傈 5:14 And we urge you, beloved to admonish the idlers, encourage the faint hearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them.
52混傈 5:15 See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all.
52混傈 5:16 Rejoice always,
52混傈 5:17 pray without ceasing,
52混傈 5:18 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
52混傈 5:19 Do not quench the Spirit.
52混傈 5:20 Do not despise the words of prophets,
52混傈 5:21 but test everything; hold fast to what is good;
52混傈 5:22 abstain from every form of evil.
52混傈 5:23 May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
52混傈 5:24 The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.
52混傈 5:25 Beloved, pray for us.
52混傈 5:26 Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.
52混傈 5:27 I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all of them.
52混傈 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53
53混饶 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
53混饶 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53混饶 1:3 We must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing.
53混饶 1:4 Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring.
53混饶 1:5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering.
53混饶 1:6 For it is indeed just of God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
53混饶 1:7 and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
53混饶 1:8 in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
53混饶 1:9 These will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
53混饶 1:10 when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.
53混饶 1:11 To this end we always pray for you, asking that our God will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith,
53混饶 1:12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53混饶 2:1 As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters,
53混饶 2:2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as though from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here.
53混饶 2:3 Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed, the one destined for destruction.
53混饶 2:4 He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God.
53混饶 2:5 Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?
53混饶 2:6 And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed when his time comes.
53混饶 2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who now restrains it is removed.
53混饶 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming.
53混饶 2:9 The coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of Satan, who uses all power, signs, lying wonders,
53混饶 2:10 and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
53混饶 2:11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion, leading them to believe what is false,
53混饶 2:12 so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned.
53混饶 2:13 But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
53混饶 2:14 For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
53混饶 2:15 So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.
53混饶 2:16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,
53混饶 2:17 comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.
53混饶 3:1 Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere, just as it is among you,
53混饶 3:2 and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people; for not all have faith.
53混饶 3:3 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.
53混饶 3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command.
53混饶 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
53混饶 3:6 Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us.
53混饶 3:7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you,
53混饶 3:8 and we did not eat anyone's bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you.
53混饶 3:9 This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate.
53混饶 3:10 For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat.
53混饶 3:11 For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work.
53混饶 3:12 Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.
53混饶 3:13 Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.
53混饶 3:14 Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter; have nothing to do with them, so that they may be ashamed.
53混饶 3:15 Do not regard them as enemies, but warn them as believers.
53混饶 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with all of you.
53混饶 3:17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.
53混饶 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
54
54吊傈 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
54吊傈 1:2 To Timothy, my loyal child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
54吊傈 1:3 I urge you, as I did when I was on my way to Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine,
54吊傈 1:4 and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith.
54吊傈 1:5 But the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.
54吊傈 1:6 Some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk,
54吊傈 1:7 desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions.
54吊傈 1:8 Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it legitimately.
54吊傈 1:9 This means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient, for the godless and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their father or mother, for murderers,
54吊傈 1:10 fornicators, sodomites, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching
54吊傈 1:11 that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.
54吊傈 1:12 I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service,
54吊傈 1:13 even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a man of violence. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,
54吊傈 1:14 and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
54吊傈 1:15 The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the foremost.
54吊傈 1:16 But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience, making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life.
54吊傈 1:17 To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
54吊傈 1:18 I am giving you these instructions, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,
54吊傈 1:19 having faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience, certain persons have suffered shipwreck in the faith;
54吊傈 1:20 among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have turned over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
54吊傈 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone,
54吊傈 2:2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.
54吊傈 2:3 This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
54吊傈 2:4 who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
54吊傈 2:5 For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus, himself human,
54吊傈 2:6 who gave himself a ransom for all--this was attested at the right time.
54吊傈 2:7 For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
54吊傈 2:8 I desire, then, that in every place the men should pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument;
54吊傈 2:9 also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing, not with their hair braided, or with gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,
54吊傈 2:10 but with good works, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God.
54吊傈 2:11 Let a woman learn in silence with full submission.
54吊傈 2:12 I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she is to keep silent.
54吊傈 2:13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve;
54吊傈 2:14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
54吊傈 2:15 Yet she will be saved through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and holiness, with modesty.
54吊傈 3:1 The saying is sure: whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task.
54吊傈 3:2 Now a bishop must be above reproach, married only once, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an apt teacher,
54吊傈 3:3 not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and not a lover of money.
54吊傈 3:4 He must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way--
54吊傈 3:5 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?
54吊傈 3:6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
54吊傈 3:7 Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil.
54吊傈 3:8 Deacons likewise must be serious, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not greedy for money;
54吊傈 3:9 they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
54吊傈 3:10 And let them first be tested; then, if they prove themselves blameless, let them serve as deacons.
54吊傈 3:11 Women likewise must be serious, not slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things.
54吊傈 3:12 Let deacons be married only once, and let them manage their children and their households well;
54吊傈 3:13 for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
54吊傈 3:14 I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you so that,
54吊傈 3:15 if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.
54吊傈 3:16 Without any doubt, the mystery of our religion is great: He was revealed in flesh, vindicated in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed in throughout the world, taken up in glory.
54吊傈 4:1 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
54吊傈 4:2 through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron.
54吊傈 4:3 They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
54吊傈 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, provided it is received with thanksgiving;
54吊傈 4:5 for it is sanctified by God's word and by prayer.
54吊傈 4:6 If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed.
54吊傈 4:7 Have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives' tales. Train yourself in godliness,
54吊傈 4:8 for, while physical training is of some value, godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
54吊傈 4:9 The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance.
54吊傈 4:10 For to this end we toil and struggle, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
54吊傈 4:11 These are the things you must insist on and teach.
54吊傈 4:12 Let no one despise your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
54吊傈 4:13 Until I arrive, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhorting, to teaching.
54吊傈 4:14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.
54吊傈 4:15 Put these things into practice, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress.
54吊傈 4:16 Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.
54吊傈 5:1 Do not speak harshly to an older man, but speak to him as to a father, to younger men as brothers,
54吊傈 5:2 to older women as mothers, to younger women as sisters--with absolute purity.
54吊傈 5:3 Honor widows who are really widows.
54吊傈 5:4 If a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some repayment to their parents; for this is pleasing in God's sight.
54吊傈 5:5 The real widow, left alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day;
54吊傈 5:6 but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
54吊傈 5:7 Give these commands as well, so that they may be above reproach.
54吊傈 5:8 And whoever does not provide for relatives, and especially for family members, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
54吊傈 5:9 Let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once;
54吊傈 5:10 she must be well attested for her good works, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints' feet, helped the afflicted, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.
54吊傈 5:11 But refuse to put younger widows on the list; for when their sensual desires alienate them from Christ, they want to marry,
54吊傈 5:12 and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge.
54吊傈 5:13 Besides that, they learn to be idle, gadding about from house to house; and they are not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not say.
54吊傈 5:14 So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, and manage their households, so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us.
54吊傈 5:15 For some have already turned away to follow Satan.
54吊傈 5:16 If any believing woman has relatives who are really widows, let her assist them; let the church not be burdened, so that it can assist those who are real widows.
54吊傈 5:17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching;
54吊傈 5:18 for the scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and, "The laborer deserves to be paid."
54吊傈 5:19 Never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
54吊傈 5:20 As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest also may stand in fear.
54吊傈 5:21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, I warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.
54吊傈 5:22 Do not ordain anyone hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
54吊傈 5:23 No longer drink only water, but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
54吊傈 5:24 The sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment, while the sins of others follow them there.
54吊傈 5:25 So also good works are conspicuous; and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden.
54吊傈 6:1 Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed.
54吊傈 6:2 Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church; rather they must serve them all the more, since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties.
54吊傈 6:3 Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness,
54吊傈 6:4 is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words. From these come envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions,
54吊傈 6:5 and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
54吊傈 6:6 Of course, there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment;
54吊傈 6:7 for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it;
54吊傈 6:8 but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.
54吊傈 6:9 But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
54吊傈 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.
54吊傈 6:11 But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
54吊傈 6:12 Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
54吊傈 6:13 In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you
54吊傈 6:14 to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
54吊傈 6:15 which he will bring about at the right time--he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
54吊傈 6:16 It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
54吊傈 6:17 As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
54吊傈 6:18 They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share,
54吊傈 6:19 thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.
54吊傈 6:20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;
54吊傈 6:21 by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith. Grace be with you.
55
55吊饶 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, for the sake of the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
55吊饶 1:2 To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
55吊饶 1:3 I am grateful to God--whom I worship with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did--when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.
55吊饶 1:4 Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
55吊饶 1:5 I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you.
55吊饶 1:6 For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands;
55吊饶 1:7 for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.
55吊饶 1:8 Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God,
55吊饶 1:9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,
55吊饶 1:10 but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
55吊饶 1:11 For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher,
55吊饶 1:12 and for this reason I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that day what I have entrusted to him.
55吊饶 1:13 Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
55吊饶 1:14 Guard the good treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit living in us.
55吊饶 1:15 You are aware that all who are in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
55吊饶 1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;
55吊饶 1:17 when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me
55吊饶 1:18 --may the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well how much service he rendered in Ephesus.
55吊饶 2:1 You then, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus;
55吊饶 2:2 and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well.
55吊饶 2:3 Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
55吊饶 2:4 No one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs; the soldier's aim is to please the enlisting officer.
55吊饶 2:5 And in the case of an athlete, no one is crowned without competing according to the rules.
55吊饶 2:6 It is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops.
55吊饶 2:7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
55吊饶 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David--that is my gospel,
55吊饶 2:9 for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.
55吊饶 2:10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
55吊饶 2:11 The saying is sure: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
55吊饶 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us;
55吊饶 2:13 if we are faithless, he remains faithful--for he cannot deny himself.
55吊饶 2:14 Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening.
55吊饶 2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth.
55吊饶 2:16 Avoid profane chatter, for it will lead people into more and more impiety,
55吊饶 2:17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
55吊饶 2:18 who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place. They are upsetting the faith of some.
55吊饶 2:19 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who calls on the name of the Lord turn away from wickedness."
55吊饶 2:20 In a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for special use, some for ordinary.
55吊饶 2:21 All who cleanse themselves of the things I have mentioned will become special utensils, dedicated and useful to the owner of the house, ready for every good work.
55吊饶 2:22 Shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
55吊饶 2:23 Have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
55吊饶 2:24 And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone, an apt teacher, patient,
55吊饶 2:25 correcting opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth,
55吊饶 2:26 and that they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
55吊饶 3:1 You must understand this, that in the last days distressing times will come.
55吊饶 3:2 For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
55吊饶 3:3 inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, brutes, haters of good,
55吊饶 3:4 treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
55吊饶 3:5 holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid them!
55吊饶 3:6 For among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women, overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires,
55吊饶 3:7 who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
55吊饶 3:8 As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people, of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith, also oppose the truth.
55吊饶 3:9 But they will not make much progress, because, as in the case of those two men, their folly will become plain to everyone.
55吊饶 3:10 Now you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
55吊饶 3:11 my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
55吊饶 3:12 Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
55吊饶 3:13 But wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived.
55吊饶 3:14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it,
55吊饶 3:15 and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
55吊饶 3:16 All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
55吊饶 3:17 so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.
55吊饶 4:1 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you:
55吊饶 4:2 proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching.
55吊饶 4:3 For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires,
55吊饶 4:4 and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths.
55吊饶 4:5 As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.
55吊饶 4:6 As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come.
55吊饶 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
55吊饶 4:8 From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
55吊饶 4:9 Do your best to come to me soon,
55吊饶 4:10 for Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
55吊饶 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry.
55吊饶 4:12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
55吊饶 4:13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.
55吊饶 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will pay him back for his deeds.
55吊饶 4:15 You also must beware of him, for he strongly opposed our message.
55吊饶 4:16 At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them!
55吊饶 4:17 But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
55吊饶 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
55吊饶 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
55吊饶 4:20 Erastus remained in Corinth; Trophimus I left ill in Miletus.
55吊饶 4:21 Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.
55吊饶 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
56
56刁 1:1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness,
56刁 1:2 in the hope of eternal life that God, who never lies, promised before the ages began--
56刁 1:3 in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior,
56刁 1:4 To Titus, my loyal child in the faith we share: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56刁 1:5 I left you behind in Crete for this reason, so that you should put in order what remained to be done, and should appoint elders in every town, as I directed you:
56刁 1:6 someone who is blameless, married only once, whose children are believers, not accused of debauchery and not rebellious.
56刁 1:7 For a bishop, as God's steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain;
56刁 1:8 but he must be hospitable, a lover of goodness, prudent, upright, devout, and self-controlled.
56刁 1:9 He must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching, so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it.
56刁 1:10 There are also many rebellious people, idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision;
56刁 1:11 they must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach.
56刁 1:12 It was one of them, their very own prophet, who said, "Cretans are always liars, vicious brutes, lazy gluttons."
56刁 1:13 That testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply, so that they may become sound in the faith,
56刁 1:14 not paying attention to Jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth.
56刁 1:15 To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure. Their very minds and consciences are corrupted.
56刁 1:16 They profess to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
56刁 2:1 But as for you, teach what is consistent with sound doctrine.
56刁 2:2 Tell the older men to be temperate, serious, prudent, and sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.
56刁 2:3 Likewise, tell the older women to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good,
56刁 2:4 so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
56刁 2:5 to be self-controlled, chaste, good managers of the household, kind, being submissive to their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.
56刁 2:6 Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.
56刁 2:7 Show yourself in all respects a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity,
56刁 2:8 and sound speech that cannot be censured; then any opponent will be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us.
56刁 2:9 Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back,
56刁 2:10 not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior.
56刁 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all,
56刁 2:12 training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly,
56刁 2:13 while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
56刁 2:14 He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.
56刁 2:15 Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one look down on you.
56刁 3:1 Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
56刁 3:2 to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone.
56刁 3:3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, despicable, hating one another.
56刁 3:4 But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
56刁 3:5 he saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
56刁 3:6 This Spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56刁 3:7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
56刁 3:8 The saying is sure. I desire that you insist on these things, so that those who have come to believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works; these things are excellent and profitable to everyone.
56刁 3:9 But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
56刁 3:10 After a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions,
56刁 3:11 since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.
56刁 3:12 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56刁 3:13 Make every effort to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, and see that they lack nothing.
56刁 3:14 And let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs, so that they may not be unproductive.
56刁 3:15 All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.

57阁 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker,
57阁 1:2 to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
57阁 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57阁 1:4 When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God
57阁 1:5 because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus.
57阁 1:6 I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ.
57阁 1:7 I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.
57阁 1:8 For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty,
57阁 1:9 yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love--and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
57阁 1:10 I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.
57阁 1:11 Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me.
57阁 1:12 I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.
57阁 1:13 I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel;
57阁 1:14 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced.
57阁 1:15 Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever,
57阁 1:16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother--especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
57阁 1:17 So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57阁 1:18 If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
57阁 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self.
57阁 1:20 Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.
57阁 1:21 Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
57阁 1:22 One thing more--prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you.
57阁 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
57阁 1:24 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
57阁 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
58
58洒 1:1 Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets,
58洒 1:2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds.
58洒 1:3 He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact imprint of God's very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
58洒 1:4 having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
58洒 1:5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?
58洒 1:6 And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58洒 1:7 Of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire."
58洒 1:8 But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.
58洒 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions."
58洒 1:10 And, "In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
58洒 1:11 they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;
58洒 1:12 like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never end."
58洒 1:13 But to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
58洒 1:14 Are not all angels spirits in the divine service, sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
58洒 2:1 Therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.
58洒 2:2 For if the message declared through angels was valid, and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty,
58洒 2:3 how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was declared at first through the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him,
58洒 2:4 while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributed according to his will.
58洒 2:5 Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.
58洒 2:6 But someone has testified somewhere, "What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them?
58洒 2:7 You have made them for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned them with glory and honor,
58洒 2:8 subjecting all things under their feet." Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them,
58洒 2:9 but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58洒 2:10 It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
58洒 2:11 For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,
58洒 2:12 saying, "I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters, in the midst of the congregation I will praise you."
58洒 2:13 And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Here am I and the children whom God has given me."
58洒 2:14 Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
58洒 2:15 and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.
58洒 2:16 For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham.
58洒 2:17 Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.
58洒 2:18 Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.
58洒 3:1 Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling, consider that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
58洒 3:2 was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also "was faithful in all God's house."
58洒 3:3 Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
58洒 3:4 (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
58洒 3:5 Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later.
58洒 3:6 Christ, however, was faithful over God's house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope.
58洒 3:7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
58洒 3:8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, as on the day of testing in the wilderness,
58洒 3:9 where your ancestors put me to the test, though they had seen my works
58洒 3:10 for forty years. Therefore I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.'
58洒 3:11 As in my anger I swore, 'They will not enter my rest.'"
58洒 3:12 Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
58洒 3:13 But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
58洒 3:14 For we have become partners of Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end.
58洒 3:15 As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
58洒 3:16 Now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
58洒 3:17 But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
58洒 3:18 And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?
58洒 3:19 So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
58洒 4:1 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest is still open, let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it.
58洒 4:2 For indeed the good news came to us just as to them; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.
58洒 4:3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "As in my anger I swore, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" though his works were finished at the foundation of the world.
58洒 4:4 For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
58洒 4:5 And again in this place it says, "They shall not enter my rest."
58洒 4:6 Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
58洒 4:7 again he sets a certain day--"today"--saying through David much later, in the words already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58洒 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later about another day.
58洒 4:9 So then, a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God;
58洒 4:10 for those who enter God's rest also cease from their labors as God did from his.
58洒 4:11 Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs.
58洒 4:12 Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
58洒 4:13 And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.
58洒 4:14 Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
58洒 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin.
58洒 4:16 Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
58洒 5:1 Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58洒 5:2 He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness;
58洒 5:3 and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.
58洒 5:4 And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.
58洒 5:5 So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you";
58洒 5:6 as he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
58洒 5:7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
58洒 5:8 Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered;
58洒 5:9 and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
58洒 5:10 having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
58洒 5:11 About this we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become dull in understanding.
58洒 5:12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food;
58洒 5:13 for everyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is unskilled in the word of righteousness.
58洒 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.
58洒 6:1 Therefore let us go on toward perfection, leaving behind the basic teaching about Christ, and not laying again the foundation: repentance from dead works and faith toward God,
58洒 6:2 instruction about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58洒 6:3 And we will do this, if God permits.
58洒 6:4 For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,
58洒 6:5 and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
58洒 6:6 and then have fallen away, since on their own they are crucifying again the Son of God and are holding him up to contempt.
58洒 6:7 Ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly, and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
58洒 6:8 But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed; its end is to be burned over.
58洒 6:9 Even though we speak in this way, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that belong to salvation.
58洒 6:10 For God is not unjust; he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.
58洒 6:11 And we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end,
58洒 6:12 so that you may not become sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
58洒 6:13 When God made a promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,
58洒 6:14 saying, "I will surely bless you and multiply you."
58洒 6:15 And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.
58洒 6:16 Human beings, of course, swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute.
58洒 6:17 In the same way, when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it by an oath,
58洒 6:18 so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God would prove false, we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us.
58洒 6:19 We have this hope, a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain,
58洒 6:20 where Jesus, a forerunner on our behalf, has entered, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
58洒 7:1 This "King Melchizedek of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him";
58洒 7:2 and to him Abraham apportioned "one-tenth of everything." His name, in the first place, means "king of righteousness"; next he is also king of Salem, that is, "king of peace."
58洒 7:3 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
58洒 7:4 See how great he is! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.
58洒 7:5 And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their kindred, though these also are descended from Abraham.
58洒 7:6 But this man, who does not belong to their ancestry, collected tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises.
58洒 7:7 It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.
58洒 7:8 In the one case, tithes are received by those who are mortal; in the other, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.
58洒 7:9 One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,
58洒 7:10 for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
58洒 7:11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood--for the people received the law under this priesthood--what further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than one according to the order of Aaron?
58洒 7:12 For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
58洒 7:13 Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
58洒 7:14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58洒 7:15 It is even more obvious when another priest arises, resembling Melchizedek,
58洒 7:16 one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but through the power of an indestructible life.
58洒 7:17 For it is attested of him, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
58洒 7:18 There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual
58洒 7:19 (for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.
58洒 7:20 This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their office without an oath,
58洒 7:21 but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said to him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever'"--
58洒 7:22 accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.
58洒 7:23 Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;
58洒 7:24 but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.
58洒 7:25 Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
58洒 7:26 For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
58洒 7:27 Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself.
58洒 7:28 For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.
58洒 8:1 Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
58洒 8:2 a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord, and not any mortal, has set up.
58洒 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
58洒 8:4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
58洒 8:5 They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one; for Moses, when he was about to erect the tent, was warned, "See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain."
58洒 8:6 But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted through better promises.
58洒 8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.
58洒 8:8 God finds fault with them when he says: "The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
58洒 8:9 not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.
58洒 8:10 This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
58洒 8:11 And they shall not teach one another or say to each other, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58洒 8:12 For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more."
58洒 8:13 In speaking of "a new covenant," he has made the first one obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.
58洒 9:1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
58洒 9:2 For a tent was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place.
58洒 9:3 Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies.
58洒 9:4 In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
58洒 9:5 above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot speak now in detail.
58洒 9:6 Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties;
58洒 9:7 but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people.
58洒 9:8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing.
58洒 9:9 This is a symbol of the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
58洒 9:10 but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms, regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right.
58洒 9:11 But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation),
58洒 9:12 he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.
58洒 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified,
58洒 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!
58洒 9:15 For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.
58洒 9:16 Where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.
58洒 9:17 For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.
58洒 9:18 Hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
58洒 9:19 For when every commandment had been told to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,
58洒 9:20 saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you."
58洒 9:21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
58洒 9:22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
58洒 9:23 Thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these.
58洒 9:24 For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, a mere copy of the true one, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
58洒 9:25 Nor was it to offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Holy Place year after year with blood that is not his own;
58洒 9:26 for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58洒 9:27 And just as it is appointed for mortals to die once, and after that the judgment,
58洒 9:28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.
58洒 10:1 Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who approach.
58洒 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered, since the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?
58洒 10:3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.
58洒 10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58洒 10:5 Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;
58洒 10:6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.
58洒 10:7 Then I said, 'See, God, I have come to do your will, O God' (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)."
58洒 10:8 When he said above, "You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are offered according to the law),
58洒 10:9 then he added, "See, I have come to do your will." He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.
58洒 10:10 And it is by God's will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58洒 10:11 And every priest stands day after day at his service, offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.
58洒 10:12 But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, "he sat down at the right hand of God,"
58洒 10:13 and since then has been waiting "until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet."
58洒 10:14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
58洒 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
58洒 10:16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,"
58洒 10:17 he also adds, "I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more."
58洒 10:18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
58洒 10:19 Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
58洒 10:20 by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),
58洒 10:21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58洒 10:22 let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
58洒 10:23 Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful.
58洒 10:24 And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds,
58洒 10:25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
58洒 10:26 For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
58洒 10:27 but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
58洒 10:28 Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy "on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
58洒 10:29 How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?
58洒 10:30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58洒 10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58洒 10:32 But recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
58洒 10:33 sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
58洒 10:34 For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting.
58洒 10:35 Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward.
58洒 10:36 For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
58洒 10:37 For yet "in a very little while, the one who is coming will come and will not delay;
58洒 10:38 but my righteous one will live by faith. My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back."
58洒 10:39 But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.
58洒 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
58洒 11:2 Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval.
58洒 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.
58洒 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain's. Through this he received approval as righteous, God himself giving approval to his gifts; he died, but through his faith he still speaks.
58洒 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken so that he did not experience death; and "he was not found, because God had taken him." For it was attested before he was taken away that "he had pleased God."
58洒 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
58洒 11:7 By faith Noah, warned by God about events as yet unseen, respected the warning and built an ark to save his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith.
58洒 11:8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going.
58洒 11:9 By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
58洒 11:10 For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58洒 11:11 By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old--and Sarah herself was barren--because he considered him faithful who had promised.
58洒 11:12 Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, "as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore."
58洒 11:13 All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth,
58洒 11:14 for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
58洒 11:15 If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return.
58洒 11:16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.
58洒 11:17 By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac. He who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,
58洒 11:18 of whom he had been told, "It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you."
58洒 11:19 He considered the fact that God is able even to raise someone from the dead--and figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
58洒 11:20 By faith Isaac invoked blessings for the future on Jacob and Esau.
58洒 11:21 By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, "bowing in worship over the top of his staff."
58洒 11:22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his burial.
58洒 11:23 By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that the child was beautiful; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
58洒 11:24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,
58洒 11:25 choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58洒 11:26 He considered abuse suffered for the Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to the reward.
58洒 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, unafraid of the king's anger; for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible.
58洒 11:28 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
58洒 11:29 By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned.
58洒 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days.
58洒 11:31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.
58洒 11:32 And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets--
58洒 11:33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
58洒 11:34 quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
58洒 11:35 Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection.
58洒 11:36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.
58洒 11:37 They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented--
58洒 11:38 of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.
58洒 11:39 Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised,
58洒 11:40 since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from us, be made perfect.
58洒 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
58洒 12:2 looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.
58洒 12:3 Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.
58洒 12:4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58洒 12:5 And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children--"My child, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, or lose heart when you are punished by him;
58洒 12:6 for the Lord disciplines those whom he loves, and chastises every child whom he accepts."
58洒 12:7 Endure trials for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as children; for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline?
58洒 12:8 If you do not have that discipline in which all children share, then you are illegitimate and not his children.
58洒 12:9 Moreover, we had human parents to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not be even more willing to be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
58洒 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share his holiness.
58洒 12:11 Now, discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
58洒 12:12 Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
58洒 12:13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
58洒 12:14 Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
58洒 12:15 See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and through it many become defiled.
58洒 12:16 See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
58洒 12:17 You know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, even though he sought the blessing with tears.
58洒 12:18 You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,
58洒 12:19 and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.
58洒 12:20 (For they could not endure the order that was given, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death."
58洒 12:21 Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, "I tremble with fear.")
58洒 12:22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,
58洒 12:23 and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
58洒 12:24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58洒 12:25 See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven!
58洒 12:26 At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven."
58洒 12:27 This phrase, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of what is shaken--that is, created things--so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58洒 12:28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe;
58洒 12:29 for indeed our God is a consuming fire.
58洒 13:1 Let mutual love continue.
58洒 13:2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.
58洒 13:3 Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured.
58洒 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
58洒 13:5 Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, "I will never leave you or forsake you."
58洒 13:6 So we can say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?"
58洒 13:7 Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.
58洒 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
58洒 13:9 Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings; for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by regulations about food, which have not benefited those who observe them.
58洒 13:10 We have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat.
58洒 13:11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
58洒 13:12 Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.
58洒 13:13 Let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.
58洒 13:14 For here we have no lasting city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
58洒 13:15 Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.
58洒 13:16 Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
58洒 13:17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with sighing--for that would be harmful to you.
58洒 13:18 Pray for us; we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.
58洒 13:19 I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you very soon.
58洒 13:20 Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,
58洒 13:21 make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will, working among us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
58洒 13:22 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
58洒 13:23 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free; and if he comes in time, he will be with me when I see you.
58洒 13:24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings.
58洒 13:25 Grace be with all of you.

59距 1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.
59距 1:2 My brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kind, consider it nothing but joy,
59距 1:3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance;
59距 1:4 and let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.
59距 1:5 If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you.
59距 1:6 But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind;
59距 1:7 for the doubter, being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59距 1:8 [7例苞 窃膊 弓咯 乐澜]
59距 1:9 Let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up,
59距 1:10 and the rich in being brought low, because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field.
59距 1:11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. It is the same way with the rich; in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away.
59距 1:12 Blessed is anyone who endures temptation. Such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
59距 1:13 No one, when tempted, should say, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one.
59距 1:14 But one is tempted by one's own desire, being lured and enticed by it;
59距 1:15 then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and that sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.
59距 1:16 Do not be deceived, my beloved.
59距 1:17 Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
59距 1:18 In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
59距 1:19 You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger;
59距 1:20 for your anger does not produce God's righteousness.
59距 1:21 Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.
59距 1:22 But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.
59距 1:23 For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror;
59距 1:24 for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like.
59距 1:25 But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act--they will be blessed in their doing.
59距 1:26 If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless.
59距 1:27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
59距 2:1 My brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ?
59距 2:2 For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in,
59距 2:3 and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say, "Have a seat here, please," while to the one who is poor you say, "Stand there," or, "Sit at my feet,"
59距 2:4 have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
59距 2:5 Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters. Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?
59距 2:6 But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?
59距 2:7 Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?
59距 2:8 You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
59距 2:9 But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
59距 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.
59距 2:11 For the one who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You shall not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
59距 2:12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
59距 2:13 For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
59距 2:14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you?
59距 2:15 If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food,
59距 2:16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill," and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that?
59距 2:17 So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
59距 2:18 But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.
59距 2:19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe--and shudder.
59距 2:20 Do you want to be shown, you senseless person, that faith apart from works is barren?
59距 2:21 Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59距 2:22 You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by the works.
59距 2:23 Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness," and he was called the friend of God.
59距 2:24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
59距 2:25 Likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road?
59距 2:26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.
59距 3:1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
59距 3:2 For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle.
59距 3:3 If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies.
59距 3:4 Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
59距 3:5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!
59距 3:6 And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell.
59距 3:7 For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
59距 3:8 but no one can tame the tongue--a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59距 3:9 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God.
59距 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so.
59距 3:11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water?
59距 3:12 Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.
59距 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom.
59距 3:14 But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth.
59距 3:15 Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.
59距 3:16 For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind.
59距 3:17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.
59距 3:18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.
59距 4:1 Those conflicts and disputes among you, where do they come from? Do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you?
59距 4:2 You want something and do not have it; so you commit murder. And you covet something and cannot obtain it; so you engage in disputes and conflicts. You do not have, because you do not ask.
59距 4:3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order to spend what you get on your pleasures.
59距 4:4 Adulterers! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
59距 4:5 Or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says, "God yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"?
59距 4:6 But he gives all the more grace; therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
59距 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59距 4:8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59距 4:9 Lament and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.
59距 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
59距 4:11 Do not speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks evil against another or judges another, speaks evil against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
59距 4:12 There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. So who, then, are you to judge your neighbor?
59距 4:13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money."
59距 4:14 Yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59距 4:15 Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wishes, we will live and do this or that."
59距 4:16 As it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
59距 4:17 Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, commits sin.
59距 5:1 Come now, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you.
59距 5:2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes are moth-eaten.
59距 5:3 Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you, and it will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the last days.
59距 5:4 Listen! The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
59距 5:5 You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
59距 5:6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous one, who does not resist you.
59距 5:7 Be patient, therefore, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains.
59距 5:8 You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
59距 5:9 Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that you may not be judged. See, the Judge is standing at the doors!
59距 5:10 As an example of suffering and patience, beloved, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59距 5:11 Indeed we call blessed those who showed endurance. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
59距 5:12 Above all, my beloved, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your "Yes" be yes and your "No" be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.
59距 5:13 Are any among you suffering? They should pray. Are any cheerful? They should sing songs of praise.
59距 5:14 Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
59距 5:15 The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven.
59距 5:16 Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective.
59距 5:17 Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.
59距 5:18 Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest.
59距 5:19 My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another,
59距 5:20 you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinner's soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

60害傈 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
60害傈 1:2 who have been chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with his blood: May grace and peace be yours in abundance.
60害傈 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
60害傈 1:4 and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
60害傈 1:5 who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
60害傈 1:6 In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials,
60害傈 1:7 so that the genuineness of your faith--being more precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by fire--may be found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
60害傈 1:8 Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,
60害傈 1:9 for you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
60害傈 1:10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry,
60害傈 1:11 inquiring about the person or time that the Spirit of Christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for Christ and the subsequent glory.
60害傈 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven--things into which angels long to look!
60害傈 1:13 Therefore prepare your minds for action; discipline yourselves; set all your hope on the grace that Jesus Christ will bring you when he is revealed.
60害傈 1:14 Like obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance.
60害傈 1:15 Instead, as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;
60害傈 1:16 for it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
60害傈 1:17 If you invoke as Father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during the time of your exile.
60害傈 1:18 You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold,
60害傈 1:19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.
60害傈 1:20 He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake.
60害傈 1:21 Through him you have come to trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are set on God.
60害傈 1:22 Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart.
60害傈 1:23 You have been born anew, not of perishable but of imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God.
60害傈 1:24 For "All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls,
60害傈 1:25 but the word of the Lord endures forever." That word is the good news that was announced to you.
60害傈 2:1 Rid yourselves, therefore, of all malice, and all guile, insincerity, envy, and all slander.
60害傈 2:2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation--
60害傈 2:3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
60害傈 2:4 Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God's sight, and
60害傈 2:5 like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
60害傈 2:6 For it stands in scripture: "See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
60害傈 2:7 To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner,"
60害傈 2:8 and "A stone that makes them stumble, and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
60害傈 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
60害傈 2:10 Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
60害傈 2:11 Beloved, I urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul.
60害傈 2:12 Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that, though they malign you as evildoers, they may see your honorable deeds and glorify God when he comes to judge.
60害傈 2:13 For the Lord's sake accept the authority of every human institution, whether of the emperor as supreme,
60害傈 2:14 or of governors, as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.
60害傈 2:15 For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish.
60害傈 2:16 As servants of God, live as free people, yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil.
60害傈 2:17 Honor everyone. Love the family of believers. Fear God. Honor the emperor.
60害傈 2:18 Slaves, accept the authority of your masters with all deference, not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh.
60害傈 2:19 For it is a credit to you if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly.
60害傈 2:20 If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, what credit is that? But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God's approval.
60害傈 2:21 For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps.
60害傈 2:22 "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."
60害傈 2:23 When he was abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly.
60害傈 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.
60害傈 2:25 For you were going astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
60害傈 3:1 Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives' conduct,
60害傈 3:2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
60害傈 3:3 Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing;
60害傈 3:4 rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God's sight.
60害傈 3:5 It was in this way long ago that the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves by accepting the authority of their husbands.
60害傈 3:6 Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters as long as you do what is good and never let fears alarm you.
60害傈 3:7 Husbands, in the same way, show consideration for your wives in your life together, paying honor to the woman as the weaker sex, since they too are also heirs of the gracious gift of life--so that nothing may hinder your prayers.
60害傈 3:8 Finally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love for one another, a tender heart, and a humble mind.
60害傈 3:9 Do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse; but, on the contrary, repay with a blessing. It is for this that you were called--that you might inherit a blessing.
60害傈 3:10 For "Those who desire life and desire to see good days, let them keep their tongues from evil and their lips from speaking deceit;
60害傈 3:11 let them turn away from evil and do good; let them seek peace and pursue it.
60害傈 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
60害傈 3:13 Now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good?
60害傈 3:14 But even if you do suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, and do not be intimidated,
60害傈 3:15 but in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you;
60害傈 3:16 yet do it with gentleness and reverence. Keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.
60害傈 3:17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be God's will, than to suffer for doing evil.
60害傈 3:18 For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,
60害傈 3:19 in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison,
60害傈 3:20 who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.
60害傈 3:21 And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you--not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
60害傈 3:22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.
60害傈 4:1 Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin),
60害傈 4:2 so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God.
60害傈 4:3 You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry.
60害傈 4:4 They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme.
60害傈 4:5 But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead.
60害傈 4:6 For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.
60害傈 4:7 The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers.
60害傈 4:8 Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.
60害傈 4:9 Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
60害傈 4:10 Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received.
60害傈 4:11 Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God; whoever serves must do so with the strength that God supplies, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
60害傈 4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
60害傈 4:13 But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.
60害傈 4:14 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you.
60害傈 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even as a mischief maker.
60害傈 4:16 Yet if any of you suffers as a Christian, do not consider it a disgrace, but glorify God because you bear this name.
60害傈 4:17 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
60害傈 4:18 And "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinners?"
60害傈 4:19 Therefore, let those suffering in accordance with God's will entrust themselves to a faithful Creator, while continuing to do good.
60害傈 5:1 Now as an elder myself and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I exhort the elders among you
60害傈 5:2 to tend the flock of God that is in your charge, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion but willingly, as God would have you do it--not for sordid gain but eagerly.
60害傈 5:3 Do not lord it over those in your charge, but be examples to the flock.
60害傈 5:4 And when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades away.
60害傈 5:5 In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you must clothe yourselves with humility in your dealings with one another, for "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
60害傈 5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time.
60害傈 5:7 Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.
60害傈 5:8 Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.
60害傈 5:9 Resist him, steadfast in your faith, for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.
60害傈 5:10 And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you.
60害傈 5:11 To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.
60害傈 5:12 Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
60害傈 5:13 Your sister church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings; and so does my son Mark.
60害傈 5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61
61害饶 1:1 Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
61害饶 1:2 May grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
61害饶 1:3 His divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
61害饶 1:4 Thus he has given us, through these things, his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and may become participants of the divine nature.
61害饶 1:5 For this very reason, you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness, and goodness with knowledge,
61害饶 1:6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with endurance, and endurance with godliness,
61害饶 1:7 and godliness with mutual affection, and mutual affection with love.
61害饶 1:8 For if these things are yours and are increasing among you, they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
61害饶 1:9 For anyone who lacks these things is nearsighted and blind, and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins.
61害饶 1:10 Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more eager to confirm your call and election, for if you do this, you will never stumble.
61害饶 1:11 For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.
61害饶 1:12 Therefore I intend to keep on reminding you of these things, though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you.
61害饶 1:13 I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory,
61害饶 1:14 since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
61害饶 1:15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
61害饶 1:16 For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.
61害饶 1:17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased."
61害饶 1:18 We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.
61害饶 1:19 So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
61害饶 1:20 First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,
61害饶 1:21 because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
61害饶 2:1 But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive opinions. They will even deny the Master who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.
61害饶 2:2 Even so, many will follow their licentious ways, and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned.
61害饶 2:3 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation, pronounced against them long ago, has not been idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
61害饶 2:4 For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment;
61害饶 2:5 and if he did not spare the ancient world, even though he saved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly;
61害饶 2:6 and if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly;
61害饶 2:7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless
61害饶 2:8 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard),
61害饶 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment
61害饶 2:10 --especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust, and who despise authority. Bold and willful, they are not afraid to slander the glorious ones,
61害饶 2:11 whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring against them a slanderous judgment from the Lord.
61害饶 2:12 These people, however, are like irrational animals, mere creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed. They slander what they do not understand, and when those creatures are destroyed, they also will be destroyed,
61害饶 2:13 suffering the penalty for doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their dissipation while they feast with you.
61害饶 2:14 They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!
61害饶 2:15 They have left the straight road and have gone astray, following the road of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of doing wrong,
61害饶 2:16 but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
61害饶 2:17 These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them the deepest darkness has been reserved.
61害饶 2:18 For they speak bombastic nonsense, and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.
61害饶 2:19 They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption; for people are slaves to whatever masters them.
61害饶 2:20 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overpowered, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
61害饶 2:21 For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment that was passed on to them.
61害饶 2:22 It has happened to them according to the true proverb, "The dog turns back to its own vomit," and, "The sow is washed only to wallow in the mud."
61害饶 3:1 This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you; in them I am trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you
61害饶 3:2 that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles.
61害饶 3:3 First of all you must understand this, that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and indulging their own lusts
61害饶 3:4 and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since our ancestors died, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation!"
61害饶 3:5 They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water,
61害饶 3:6 through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished.
61害饶 3:7 But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless.
61害饶 3:8 But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day.
61害饶 3:9 The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.
61害饶 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed.
61害饶 3:11 Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness,
61害饶 3:12 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire?
61害饶 3:13 But, in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.
61害饶 3:14 Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish;
61害饶 3:15 and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation. So also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him,
61害饶 3:16 speaking of this as he does in all his letters. There are some things in them hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other scriptures.
61害饶 3:17 You therefore, beloved, since you are forewarned, beware that you are not carried away with the error of the lawless and lose your own stability.
61害饶 3:18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

62夸老 1:1 We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life--
62夸老 1:2 this life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us--
62夸老 1:3 we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
62夸老 1:4 We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
62夸老 1:5 This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all.
62夸老 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true;
62夸老 1:7 but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
62夸老 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
62夸老 1:9 If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
62夸老 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
62夸老 2:1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;
62夸老 2:2 and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.
62夸老 2:3 Now by this we may be sure that we know him, if we obey his commandments.
62夸老 2:4 Whoever says, "I have come to know him," but does not obey his commandments, is a liar, and in such a person the truth does not exist;
62夸老 2:5 but whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has reached perfection. By this we may be sure that we are in him:
62夸老 2:6 whoever says, "I abide in him," ought to walk just as he walked.
62夸老 2:7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard.
62夸老 2:8 Yet I am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
62夸老 2:9 Whoever says, "I am in the light," while hating a brother or sister, is still in the darkness.
62夸老 2:10 Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light, and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling.
62夸老 2:11 But whoever hates another believer is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has brought on blindness.
62夸老 2:12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.
62夸老 2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one.
62夸老 2:14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
62夸老 2:15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world;
62夸老 2:16 for all that is in the world--the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in riches--comes not from the Father but from the world.
62夸老 2:17 And the world and its desire are passing away, but those who do the will of God live forever.
62夸老 2:18 Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour.
62夸老 2:19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us.
62夸老 2:20 But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.
62夸老 2:21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth.
62夸老 2:22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
62夸老 2:23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the Father also.
62夸老 2:24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father.
62夸老 2:25 And this is what he has promised us, eternal life.
62夸老 2:26 I write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you.
62夸老 2:27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and so you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him.
62夸老 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming.
62夸老 2:29 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him.
62夸老 3:1 See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
62夸老 3:2 Beloved, we are God's children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is.
62夸老 3:3 And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.
62夸老 3:4 Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.
62夸老 3:5 You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
62夸老 3:6 No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.
62夸老 3:7 Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
62夸老 3:8 Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.
62夸老 3:9 Those who have been born of God do not sin, because God's seed abides in them; they cannot sin, because they have been born of God.
62夸老 3:10 The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way: all who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters.
62夸老 3:11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
62夸老 3:12 We must not be like Cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.
62夸老 3:13 Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you.
62夸老 3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love abides in death.
62夸老 3:15 All who hate a brother or sister are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them.
62夸老 3:16 We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us--and we ought to lay down our lives for one another.
62夸老 3:17 How does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?
62夸老 3:18 Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.
62夸老 3:19 And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him
62夸老 3:20 whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.
62夸老 3:21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God;
62夸老 3:22 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him.
62夸老 3:23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us.
62夸老 3:24 All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.
62夸老 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
62夸老 4:2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
62夸老 4:3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world.
62夸老 4:4 Little children, you are from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
62夸老 4:5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.
62夸老 4:6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
62夸老 4:7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
62夸老 4:8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.
62夸老 4:9 God's love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him.
62夸老 4:10 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62夸老 4:11 Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another.
62夸老 4:12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.
62夸老 4:13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
62夸老 4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world.
62夸老 4:15 God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God.
62夸老 4:16 So we have known and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them.
62夸老 4:17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world.
62夸老 4:18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love.
62夸老 4:19 We love because he first loved us.
62夸老 4:20 Those who say, "I love God," and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.
62夸老 4:21 The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.
62夸老 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child.
62夸老 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.
62夸老 5:3 For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,
62夸老 5:4 for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith.
62夸老 5:5 Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
62夸老 5:6 This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.
62夸老 5:7 There are three that testify:
62夸老 5:8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree.
62夸老 5:9 If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son.
62夸老 5:10 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
62夸老 5:11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
62夸老 5:12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
62夸老 5:13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
62夸老 5:14 And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
62夸老 5:15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.
62夸老 5:16 If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one--to those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that.
62夸老 5:17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.
62夸老 5:18 We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them.
62夸老 5:19 We know that we are God's children, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one.
62夸老 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
62夸老 5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

63夸捞 1:1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,
63夸捞 1:2 because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
63夸捞 1:3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.
63夸捞 1:4 I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.
63夸捞 1:5 But now, dear lady, I ask you, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning, let us love one another.
63夸捞 1:6 And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginning--you must walk in it.
63夸捞 1:7 Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist!
63夸捞 1:8 Be on your guard, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.
63夸捞 1:9 Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ, but goes beyond it, does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
63夸捞 1:10 Do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching;
63夸捞 1:11 for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person.
63夸捞 1:12 Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink; instead I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
63夸捞 1:13 The children of your elect sister send you their greetings.

64夸伙 1:1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
64夸伙 1:2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, just as it is well with your soul.
64夸伙 1:3 I was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth, namely how you walk in the truth.
64夸伙 1:4 I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
64夸伙 1:5 Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends, even though they are strangers to you;
64夸伙 1:6 they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God;
64夸伙 1:7 for they began their journey for the sake of Christ, accepting no support from non-believers.
64夸伙 1:8 Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may become co-workers with the truth.
64夸伙 1:9 I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority.
64夸伙 1:10 So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us. And not content with those charges, he refuses to welcome the friends, and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church.
64夸伙 1:11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
64夸伙 1:12 Everyone has testified favorably about Demetrius, and so has the truth itself. We also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.
64夸伙 1:13 I have much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink;
64夸伙 1:14 instead I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face. 
64夸伙 1:15 Peace to you. The friends send you their greetings. Greet the friends there, each by name.

65蜡 1:1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ:
65蜡 1:2 May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
65蜡 1:3 Beloved, while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share, I find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
65蜡 1:4 For certain intruders have stolen in among you, people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly, who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65蜡 1:5 Now I desire to remind you, though you are fully informed, that the Lord, who once for all saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
65蜡 1:6 And the angels who did not keep their own position, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great Day.
65蜡 1:7 Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which, in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
65蜡 1:8 Yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh, reject authority, and slander the glorious ones.
65蜡 1:9 But when the archangel Michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of Moses, he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
65蜡 1:10 But these people slander whatever they do not understand, and they are destroyed by those things that, like irrational animals, they know by instinct.
65蜡 1:11 Woe to them! For they go the way of Cain, and abandon themselves to Balaam's error for the sake of gain, and perish in Korah's rebellion.
65蜡 1:12 These are blemishes on your love-feasts, while they feast with you without fear, feeding themselves. They are waterless clouds carried along by the winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted;
65蜡 1:13 wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever.
65蜡 1:14 It was also about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, "See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones,
65蜡 1:15 to execute judgment on all, and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65蜡 1:16 These are grumblers and malcontents; they indulge their own lusts; they are bombastic in speech, flattering people to their own advantage.
65蜡 1:17 But you, beloved, must remember the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
65蜡 1:18 for they said to you, "In the last time there will be scoffers, indulging their own ungodly lusts."
65蜡 1:19 It is these worldly people, devoid of the Spirit, who are causing divisions.
65蜡 1:20 But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit;
65蜡 1:21 keep yourselves in the love of God; look forward to the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
65蜡 1:22 And have mercy on some who are wavering;
65蜡 1:23 save others by snatching them out of the fire; and have mercy on still others with fear, hating even the tunic defiled by their bodies.
65蜡 1:24 Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to make you stand without blemish in the presence of his glory with rejoicing,
65蜡 1:25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

66拌 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place; he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
66拌 1:2 who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.
66拌 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written in it; for the time is near.
66拌 1:4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
66拌 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood,
66拌 1:6 and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
66拌 1:7 Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes of the earth will wail. So it is to be. Amen.
66拌 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
66拌 1:9 I, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66拌 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
66拌 1:11 saying, "Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
66拌 1:12 Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands,
66拌 1:13 and in the midst of the lampstands I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest.
66拌 1:14 His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire,
66拌 1:15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.
66拌 1:16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force.
66拌 1:17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right hand on me, saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,
66拌 1:18 and the living one. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever; and I have the keys of Death and of Hades.
66拌 1:19 Now write what you have seen, what is, and what is to take place after this.
66拌 1:20 As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66拌 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands:
66拌 2:2 "I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance. I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers; you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them to be false.
66拌 2:3 I also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name, and that you have not grown weary.
66拌 2:4 But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.
66拌 2:5 Remember then from what you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
66拌 2:6 Yet this is to your credit: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66拌 2:7 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To everyone who conquers, I will give permission to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.
66拌 2:8 "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of the first and the last, who was dead and came to life:
66拌 2:9 "I know your affliction and your poverty, even though you are rich. I know the slander on the part of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66拌 2:10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Beware, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have affliction. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66拌 2:11 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death.
66拌 2:12 "And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword:
66拌 2:13 "I know where you are living, where Satan's throne is. Yet you are holding fast to my name, and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.
66拌 2:14 But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel, so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice fornication.
66拌 2:15 So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66拌 2:16 Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
66拌 2:17 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To everyone who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give a white stone, and on the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.
66拌 2:18 "And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze:
66拌 2:19 "I know your works--your love, faith, service, and patient endurance. I know that your last works are greater than the first.
66拌 2:20 But I have this against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
66拌 2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her fornication.
66拌 2:22 Beware, I am throwing her on a bed, and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great distress, unless they repent of her doings;
66拌 2:23 and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve.
66拌 2:24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call 'the deep things of Satan,' to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden;
66拌 2:25 only hold fast to what you have until I come.
66拌 2:26 To everyone who conquers and continues to do my works to the end, I will give authority over the nations;
66拌 2:27 to rule them with an iron rod, as when clay pots are shattered--
66拌 2:28 even as I also received authority from my Father. To the one who conquers I will also give the morning star.
66拌 2:29 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
66拌 3:1 "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: "I know your works; you have a name of being alive, but you are dead.
66拌 3:2 Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God.
66拌 3:3 Remember then what you received and heard; obey it, and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.
66拌 3:4 Yet you have still a few persons in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; they will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
66拌 3:5 If you conquer, you will be clothed like them in white robes, and I will not blot your name out of the book of life; I will confess your name before my Father and before his angels.
66拌 3:6 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
66拌 3:7 "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens:
66拌 3:8 "I know your works. Look, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66拌 3:9 I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but are lying--I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you.
66拌 3:10 Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
66拌 3:11 I am coming soon; hold fast to what you have, so that no one may seize your crown.
66拌 3:12 If you conquer, I will make you a pillar in the temple of my God; you will never go out of it. I will write on you the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.
66拌 3:13 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
66拌 3:14 "And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the origin of God's creation:
66拌 3:15 "I know your works; you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot.
66拌 3:16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66拌 3:17 For you say, 'I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing.' You do not realize that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.
66拌 3:18 Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich; and white robes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nakedness from being seen; and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.
66拌 3:19 I reprove and discipline those whom I love. Be earnest, therefore, and repent.
66拌 3:20 Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me.
66拌 3:21 To the one who conquers I will give a place with me on my throne, just as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66拌 3:22 Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches."
66拌 4:1 After this I looked, and there in heaven a door stood open! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."
66拌 4:2 At once I was in the spirit, and there in heaven stood a throne, with one seated on the throne!
66拌 4:3 And the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian, and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald.
66拌 4:4 Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads.
66拌 4:5 Coming from the throne are flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God;
66拌 4:6 and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass, like crystal. Around the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind:
66拌 4:7 the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with a face like a human face, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.
66拌 4:8 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and inside. Day and night without ceasing they sing, "Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God the Almighty, who was and is and is to come."
66拌 4:9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
66拌 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne, singing,
66拌 4:11 "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."
66拌 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals;
66拌 5:2 and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"
66拌 5:3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.
66拌 5:4 And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
66拌 5:5 Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."
66拌 5:6 Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66拌 5:7 He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.
66拌 5:8 When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66拌 5:9 They sing a new song: "You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for God saints from every tribe and language and people and nation;
66拌 5:10 you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our God, and they will reign on earth."
66拌 5:11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
66拌 5:12 singing with full voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!"
66拌 5:13 Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing, "To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!"
66拌 5:14 And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" And the elders fell down and worshiped.
66拌 6:1 Then I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures call out, as with a voice of thunder, "Come!"
66拌 6:2 I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow; a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering and to conquer.
66拌 6:3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, "Come!"
66拌 6:4 And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another; and he was given a great sword.
66拌 6:5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, "Come!" I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand,
66拌 6:6 and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a day's pay, and three quarts of barley for a day's pay, but do not damage the olive oil and the wine!"
66拌 6:7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out, "Come!"
66拌 6:8 I looked and there was a pale green horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed with him; they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the wild animals of the earth.
66拌 6:9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of God and for the testimony they had given;
66拌 6:10 they cried out with a loud voice, "Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?"
66拌 6:11 They were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number would be complete both of their fellow servants and of their brothers and sisters, who were soon to be killed as they themselves had been killed.
66拌 6:12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and there came a great earthquake; the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,
66拌 6:13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
66拌 6:14 The sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
66拌 6:15 Then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,
66拌 6:16 calling to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;
66拌 6:17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"
66拌 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree.
66拌 7:2 I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea,
66拌 7:3 saying, "Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads."
66拌 7:4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the people of Israel:
66拌 7:5 From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
66拌 7:6 from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
66拌 7:7 from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
66拌 7:8 from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed.
66拌 7:9 After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands.
66拌 7:10 They cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
66拌 7:11 And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66拌 7:12 singing, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen."
66拌 7:13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?"
66拌 7:14 I said to him, "Sir, you are the one that knows." Then he said to me, "These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66拌 7:15 For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.
66拌 7:16 They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;
66拌 7:17 for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66拌 8:1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66拌 8:2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
66拌 8:3 Another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar; he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that is before the throne.
66拌 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
66拌 8:5 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
66拌 8:6 Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them.
66拌 8:7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
66拌 8:8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea.
66拌 8:9 A third of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66拌 8:10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
66拌 8:11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter.
66拌 8:12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened; a third of the day was kept from shining, and likewise the night.
66拌 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew in midheaven, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!"
66拌 9:1 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit;
66拌 9:2 he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
66拌 9:3 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth.
66拌 9:4 They were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66拌 9:5 They were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone.
66拌 9:6 And in those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.
66拌 9:7 In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,
66拌 9:8 their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth;
66拌 9:9 they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
66拌 9:10 They have tails like scorpions, with stingers, and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months.
66拌 9:11 They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.
66拌 9:12 The first woe has passed. There are still two woes to come.
66拌 9:13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,
66拌 9:14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66拌 9:15 So the four angels were released, who had been held ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, to kill a third of humankind.
66拌 9:16 The number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million; I heard their number.
66拌 9:17 And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur; the heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.
66拌 9:18 By these three plagues a third of humankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.
66拌 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they inflict harm.
66拌 9:20 The rest of humankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.
66拌 9:21 And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts.
66拌 10:1 And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.
66拌 10:2 He held a little scroll open in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
66拌 10:3 he gave a great shout, like a lion roaring. And when he shouted, the seven thunders sounded.
66拌 10:4 And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down."
66拌 10:5 Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven
66拌 10:6 and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: "There will be no more delay,
66拌 10:7 but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he announced to his servants the prophets."
66拌 10:8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66拌 10:9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, "Take it, and eat; it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth."
66拌 10:10 So I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
66拌 10:11 Then they said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings."
66拌 11:1 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, "Come and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
66拌 11:2 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months.
66拌 11:3 And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, wearing sackcloth."
66拌 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66拌 11:5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes; anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner.
66拌 11:6 They have authority to shut the sky, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire.
66拌 11:7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,
66拌 11:8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66拌 11:9 For three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb;
66拌 11:10 and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth.
66拌 11:11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified.
66拌 11:12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them.
66拌 11:13 At that moment there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66拌 11:14 The second woe has passed. The third woe is coming very soon.
66拌 11:15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign forever and ever."
66拌 11:16 Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66拌 11:17 singing, "We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty, who are and who were, for you have taken your great power and begun to reign.
66拌 11:18 The nations raged, but your wrath has come, and the time for judging the dead, for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints and all who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying those who destroy the earth."
66拌 11:19 Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
66拌 12:1 A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
66拌 12:2 She was pregnant and was crying out in birthpangs, in the agony of giving birth.
66拌 12:3 Then another portent appeared in heaven: a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.
66拌 12:4 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born.
66拌 12:5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne;
66拌 12:6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days.
66拌 12:7 And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back,
66拌 12:8 but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
66拌 12:9 The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world--he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
66拌 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah, for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.
66拌 12:11 But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.
66拌 12:12 Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"
66拌 12:13 So when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66拌 12:14 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.
66拌 12:15 Then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood.
66拌 12:16 But the earth came to the help of the woman; it opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
66拌 12:17 Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her children, those who keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus. Then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.
66拌 13:1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea; and on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.
66拌 13:2 And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority.
66拌 13:3 One of its heads seemed to have received a death-blow, but its mortal wound had been healed. In amazement the whole earth followed the beast.
66拌 13:4 They worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?"
66拌 13:5 The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.
66拌 13:6 It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.
66拌 13:7 Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. It was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation,
66拌 13:8 and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slaughtered.
66拌 13:9 Let anyone who has an ear listen:
66拌 13:10 If you are to be taken captive, into captivity you go; if you kill with the sword, with the sword you must be killed. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.
66拌 13:11 Then I saw another beast that rose out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.
66拌 13:12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.
66拌 13:13 It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all;
66拌 13:14 and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast, it deceives the inhabitants of earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived;
66拌 13:15 and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
66拌 13:16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,
66拌 13:17 so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
66拌 13:18 This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six.
66拌 14:1 Then I looked, and there was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion! And with him were one hundred forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66拌 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps,
66拌 14:3 and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who have been redeemed from the earth.
66拌 14:4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; these follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb,
66拌 14:5 and in their mouth no lie was found; they are blameless.
66拌 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth--to every nation and tribe and language and people.
66拌 14:7 He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water."
66拌 14:8 Then another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
66拌 14:9 Then another angel, a third, followed them, crying with a loud voice, "Those who worship the beast and its image, and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands,
66拌 14:10 they will also drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
66拌 14:11 And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name."
66拌 14:12 Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.
66拌 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who from now on die in the Lord." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them."
66拌 14:14 Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the Son of Man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand!
66拌 14:15 Another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, "Use your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."
66拌 14:16 So the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.
66拌 14:17 Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
66拌 14:18 Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe."
66拌 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.
66拌 14:20 And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse's bridle, for a distance of about two hundred miles.
66拌 15:1 Then I saw another portent in heaven, great and amazing: seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is ended.
66拌 15:2 And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.
66拌 15:3 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: "Great and amazing are your deeds, Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, King of the nations!
66拌 15:4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have been revealed."
66拌 15:5 After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,
66拌 15:6 and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, with golden sashes across their chests.
66拌 15:7 Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever;
66拌 15:8 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.
66拌 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
66拌 16:2 So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth, and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image.
66拌 16:3 The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing in the sea died.
66拌 16:4 The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
66拌 16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are just, O Holy One, who are and were, for you have judged these things;
66拌 16:6 because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!"
66拌 16:7 And I heard the altar respond, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true and just!"
66拌 16:8 The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch them with fire;
66拌 16:9 they were scorched by the fierce heat, but they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory.
66拌 16:10 The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness; people gnawed their tongues in agony,
66拌 16:11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores, and they did not repent of their deeds.
66拌 16:12 The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66拌 16:13 And I saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon, from the mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet.
66拌 16:14 These are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.
66拌 16:15 ("See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed, not going about naked and exposed to shame.")
66拌 16:16 And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Harmagedon.
66拌 16:17 The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
66拌 16:18 And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a violent earthquake, such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth, so violent was that earthquake.
66拌 16:19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered great Babylon and gave her the wine-cup of the fury of his wrath.
66拌 16:20 And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found;
66拌 16:21 and huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, dropped from heaven on people, until they cursed God for the plague of the hail, so fearful was that plague.
66拌 17:1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great whore who is seated on many waters,
66拌 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and with the wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk."
66拌 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.
66拌 17:4 The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication;
66拌 17:5 and on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: "Babylon the great, mother of whores and of earth's abominations."
66拌 17:6 And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly amazed.
66拌 17:7 But the angel said to me, "Why are you so amazed? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
66拌 17:8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be amazed when they see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come.
66拌 17:9 "This calls for a mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; also, they are seven kings,
66拌 17:10 of whom five have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a little while.
66拌 17:11 As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.
66拌 17:12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.
66拌 17:13 These are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast;
66拌 17:14 they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful."
66拌 17:15 And he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the whore is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.
66拌 17:16 And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the whore; they will make her desolate and naked; they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.
66拌 17:17 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.
66拌 17:18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."
66拌 18:1 After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was made bright with his splendor.
66拌 18:2 He called out with a mighty voice, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! It has become a dwelling place of demons, a haunt of every foul and hateful bird, a haunt of every foul and hateful beast.
66拌 18:3 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxury."
66拌 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you do not take part in her sins, and so that you do not share in her plagues;
66拌 18:5 for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
66拌 18:6 Render to her as she herself has rendered, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed.
66拌 18:7 As she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so give her a like measure of torment and grief. Since in her heart she says, 'I rule as a queen; I am no widow, and I will never see grief,'
66拌 18:8 therefore her plagues will come in a single day--pestilence and mourning and famine--and she will be burned with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."
66拌 18:9 And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;
66拌 18:10 they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, "Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come."
66拌 18:11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,
66拌 18:12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels and pearls, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, all articles of ivory, all articles of costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble,
66拌 18:13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, choice flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, slaves--and human lives.
66拌 18:14 "The fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you, and all your dainties and your splendor are lost to you, never to be found again!"
66拌 18:15 The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
66拌 18:16 "Alas, alas, the great city, clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!
66拌 18:17 For in one hour all this wealth has been laid waste!" And all shipmasters and seafarers, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off
66拌 18:18 and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, "What city was like the great city?"
66拌 18:19 And they threw dust on their heads, as they wept and mourned, crying out, "Alas, alas, the great city, where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth! For in one hour she has been laid waste.
66拌 18:20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints and apostles and prophets! For God has given judgment for you against her."
66拌 18:21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "With such violence Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and will be found no more;
66拌 18:22 and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters will be heard in you no more; and an artisan of any trade will be found in you no more; and the sound of the millstone will be heard in you no more;
66拌 18:23 and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more; and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more; for your merchants were the magnates of the earth, and all nations were deceived by your sorcery.
66拌 18:24 And in you was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slaughtered on earth."
66拌 19:1 After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power to our God,
66拌 19:2 for his judgments are true and just; he has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants."
66拌 19:3 Once more they said, "Hallelujah! The smoke goes up from her forever and ever."
66拌 19:4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!"
66拌 19:5 And from the throne came a voice saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, and all who fear him, small and great."
66拌 19:6 Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying out, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.
66拌 19:7 Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready;
66拌 19:8 to her it has been granted to be clothed with fine linen, bright and pure"--for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
66拌 19:9 And the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These are true words of God."
66拌 19:10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66拌 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse! Its rider is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
66拌 19:12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name inscribed that no one knows but himself.
66拌 19:13 He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word of God.
66拌 19:14 And the armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses.
66拌 19:15 From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
66拌 19:16 On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed, "King of kings and Lord of lords."
66拌 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven, "Come, gather for the great supper of God,
66拌 19:18 to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and their riders--flesh of all, both free and slave, both small and great."
66拌 19:19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against the rider on the horse and against his army.
66拌 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed in its presence the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
66拌 19:21 And the rest were killed by the sword of the rider on the horse, the sword that came from his mouth; and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
66拌 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain.
66拌 20:2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
66拌 20:3 and threw him into the pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let out for a little while.
66拌 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
66拌 20:5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
66拌 20:6 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years.
66拌 20:7 When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison
66拌 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, in order to gather them for battle; they are as numerous as the sands of the sea.
66拌 20:9 They marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
66拌 20:10 And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66拌 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it; the earth and the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.
66拌 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, the book of life. And the dead were judged according to their works, as recorded in the books.
66拌 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done.
66拌 20:14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire;
66拌 20:15 and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
66拌 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
66拌 21:2 And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
66拌 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them;
66拌 21:4 he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away."
66拌 21:5 And the one who was seated on the throne said, "See, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true."
66拌 21:6 Then he said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.
66拌 21:7 Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be my children.
66拌 21:8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, the murderers, the fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."
66拌 21:9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66拌 21:10 And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.
66拌 21:11 It has the glory of God and a radiance like a very rare jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal.
66拌 21:12 It has a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites;
66拌 21:13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
66拌 21:14 And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66拌 21:15 The angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.
66拌 21:16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width; and he measured the city with his rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.
66拌 21:17 He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits by human measurement, which the angel was using.
66拌 21:18 The wall is built of jasper, while the city is pure gold, clear as glass.
66拌 21:19 The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66拌 21:20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
66拌 21:21 And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each of the gates is a single pearl, and the street of the city is pure gold, transparent as glass.
66拌 21:22 I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
66拌 21:23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
66拌 21:24 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
66拌 21:25 Its gates will never be shut by day--and there will be no night there.
66拌 21:26 People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
66拌 21:27 But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66拌 22:1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66拌 22:2 through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river, is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
66拌 22:3 Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him;
66拌 22:4 they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66拌 22:5 And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.
66拌 22:6 And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place."
66拌 22:7 "See, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."
66拌 22:8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me;
66拌 22:9 but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"
66拌 22:10 And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
66拌 22:11 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy."
66拌 22:12 "See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone's work.
66拌 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
66拌 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.
66拌 22:15 Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66拌 22:16 "It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star."
66拌 22:17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let everyone who hears say, "Come." And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift.
66拌 22:18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book;
66拌 22:19 if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away that person's share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
66拌 22:20 The one who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
66拌 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
