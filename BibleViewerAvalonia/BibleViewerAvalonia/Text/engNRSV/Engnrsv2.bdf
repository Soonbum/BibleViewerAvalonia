05重 1:1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan--in the wilderness, on the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
05重 1:2 (By the way of Mount Seir it takes eleven days to reach Kadesh-barnea from Horeb.)
05重 1:3 In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites just as the LORD had commanded him to speak to them.
05重 1:4 This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.
05重 1:5 Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law as follows:
05重 1:6 The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
05重 1:7 Resume your journey, and go into the hill country of the Amorites as well as into the neighboring regions--the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah, the Negeb, and the seacoast--the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
05重 1:8 See, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land that I swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them."
05重 1:9 At that time I said to you, "I am unable by myself to bear you.
05重 1:10 The LORD your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars of heaven.
05重 1:11 May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more and bless you, as he has promised you!
05重 1:12 But how can I bear the heavy burden of your disputes all by myself?
05重 1:13 Choose for each of your tribes individuals who are wise, discerning, and reputable to be your leaders."
05重 1:14 You answered me, "The plan you have proposed is a good one."
05重 1:15 So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and reputable individuals, and installed them as leaders over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officials, throughout your tribes.
05重 1:16 I charged your judges at that time: "Give the members of your community a fair hearing, and judge rightly between one person and another, whether citizen or resident alien.
05重 1:17 You must not be partial in judging: hear out the small and the great alike; you shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's. Any case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it."
05重 1:18 So I charged you at that time with all the things that you should do.
05重 1:19 Then, just as the LORD our God had ordered us, we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, until we reached Kadesh-barnea.
05重 1:20 I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
05重 1:21 See, the LORD your God has given the land to you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has promised you; do not fear or be dismayed."
05重 1:22 All of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to."
05重 1:23 The plan seemed good to me, and I selected twelve of you, one from each tribe.
05重 1:24 They set out and went up into the hill country, and when they reached the Valley of Eshcol they spied it out
05重 1:25 and gathered some of the land's produce, which they brought down to us. They brought back a report to us, and said, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us."
05重 1:26 But you were unwilling to go up. You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;
05重 1:27 you grumbled in your tents and said, "It is because the LORD hates us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to destroy us.
05重 1:28 Where are we headed? Our kindred have made our hearts melt by reporting, 'The people are stronger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified up to heaven! We actually saw there the offspring of the Anakim!' "
05重 1:29 I said to you, "Have no dread or fear of them.
05重 1:30 The LORD your God, who goes before you, is the one who will fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,
05重 1:31 and in the wilderness, where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as one carries a child, all the way that you traveled until you reached this place.
05重 1:32 But in spite of this, you have no trust in the LORD your God,
05重 1:33 who goes before you on the way to seek out a place for you to camp, in fire by night, and in the cloud by day, to show you the route you should take."
05重 1:34 When the LORD heard your words, he was wrathful and swore:
05重 1:35 "Not one of these--not one of this evil generation--shall see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,
05重 1:36 except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his descendants I will give the land on which he set foot, because of his complete fidelity to the LORD."
05重 1:37 Even with me the LORD was angry on your account, saying, "You also shall not enter there.
05重 1:38 Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, shall enter there; encourage him, for he is the one who will secure Israel's possession of it.
05重 1:39 And as for your little ones, who you thought would become booty, your children, who today do not yet know right from wrong, they shall enter there; to them I will give it, and they shall take possession of it.
05重 1:40 But as for you, journey back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea."
05重 1:41 You answered me, "We have sinned against the LORD! We are ready to go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us." So all of you strapped on your battle gear, and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.
05重 1:42 The LORD said to me, "Say to them, 'Do not go up and do not fight, for I am not in the midst of you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.'"
05重 1:43 Although I told you, you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
05重 1:44 The Amorites who lived in that hill country then came out against you and chased you as bees do. They beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
05重 1:45 When you returned and wept before the LORD, the LORD would neither heed your voice nor pay you any attention.
05重 1:46 After you had stayed at Kadesh as many days as you did,
05重 2:1 we journeyed back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD had told me and skirted Mount Seir for many days.
05重 2:2 Then the LORD said to me:
05重 2:3 "You have been skirting this hill country long enough. Head north,
05重 2:4 and charge the people as follows: You are about to pass through the territory of your kindred, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so, be very careful
05重 2:5 not to engage in battle with them, for I will not give you even so much as a foot's length of their land, since I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
05重 2:6 You shall purchase food from them for money, so that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them for money, so that you may drink.
05重 2:7 Surely the LORD your God has blessed you in all your undertakings; he knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing."
05重 2:8 So we passed by our kin, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, leaving behind the route of the Arabah, and leaving behind Elath and Ezion-geber. When we had headed out along the route of the wilderness of Moab,
05重 2:9 the LORD said to me: "Do not harass Moab or engage them in battle, for I will not give you any of its land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot."
05重 2:10 (The Emim--a large and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim--had formerly inhabited it.
05重 2:11 Like the Anakim, they are usually reckoned as Rephaim, though the Moabites call them Emim.
05重 2:12 Moreover, the Horim had formerly inhabited Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, destroying them and settling in their place, as Israel has done in the land that the LORD gave them as a possession.)
05重 2:13 "Now then, proceed to cross over the Wadi Zered." So we crossed over the Wadi Zered.
05重 2:14 And the length of time we had traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn concerning them.
05重 2:15 Indeed, the LORD's own hand was against them, to root them out from the camp, until all had perished.
05重 2:16 Just as soon as all the warriors had died off from among the people,
05重 2:17 the LORD spoke to me, saying,
05重 2:18 "Today you are going to cross the boundary of Moab at Ar.
05重 2:19 When you approach the frontier of the Ammonites, do not harass them or engage them in battle, for I will not give the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot."
05重 2:20 (It also is usually reckoned as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly inhabited it, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
05重 2:21 a strong and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place.
05重 2:22 He did the same for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by destroying the Horim before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place even to this day.
05重 2:23 As for the Avvim, who had lived in settlements in the vicinity of Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
05重 2:24 "Proceed on your journey and cross the Wadi Arnon. See, I have handed over to you King Sihon the Amorite of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession by engaging him in battle.
05重 2:25 This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven; when they hear report of you, they will tremble and be in anguish because of you."
05重 2:26 So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following terms of peace:
05重 2:27 "If you let me pass through your land, I will travel only along the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.
05重 2:28 You shall sell me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot--
05重 2:29 just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir have done for me and likewise the Moabites who live in Ar--until I cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving us."
05重 2:30 But King Sihon of Heshbon was not willing to let us pass through, for the LORD your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart defiant in order to hand him over to you, as he has now done.
05重 2:31 The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to take possession of his land."
05重 2:32 So when Sihon came out against us, he and all his people for battle at Jahaz,
05重 2:33 the LORD our God gave him over to us; and we struck him down, along with his offspring and all his people.
05重 2:34 At that time we captured all his towns, and in each town we utterly destroyed men, women, and children. We left not a single survivor.
05重 2:35 Only the livestock we kept as spoil for ourselves, as well as the plunder of the towns that we had captured.
05重 2:36 From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon (including the town that is in the wadi itself) as far as Gilead, there was no citadel too high for us. The LORD our God gave everything to us.
05重 2:37 You did not encroach, however, on the land of the Ammonites, avoiding the whole upper region of the Wadi Jabbok as well as the towns of the hill country, just as the LORD our God had charged.
05重 3:1 When we headed up the road to Bashan, King Og of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.
05重 3:2 The LORD said to me, "Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, along with his people and his land. Do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
05重 3:3 So the LORD our God also handed over to us King Og of Bashan and all his people. We struck him down until not a single survivor was left.
05重 3:4 At that time we captured all his towns; there was no citadel that we did not take from them--sixty towns, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05重 3:5 All these were fortress towns with high walls, double gates, and bars, besides a great many villages.
05重 3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, in each city utterly destroying men, women, and children.
05重 3:7 But all the livestock and the plunder of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.
05重 3:8 So at that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land beyond the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon
05重 3:9 (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),
05重 3:10 all the towns of the tableland, the whole of Gilead, and all of Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
05重 3:11 (Now only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. In fact his bed, an iron bed, can still be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites. By the common cubit it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide.)
05重 3:12 As for the land that we took possession of at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the territory north of Aroer, that is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as well as half the hill country of Gilead with its towns,
05重 3:13 and I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, Og's kingdom. (The whole region of Argob: all that portion of Bashan used to be called a land of Rephaim;
05重 3:14 Jair the Manassite acquired the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he named them--that is, Bashan--after himself, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
05重 3:15 To Machir I gave Gilead.
05重 3:16 And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Wadi Arnon, with the middle of the wadi as a boundary, and up to the Jabbok, the wadi being boundary of the Ammonites;
05重 3:17 the Arabah also, with the Jordan and its banks, from Chinnereth down to the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, with the lower slopes of Pisgah on the east.
05重 3:18 At that time, I charged you as follows: "Although the LORD your God has given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the vanguard of your Israelite kin.
05重 3:19 Only your wives, your children, and your livestock--I know that you have much livestock--shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you.
05重 3:20 When the LORD gives rest to your kindred, as to you, and they too have occupied the land that the LORD your God is giving them beyond the Jordan, then each of you may return to the property that I have given to you."
05重 3:21 And I charged Joshua as well at that time, saying: "Your own eyes have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD will do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.
05重 3:22 Do not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you."
05重 3:23 At that time, too, I entreated the LORD, saying:
05重 3:24 "O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your might; what god in heaven or on earth can perform deeds and mighty acts like yours!
05重 3:25 Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon."
05重 3:26 But the LORD was angry with me on your account and would not heed me. The LORD said to me, "Enough from you! Never speak to me of this matter again!
05重 3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
05重 3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because it is he who shall cross over at the head of this people and who shall secure their possession of the land that you will see."
05重 3:29 So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
05重 4:1 So now, Israel, give heed to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
05重 4:2 You must neither add anything to what I command you nor take away anything from it, but keep the commandments of the LORD your God with which I am charging you.
05重 4:3 You have seen for yourselves what the LORD did with regard to the Baal of Peor--how the LORD your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,
05重 4:4 while those of you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today.
05重 4:5 See, just as the LORD my God has charged me, I now teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.
05重 4:6 You must observe them diligently, for this will show your wisdom and discernment to the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people!"
05重 4:7 For what other great nation has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is whenever we call to him?
05重 4:8 And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am setting before you today?
05重 4:9 But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the days of your life; make them known to your children and your children's children--
05重 4:10 how you once stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, "Assemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their children so";
05重 4:11 you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain was blazing up to the very heavens, shrouded in dark clouds.
05重 4:12 Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
05重 4:13 He declared to you his covenant, which he charged you to observe, that is, the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two stone tablets.
05重 4:14 And the LORD charged me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.
05重 4:15 Since you saw no form when the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely,
05重 4:16 so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figure--the likeness of male or female,
05重 4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,
05重 4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
05重 4:19 And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven.
05重 4:20 But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now.
05重 4:21 The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving for your possession.
05重 4:22 For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land.
05重 4:23 So be careful not to forget the covenant that the LORD your God made with you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you.
05重 4:24 For the LORD your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
05重 4:25 When you have had children and children's children, and become complacent in the land, if you act corruptly by making an idol in the form of anything, thus doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, and provoking him to anger,
05重 4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to occupy; you will not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed.
05重 4:27 The LORD will scatter you among the peoples; only a few of you will be left among the nations where the LORD will lead you.
05重 4:28 There you will serve other gods made by human hands, objects of wood and stone that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
05重 4:29 From there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and soul.
05重 4:30 In your distress, when all these things have happened to you in time to come, you will return to the LORD your God and heed him.
05重 4:31 Because the LORD your God is a merciful God, he will neither abandon you nor destroy you; he will not forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them.
05重 4:32 For ask now about former ages, long before your own, ever since the day that God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of heaven to the other: has anything so great as this ever happened or has its like ever been heard of?
05重 4:33 Has any people ever heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as you have heard, and lived?
05重 4:34 Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by terrifying displays of power, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
05重 4:35 To you it was shown so that you would acknowledge that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him.
05重 4:36 From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, while you heard his words coming out of the fire.
05重 4:37 And because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after them. He brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,
05重 4:38 driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, giving you their land for a possession, as it is still today.
05重 4:39 So acknowledge today and take to heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
05重 4:40 Keep his statutes and his commandments, which I am commanding you today for your own well-being and that of your descendants after you, so that you may long remain in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time.
05重 4:41 Then Moses set apart on the east side of the Jordan three cities
05重 4:42 to which a homicide could flee, someone who unintentionally kills another person, the two not having been at enmity before; the homicide could flee to one of these cities and live:
05重 4:43 Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites.
05重 4:44 This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.
05重 4:45 These are the decrees and the statutes and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites when they had come out of Egypt,
05重 4:46 beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated when they came out of Egypt.
05重 4:47 They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan:
05重 4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),
05重 4:49 together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
05重 5:1 Moses convened all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances that I am addressing to you today; you shall learn them and observe them diligently.
05重 5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
05重 5:3 Not with our ancestors did the LORD make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today.
05重 5:4 The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the fire.
05重 5:5 (At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to declare to you the words of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:
05重 5:6 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;
05重 5:7 you shall have no other gods before me.
05重 5:8 You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
05重 5:9 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me,
05重 5:10 but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.
05重 5:11 You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.
05重 5:12 Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.
05重 5:13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
05重 5:14 But the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work--you, or your son or your daughter, or your male or female slave, or your ox or your donkey, or any of your livestock, or the resident alien in your towns, so that your male and female slave may rest as well as you.
05重 5:15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.
05重 5:16 Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God commanded you, so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 5:17 You shall not murder.
05重 5:18 Neither shall you commit adultery.
05重 5:19 Neither shall you steal.
05重 5:20 Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.
05重 5:21 Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, or field, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
05重 5:22 These words the LORD spoke with a loud voice to your whole assembly at the mountain, out of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, and he added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.
05重 5:23 When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you approached me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders;
05重 5:24 and you said, "Look, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that God may speak to someone and the person may still live.
05重 5:25 So now why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, we shall die.
05重 5:26 For who is there of all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and remained alive?
05重 5:27 Go near, you yourself, and hear all that the LORD our God will say. Then tell us everything that the LORD our God tells you, and we will listen and do it."
05重 5:28 The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me: "I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you; they are right in all that they have spoken.
05重 5:29 If only they had such a mind as this, to fear me and to keep all my commandments always, so that it might go well with them and with their children forever!
05重 5:30 Go say to them, 'Return to your tents.'
05重 5:31 But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, the statutes and the ordinances, that you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess."
05重 5:32 You must therefore be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn to the right or to the left.
05重 5:33 You must follow exactly the path that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you are to possess.
05重 6:1 Now this is the commandment--the statutes and the ordinances--that the LORD your God charged me to teach you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy,
05重 6:2 so that you and your children and your children's children, may fear the LORD your God all the days of your life, and keep all his decrees and his commandments that I am commanding you, so that your days may be long.
05重 6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe them diligently, so that it may go well with you, and so that you may multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has promised you.
05重 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD alone.
05重 6:5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.
05重 6:6 Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart.
05重 6:7 Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.
05重 6:8 Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead,
05重 6:9 and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
05重 6:10 When the LORD your God has brought you into the land that he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you--a land with fine, large cities that you did not build,
05重 6:11 houses filled with all sorts of goods that you did not fill, hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant--and when you have eaten your fill,
05重 6:12 take care that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 6:13 The LORD your God you shall fear; him you shall serve, and by his name alone you shall swear.
05重 6:14 Do not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who are all around you,
05重 6:15 because the LORD your God, who is present with you, is a jealous God. The anger of the LORD your God would be kindled against you and he would destroy you from the face of the earth.
05重 6:16 Do not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.
05重 6:17 You must diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his decrees, and his statutes that he has commanded you.
05重 6:18 Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, so that it may go well with you, and so that you may go in and occupy the good land that the LORD swore to your ancestors to give you,
05重 6:19 thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has promised.
05重 6:20 When your children ask you in time to come, "What is the meaning of the decrees and the statutes and the ordinances that the LORD our God has commanded you?"
05重 6:21 then you shall say to your children, "We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05重 6:22 The LORD displayed before our eyes great and awesome signs and wonders against Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his household.
05重 6:23 He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land that he promised on oath to our ancestors.
05重 6:24 Then the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our lasting good, so as to keep us alive, as is now the case.
05重 6:25 If we diligently observe this entire commandment before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us, we will be in the right."
05重 7:1 When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are about to enter and occupy, and he clears away many nations before you--the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations mightier and more numerous than you--
05重 7:2 and when the LORD your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then you must utterly destroy them. Make no covenant with them and show them no mercy.
05重 7:3 Do not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,
05重 7:4 for that would turn away your children from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
05重 7:5 But this is how you must deal with them: break down their altars, smash their pillars, hew down their sacred poles, and burn their idols with fire.
05重 7:6 For you are a people holy to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.
05重 7:7 It was not because you were more numerous than any other people that the LORD set his heart on you and chose you--for you were the fewest of all peoples.
05重 7:8 It was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath that he swore to your ancestors, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05重 7:9 Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who maintains covenant loyalty with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,
05重 7:10 and who repays in their own person those who reject him. He does not delay but repays in their own person those who reject him.
05重 7:11 Therefore, observe diligently the commandment--the statutes, and the ordinances--that I am commanding you today.
05重 7:12 If you heed these ordinances, by diligently observing them, the LORD your God will maintain with you the covenant loyalty that he swore to your ancestors;
05重 7:13 he will love you, bless you, and multiply you; he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock, in the land that he swore to your ancestors to give you.
05重 7:14 You shall be the most blessed of peoples, with neither sterility nor barrenness among you or your livestock.
05重 7:15 The LORD will turn away from you every illness; all the dread diseases of Egypt that you experienced, he will not inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.
05重 7:16 You shall devour all the peoples that the LORD your God is giving over to you, showing them no pity; you shall not serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.
05重 7:17 If you say to yourself, "These nations are more numerous than I; how can I dispossess them?"
05重 7:18 do not be afraid of them. Just remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,
05重 7:19 the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
05重 7:20 Moreover, the LORD your God will send the pestilence against them, until even the survivors and the fugitives are destroyed.
05重 7:21 Have no dread of them, for the LORD your God, who is present with you, is a great and awesome God.
05重 7:22 The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to make a quick end of them, otherwise the wild animals would become too numerous for you.
05重 7:23 But the LORD your God will give them over to you, and throw them into great panic, until they are destroyed.
05重 7:24 He will hand their kings over to you and you shall blot out their name from under heaven; no one will be able to stand against you, until you have destroyed them.
05重 7:25 The images of their gods you shall burn with fire. Do not covet the silver or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself, because you could be ensnared by it; for it is abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05重 7:26 Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You must utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.
05重 8:1 This entire commandment that I command you today you must diligently observe, so that you may live and increase, and go in and occupy the land that the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors.
05重 8:2 Remember the long way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, in order to humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commandments.
05重 8:3 He humbled you by letting you hunger, then by feeding you with manna, with which neither you nor your ancestors were acquainted, in order to make you understand that one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
05重 8:4 The clothes on your back did not wear out and your feet did not swell these forty years.
05重 8:5 Know then in your heart that as a parent disciplines a child so the LORD your God disciplines you.
05重 8:6 Therefore keep the commandments of the LORD your God, by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
05重 8:7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with flowing streams, with springs and underground waters welling up in valleys and hills,
05重 8:8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,
05重 8:9 a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper.
05重 8:10 You shall eat your fill and bless the LORD your God for the good land that he has given you.
05重 8:11 Take care that you do not forget the LORD your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today.
05重 8:12 When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them,
05重 8:13 and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied,
05重 8:14 then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
05重 8:15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock,
05重 8:16 and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good.
05重 8:17 Do not say to yourself, "My power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth."
05重 8:18 But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today.
05重 8:19 If you do forget the LORD your God and follow other gods to serve and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.
05重 8:20 Like the nations that the LORD is destroying before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
05重 9:1 Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan today, to go in and dispossess nations larger and mightier than you, great cities, fortified to the heavens,
05重 9:2 a strong and tall people, the offspring of the Anakim, whom you know. You have heard it said of them, "Who can stand up to the Anakim?"
05重 9:3 Know then today that the LORD your God is the one who crosses over before you as a devouring fire; he will defeat them and subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
05重 9:4 When the LORD your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself, "It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to occupy this land"; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is dispossessing them before you.
05重 9:5 It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is dispossessing them before you, in order to fulfill the promise that the LORD made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
05重 9:6 Know, then, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to occupy because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.
05重 9:7 Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the LORD from the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place.
05重 9:8 Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
05重 9:9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
05重 9:10 And the LORD gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God; on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken to you at the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.
05重 9:11 At the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
05重 9:12 Then the LORD said to me, "Get up, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for themselves."
05重 9:13 Furthermore the LORD said to me, "I have seen that this people is indeed a stubborn people.
05重 9:14 Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and more numerous than they."
05重 9:15 So I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was ablaze; the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
05重 9:16 Then I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God, by casting for yourselves an image of a calf; you had been quick to turn from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
05重 9:17 So I took hold of the two tablets and flung them from my two hands, smashing them before your eyes.
05重 9:18 Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed, provoking the LORD by doing what was evil in his sight.
05重 9:19 For I was afraid that the anger that the LORD bore against you was so fierce that he would destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.
05重 9:20 The LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him, but I interceded also on behalf of Aaron at that same time.
05重 9:21 Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly, until it was reduced to dust; and I threw the dust of it into the stream that runs down the mountain.
05重 9:22 At Taberah also, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.
05重 9:23 And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, "Go up and occupy the land that I have given you," you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him.
05重 9:24 You have been rebellious against the LORD as long as he has known you.
05重 9:25 Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before the LORD when the LORD intended to destroy you,
05重 9:26 I prayed to the LORD and said, "Lord GOD, do not destroy the people who are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05重 9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin,
05重 9:28 otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, 'Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.'
05重 9:29 For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm."
05重 10:1 At that time the LORD said to me, "Carve out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
05重 10:2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you shall put them in the ark."
05重 10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
05重 10:4 Then he wrote on the tablets the same words as before, the ten commandments that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me.
05重 10:5 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark that I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.
05重 10:6 (The Israelites journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; his son Eleazar succeeded him as priest.
05重 10:7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with flowing streams.
05重 10:8 At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
05重 10:9 Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance with his kindred; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God promised him.)
05重 10:10 I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. And once again the LORD listened to me. The LORD was unwilling to destroy you.
05重 10:11 The LORD said to me, "Get up, go on your journey at the head of the people, that they may go in and occupy the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them."
05重 10:12 So now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you? Only to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
05重 10:13 and to keep the commandments of the LORD your God and his decrees that I am commanding you today, for your own well-being.
05重 10:14 Although heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the LORD your God, the earth with all that is in it,
05重 10:15 yet the LORD set his heart in love on your ancestors alone and chose you, their descendants after them, out of all the peoples, as it is today.
05重 10:16 Circumcise, then, the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn any longer.
05重 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who is not partial and takes no bribe,
05重 10:18 who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and who loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.
05重 10:19 You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
05重 10:20 You shall fear the LORD your God; him alone you shall worship; to him you shall hold fast, and by his name you shall swear.
05重 10:21 He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen.
05重 10:22 Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in heaven.
05重 11:1 You shall love the LORD your God, therefore, and keep his charge, his decrees, his ordinances, and his commandments always.
05重 11:2 Remember today that it was not your children (who have not known or seen the discipline of the LORD your God), but it is you who must acknowledge his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,
05重 11:3 his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
05重 11:4 what he did to the Egyptian army, to their horses and chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, so that the LORD has destroyed them to this day;
05重 11:5 what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
05重 11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab son of Reuben, how in the midst of all Israel the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households, their tents, and every living being in their company;
05重 11:7 for it is your own eyes that have seen every great deed that the LORD did.
05重 11:8 Keep, then, this entire commandment that I am commanding you today, so that you may have strength to go in and occupy the land that you are crossing over to occupy,
05重 11:9 and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your ancestors to give them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05重 11:10 For the land that you are about to enter to occupy is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sow your seed and irrigate by foot like a vegetable garden.
05重 11:11 But the land that you are crossing over to occupy is a land of hills and valleys, watered by rain from the sky,
05重 11:12 a land that the LORD your God looks after. The eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
05重 11:13 If you will only heed his every commandment that I am commanding you today--loving the LORD your God, and serving him with all your heart and with all your soul--
05重 11:14 then he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, and you will gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil;
05重 11:15 and he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat your fill.
05重 11:16 Take care, or you will be seduced into turning away, serving other gods and worshiping them,
05重 11:17 for then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain and the land will yield no fruit; then you will perish quickly off the good land that the LORD is giving you.
05重 11:18 You shall put these words of mine in your heart and soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and fix them as an emblem on your forehead.
05重 11:19 Teach them to your children, talking about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.
05重 11:20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
05重 11:21 so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.
05重 11:22 If you will diligently observe this entire commandment that I am commanding you, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,
05重 11:23 then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and mightier than yourselves.
05重 11:24 Every place on which you set foot shall be yours; your territory shall extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the Western Sea.
05重 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put the fear and dread of you on all the land on which you set foot, as he promised you.
05重 11:26 See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
05重 11:27 the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am commanding you today;
05重 11:28 and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn from the way that I am commanding you today, to follow other gods that you have not known.
05重 11:29 When the LORD your God has brought you into the land that you are entering to occupy, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
05重 11:30 As you know, they are beyond the Jordan, some distance to the west, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oak of Moreh.
05重 11:31 When you cross the Jordan to go in to occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and when you occupy it and live in it,
05重 11:32 you must diligently observe all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today.
05重 12:1 These are the statutes and ordinances that you must diligently observe in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you to occupy all the days that you live on the earth.
05重 12:2 You must demolish completely all the places where the nations whom you are about to dispossess served their gods, on the mountain heights, on the hills, and under every leafy tree.
05重 12:3 Break down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their sacred poles with fire, and hew down the idols of their gods, and thus blot out their name from their places.
05重 12:4 You shall not worship the LORD your God in such ways.
05重 12:5 But you shall seek the place that the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes as his habitation to put his name there. You shall go there,
05重 12:6 bringing there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, your votive gifts, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks.
05重 12:7 And you shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your households together, rejoicing in all the undertakings in which the LORD your God has blessed you.
05重 12:8 You shall not act as we are acting here today, all of us according to our own desires,
05重 12:9 for you have not yet come into the rest and the possession that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 12:10 When you cross over the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is allotting to you, and when he gives you rest from your enemies all around so that you live in safety,
05重 12:11 then you shall bring everything that I command you to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all your choice votive gifts that you vow to the LORD.
05重 12:12 And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you together with your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levites who reside in your towns (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you).
05重 12:13 Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place you happen to see.
05重 12:14 But only at the place that the LORD will choose in one of your tribes--there you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do everything I command you.
05重 12:15 Yet whenever you desire you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, according to the blessing that the LORD your God has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as they would of gazelle or deer.
05重 12:16 The blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 12:17 Nor may you eat within your towns the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, the firstlings of your herds and your flocks, any of your votive gifts that you vow, your freewill offerings, or your donations;
05重 12:18 these you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God at the place that the LORD your God will choose, you together with your son and your daughter, your male and female slaves, and the Levites resident in your towns, rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God in all your undertakings.
05重 12:19 Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.
05重 12:20 When the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, "I am going to eat some meat," because you wish to eat meat, you may eat meat whenever you have the desire.
05重 12:21 If the place where the LORD your God will choose to put his name is too far from you, and you slaughter as I have commanded you any of your herd or flock that the LORD has given you, then you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.
05重 12:22 Indeed, just as gazelle or deer is eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it.
05重 12:23 Only be sure that you do not eat the blood; for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the meat.
05重 12:24 Do not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 12:25 Do not eat it, so that all may go well with you and your children after you, because you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.
05重 12:26 But the sacred donations that are due from you, and your votive gifts, you shall bring to the place that the LORD will choose.
05重 12:27 You shall present your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; the blood of your other sacrifices shall be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God, but the meat you may eat.
05重 12:28 Be careful to obey all these words that I command you today, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05重 12:29 When the LORD your God has cut off before you the nations whom you are about to enter to dispossess them, when you have dispossessed them and live in their land,
05重 12:30 take care that you are not snared into imitating them, after they have been destroyed before you: do not inquire concerning their gods, saying, "How did these nations worship their gods? I also want to do the same."
05重 12:31 You must not do the same for the LORD your God, because every abhorrent thing that the LORD hates they have done for their gods. They would even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.
05重 12:32 You must diligently observe everything that I command you; do not add to it or take anything from it.
05重 13:1 If prophets or those who divine by dreams appear among you and promise you omens or portents,
05重 13:2 and the omens or the portents declared by them take place, and they say, "Let us follow other gods" (whom you have not known) "and let us serve them,"
05重 13:3 you must not heed the words of those prophets or those who divine by dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you indeed love the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
05重 13:4 The LORD your God you shall follow, him alone you shall fear, his commandments you shall keep, his voice you shall obey, him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast.
05重 13:5 But those prophets or those who divine by dreams shall be put to death for having spoken treason against the LORD your God--who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery--to turn you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 13:6 If anyone secretly entices you--even if it is your brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your most intimate friend--saying, "Let us go worship other gods," whom neither you nor your ancestors have known,
05重 13:7 any of the gods of the peoples that are around you, whether near you or far away from you, from one end of the earth to the other,
05重 13:8 you must not yield to or heed any such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do not shield them.
05重 13:9 But you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them to execute them, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
05重 13:10 Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 13:11 Then all Israel shall hear and be afraid, and never again do any such wickedness.
05重 13:12 If you hear it said about one of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you to live in,
05重 13:13 that scoundrels from among you have gone out and led the inhabitants of the town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods," whom you have not known,
05重 13:14 then you shall inquire and make a thorough investigation. If the charge is established that such an abhorrent thing has been done among you,
05重 13:15 you shall put the inhabitants of that town to the sword, utterly destroying it and everything in it--even putting its livestock to the sword.
05重 13:16 All of its spoil you shall gather into its public square; then burn the town and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall remain a perpetual ruin, never to be rebuilt.
05重 13:17 Do not let anything devoted to destruction stick to your hand, so that the LORD may turn from his fierce anger and show you compassion, and in his compassion multiply you, as he swore to your ancestors,
05重 13:18 if you obey the voice of the LORD your God by keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05重 14:1 You are children of the LORD your God. You must not lacerate yourselves or shave your forelocks for the dead.
05重 14:2 For you are a people holy to the LORD your God; it is you the LORD has chosen out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.
05重 14:3 You shall not eat any abhorrent thing.
05重 14:4 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05重 14:5 the hart, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain-sheep.
05重 14:6 Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof cleft in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.
05重 14:7 Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cleft you shall not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you.
05重 14:8 And the pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean for you. You shall not eat their meat, and you shall not touch their carcasses.
05重 14:9 Of all that live in water you may eat these: whatever has fins and scales you may eat.
05重 14:10 And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
05重 14:11 You may eat any clean birds.
05重 14:12 But these are the ones that you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
05重 14:13 the buzzard, the kite, of any kind;
05重 14:14 every raven of any kind;
05重 14:15 the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk, of any kind;
05重 14:16 the little owl and the great owl, the water hen
05重 14:17 and the desert owl, the carrion vulture and the cormorant,
05重 14:18 the stork, the heron, of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat.
05重 14:19 And all winged insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.
05重 14:20 You may eat any clean winged creature.
05重 14:21 You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to aliens residing in your towns for them to eat, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
05重 14:22 Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly from the field.
05重 14:23 In the presence of the LORD your God, in the place that he will choose as a dwelling for his name, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the firstlings of your herd and flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.
05重 14:24 But if, when the LORD your God has blessed you, the distance is so great that you are unable to transport it, because the place where the LORD your God will choose to set his name is too far away from you,
05重 14:25 then you may turn it into money. With the money secure in hand, go to the place that the LORD your God will choose;
05重 14:26 spend the money for whatever you wish--oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink, or whatever you desire. And you shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your household rejoicing together.
05重 14:27 As for the Levites resident in your towns, do not neglect them, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you.
05重 14:28 Every third year you shall bring out the full tithe of your produce for that year, and store it within your towns;
05重 14:29 the Levites, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you, as well as the resident aliens, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, may come and eat their fill so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work that you undertake.
05重 15:1 Every seventh year you shall grant a remission of debts.
05重 15:2 And this is the manner of the remission: every creditor shall remit the claim that is held against a neighbor, not exacting it of a neighbor who is a member of the community, because the LORD's remission has been proclaimed.
05重 15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it, but you must remit your claim on whatever any member of your community owes you.
05重 15:4 There will, however, be no one in need among you, because the LORD is sure to bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as a possession to occupy,
05重 15:5 if only you will obey the LORD your God by diligently observing this entire commandment that I command you today.
05重 15:6 When the LORD your God has blessed you, as he promised you, you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
05重 15:7 If there is among you anyone in need, a member of your community in any of your towns within the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your needy neighbor.
05重 15:8 You should rather open your hand, willingly lending enough to meet the need, whatever it may be.
05重 15:9 Be careful that you do not entertain a mean thought, thinking, "The seventh year, the year of remission, is near," and therefore view your needy neighbor with hostility and give nothing; your neighbor might cry to the LORD against you, and you would incur guilt.
05重 15:10 Give liberally and be ungrudging when you do so, for on this account the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake.
05重 15:11 Since there will never cease to be some in need on the earth, I therefore command you, "Open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land."
05重 15:12 If a member of your community, whether a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and works for you six years, in the seventh year you shall set that person free.
05重 15:13 And when you send a male slave out from you a free person, you shall not send him out empty-handed.
05重 15:14 Provide liberally out of your flock, your threshing floor, and your wine press, thus giving to him some of the bounty with which the LORD your God has blessed you.
05重 15:15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; for this reason I lay this command upon you today.
05重 15:16 But if he says to you, "I will not go out from you," because he loves you and your household, since he is well off with you,
05重 15:17 then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his earlobe into the door, and he shall be your slave forever. You shall do the same with regard to your female slave.
05重 15:18 Do not consider it a hardship when you send them out from you free persons, because for six years they have given you services worth the wages of hired laborers; and the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.
05重 15:19 Every firstling male born of your herd and flock you shall consecrate to the LORD your God; you shall not do work with your firstling ox nor shear the firstling of your flock.
05重 15:20 You shall eat it, you together with your household, in the presence of the LORD your God year by year at the place that the LORD will choose.
05重 15:21 But if it has any defect--any serious defect, such as lameness or blindness--you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God;
05重 15:22 within your towns you may eat it, the unclean and the clean alike, as you would a gazelle or deer.
05重 15:23 Its blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 16:1 Observe the month of Abib by keeping the passover for the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
05重 16:2 You shall offer the passover sacrifice for the LORD your God, from the flock and the herd, at the place that the LORD will choose as a dwelling for his name.
05重 16:3 You must not eat with it anything leavened. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it--the bread of affliction--because you came out of the land of Egypt in great haste, so that all the days of your life you may remember the day of your departure from the land of Egypt.
05重 16:4 No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days; and none of the meat of what you slaughter on the evening of the first day shall remain until morning.
05重 16:5 You are not permitted to offer the passover sacrifice within any of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 16:6 But at the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name, only there shall you offer the passover sacrifice, in the evening at sunset, the time of day when you departed from Egypt.
05重 16:7 You shall cook it and eat it at the place that the LORD your God will choose; the next morning you may go back to your tents.
05重 16:8 For six days you shall continue to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly for the LORD your God, when you shall do no work.
05重 16:9 You shall count seven weeks; begin to count the seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain.
05重 16:10 Then you shall keep the festival of weeks for the LORD your God, contributing a freewill offering in proportion to the blessing that you have received from the LORD your God.
05重 16:11 Rejoice before the LORD your God--you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, the Levites resident in your towns, as well as the strangers, the orphans, and the widows who are among you--at the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name.
05重 16:12 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and diligently observe these statutes.
05重 16:13 You shall keep the festival of booths for seven days, when you have gathered in the produce from your threshing floor and your wine press.
05重 16:14 Rejoice during your festival, you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, as well as the Levites, the strangers, the orphans, and the widows resident in your towns.
05重 16:15 Seven days you shall keep the festival for the LORD your God at the place that the LORD will choose; for the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all your undertakings, and you shall surely celebrate.
05重 16:16 Three times a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose: at the festival of unleavened bread, at the festival of weeks, and at the festival of booths. They shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed;
05重 16:17 all shall give as they are able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you.
05重 16:18 You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people.
05重 16:19 You must not distort justice; you must not show partiality; and you must not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of those who are in the right.
05重 16:20 Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, so that you may live and occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 16:21 You shall not plant any tree as a sacred pole beside the altar that you make for the LORD your God;
05重 16:22 nor shall you set up a stone pillar--things that the LORD your God hates.
05重 17:1 You must not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep that has a defect, anything seriously wrong; for that is abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05重 17:2 If there is found among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, and transgresses his covenant
05重 17:3 by going to serve other gods and worshiping them--whether the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden--
05重 17:4 and if it is reported to you or you hear of it, and you make a thorough inquiry, and the charge is proved true that such an abhorrent thing has occurred in Israel,
05重 17:5 then you shall bring out to your gates that man or that woman who has committed this crime and you shall stone the man or woman to death.
05重 17:6 On the evidence of two or three witnesses the death sentence shall be executed; a person must not be put to death on the evidence of only one witness.
05重 17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be the first raised against the person to execute the death penalty, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 17:8 If a judicial decision is too difficult for you to make between one kind of bloodshed and another, one kind of legal right and another, or one kind of assault and another--any such matters of dispute in your towns--then you shall immediately go up to the place that the LORD your God will choose,
05重 17:9 where you shall consult with the levitical priests and the judge who is in office in those days; they shall announce to you the decision in the case.
05重 17:10 Carry out exactly the decision that they announce to you from the place that the LORD will choose, diligently observing everything they instruct you.
05重 17:11 You must carry out fully the law that they interpret for you or the ruling that they announce to you; do not turn aside from the decision that they announce to you, either to the right or to the left.
05重 17:12 As for anyone who presumes to disobey the priest appointed to minister there to the LORD your God, or the judge, that person shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
05重 17:13 All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again.
05重 17:14 When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, "I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,"
05重 17:15 you may indeed set over you a king whom the LORD your God will choose. One of your own community you may set as king over you; you are not permitted to put a foreigner over you, who is not of your own community.
05重 17:16 Even so, he must not acquire many horses for himself, or return the people to Egypt in order to acquire more horses, since the LORD has said to you, "You must never return that way again."
05重 17:17 And he must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; also silver and gold he must not acquire in great quantity for himself.
05重 17:18 When he has taken the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law written for him in the presence of the levitical priests.
05重 17:19 It shall remain with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, diligently observing all the words of this law and these statutes,
05重 17:20 neither exalting himself above other members of the community nor turning aside from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he and his descendants may reign long over his kingdom in Israel.
05重 18:1 The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no allotment or inheritance within Israel. They may eat the sacrifices that are the LORD's portion
05重 18:2 but they shall have no inheritance among the other members of the community; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.
05重 18:3 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two jowls, and the stomach.
05重 18:4 The first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
05重 18:5 For the LORD your God has chosen Levi out of all your tribes, to stand and minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for all time.
05重 18:6 If a Levite leaves any of your towns, from wherever he has been residing in Israel, and comes to the place that the LORD will choose (and he may come whenever he wishes),
05重 18:7 then he may minister in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow-Levites who stand to minister there before the LORD.
05重 18:8 They shall have equal portions to eat, even though they have income from the sale of family possessions.
05重 18:9 When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations.
05重 18:10 No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer,
05重 18:11 or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead.
05重 18:12 For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the LORD; it is because of such abhorrent practices that the LORD your God is driving them out before you.
05重 18:13 You must remain completely loyal to the LORD your God.
05重 18:14 Although these nations that you are about to dispossess do give heed to soothsayers and diviners, as for you, the LORD your God does not permit you to do so.
05重 18:15 The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet.
05重 18:16 This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: "If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die."
05重 18:17 Then the LORD replied to me: "They are right in what they have said.
05重 18:18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command.
05重 18:19 Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable.
05重 18:20 But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak--that prophet shall die."
05重 18:21 You may say to yourself, "How can we recognize a word that the LORD has not spoken?"
05重 18:22 If a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD but the thing does not take place or prove true, it is a word that the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; do not be frightened by it.
05重 19:1 When the LORD your God has cut off the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you, and you have dispossessed them and settled in their towns and in their houses,
05重 19:2 you shall set apart three cities in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05重 19:3 You shall calculate the distances and divide into three regions the land that the LORD your God gives you as a possession, so that any homicide can flee to one of them.
05重 19:4 Now this is the case of a homicide who might flee there and live, that is, someone who has killed another person unintentionally when the two had not been at enmity before:
05重 19:5 Suppose someone goes into the forest with another to cut wood, and when one of them swings the ax to cut down a tree, the head slips from the handle and strikes the other person who then dies; the killer may flee to one of these cities and live.
05重 19:6 But if the distance is too great, the avenger of blood in hot anger might pursue and overtake and put the killer to death, although a death sentence was not deserved, since the two had not been at enmity before.
05重 19:7 Therefore I command you: You shall set apart three cities.
05重 19:8 If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors--and he will give you all the land that he promised your ancestors to give you,
05重 19:9 provided you diligently observe this entire commandment that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and walking always in his ways--then you shall add three more cities to these three,
05重 19:10 so that the blood of an innocent person may not be shed in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, thereby bringing bloodguilt upon you.
05重 19:11 But if someone at enmity with another lies in wait and attacks and takes the life of that person, and flees into one of these cities,
05重 19:12 then the elders of the killer's city shall send to have the culprit taken from there and handed over to the avenger of blood to be put to death.
05重 19:13 Show no pity; you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you.
05重 19:14 You must not move your neighbor's boundary marker, set up by former generations, on the property that will be allotted to you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05重 19:15 A single witness shall not suffice to convict a person of any crime or wrongdoing in connection with any offense that may be committed. Only on the evidence of two or three witnesses shall a charge be sustained.
05重 19:16 If a malicious witness comes forward to accuse someone of wrongdoing,
05重 19:17 then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days,
05重 19:18 and the judges shall make a thorough inquiry. If the witness is a false witness, having testified falsely against another,
05重 19:19 then you shall do to the false witness just as the false witness had meant to do to the other. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 19:20 The rest shall hear and be afraid, and a crime such as this shall never again be committed among you.
05重 19:21 Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
05重 20:1 When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots, an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
05重 20:2 Before you engage in battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the troops,
05重 20:3 and shall say to them: "Hear, O Israel! Today you are drawing near to do battle against your enemies. Do not lose heart, or be afraid, or panic, or be in dread of them;
05重 20:4 for it is the LORD your God who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to give you victory."
05重 20:5 Then the officials shall address the troops, saying, "Has anyone built a new house but not dedicated it? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another dedicate it.
05重 20:6 Has anyone planted a vineyard but not yet enjoyed its fruit? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another be first to enjoy its fruit.
05重 20:7 Has anyone become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another marry her."
05重 20:8 The officials shall continue to address the troops, saying, "Is anyone afraid or disheartened? He should go back to his house, or he might cause the heart of his comrades to melt like his own."
05重 20:9 When the officials have finished addressing the troops, then the commanders shall take charge of them.
05重 20:10 When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of peace.
05重 20:11 If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people in it shall serve you at forced labor.
05重 20:12 If it does not submit to you peacefully, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it;
05重 20:13 and when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword.
05重 20:14 You may, however, take as your booty the women, the children, livestock, and everything else in the town, all its spoil. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.
05重 20:15 Thus you shall treat all the towns that are very far from you, which are not towns of the nations here.
05重 20:16 But as for the towns of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not let anything that breathes remain alive.
05重 20:17 You shall annihilate them--the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites--just as the LORD your God has commanded,
05重 20:18 so that they may not teach you to do all the abhorrent things that they do for their gods, and you thus sin against the LORD your God.
05重 20:19 If you besiege a town for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them. Although you may take food from them, you must not cut them down. Are trees in the field human beings that they should come under siege from you?
05重 20:20 You may destroy only the trees that you know do not produce food; you may cut them down for use in building siegeworks against the town that makes war with you, until it falls.
05重 21:1 If, in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess, a body is found lying in open country, and it is not known who struck the person down,
05重 21:2 then your elders and your judges shall come out to measure the distances to the towns that are near the body.
05重 21:3 The elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked, one that has not pulled in the yoke;
05重 21:4 the elders of that town shall bring the heifer down to a wadi with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the wadi.
05重 21:5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to him and to pronounce blessings in the name of the LORD, and by their decision all cases of dispute and assault shall be settled.
05重 21:6 All the elders of that town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi,
05重 21:7 and they shall declare: "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor were we witnesses to it.
05重 21:8 Absolve, O LORD, your people Israel, whom you redeemed; do not let the guilt of innocent blood remain in the midst of your people Israel." Then they will be absolved of bloodguilt.
05重 21:9 So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, because you must do what is right in the sight of the LORD.
05重 21:10 When you go out to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God hands them over to you and you take them captive,
05重 21:11 suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman whom you desire and want to marry,
05重 21:12 and so you bring her home to your house: she shall shave her head, pare her nails,
05重 21:13 discard her captive's garb, and shall remain in your house a full month, mourning for her father and mother; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
05重 21:14 But if you are not satisfied with her, you shall let her go free and not sell her for money. You must not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
05重 21:15 If a man has two wives, one of them loved and the other disliked, and if both the loved and the disliked have borne him sons, the firstborn being the son of the one who is disliked,
05重 21:16 then on the day when he wills his possessions to his sons, he is not permitted to treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the disliked, who is the firstborn.
05重 21:17 He must acknowledge as firstborn the son of the one who is disliked, giving him a double portion of all that he has; since he is the first issue of his virility, the right of the firstborn is his.
05重 21:18 If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him,
05重 21:19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place.
05重 21:20 They shall say to the elders of his town, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard."
05重 21:21 Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid.
05重 21:22 When someone is convicted of a crime punishable by death and is executed, and you hang him on a tree,
05重 21:23 his corpse must not remain all night upon the tree; you shall bury him that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you for possession.
05重 22:1 You shall not watch your neighbor's ox or sheep straying away and ignore them; you shall take them back to their owner.
05重 22:2 If the owner does not reside near you or you do not know who the owner is, you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall remain with you until the owner claims it; then you shall return it.
05重 22:3 You shall do the same with a neighbor's donkey; you shall do the same with a neighbor's garment; and you shall do the same with anything else that your neighbor loses and you find. You may not withhold your help.
05重 22:4 You shall not see your neighbor's donkey or ox fallen on the road and ignore it; you shall help to lift it up.
05重 22:5 A woman shall not wear a man's apparel, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whoever does such things is abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05重 22:6 If you come on a bird's nest, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, with the mother sitting on the fledglings or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young.
05重 22:7 Let the mother go, taking only the young for yourself, in order that it may go well with you and you may live long.
05重 22:8 When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof; otherwise you might have bloodguilt on your house, if anyone should fall from it.
05重 22:9 You shall not sow your vineyard with a second kind of seed, or the whole yield will have to be forfeited, both the crop that you have sown and the yield of the vineyard itself.
05重 22:10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
05重 22:11 You shall not wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.
05重 22:12 You shall make tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.
05重 22:13 Suppose a man marries a woman, but after going in to her, he dislikes her
05重 22:14 and makes up charges against her, slandering her by saying, "I married this woman; but when I lay with her, I did not find evidence of her virginity."
05重 22:15 The father of the young woman and her mother shall then submit the evidence of the young woman's virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
05重 22:16 The father of the young woman shall say to the elders: "I gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he dislikes her;
05重 22:17 now he has made up charges against her, saying, 'I did not find evidence of your daughter's virginity.' But here is the evidence of my daughter's virginity." Then they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the town.
05重 22:18 The elders of that town shall take the man and punish him;
05重 22:19 they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver (which they shall give to the young woman's father) because he has slandered a virgin of Israel. She shall remain his wife; he shall not be permitted to divorce her as long as he lives.
05重 22:20 If, however, this charge is true, that evidence of the young woman's virginity was not found,
05重 22:21 then they shall bring the young woman out to the entrance of her father's house and the men of her town shall stone her to death, because she committed a disgraceful act in Israel by prostituting herself in her father's house. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 22:22 If a man is caught lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman as well as the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
05重 22:23 If there is a young woman, a virgin already engaged to be married, and a man meets her in the town and lies with her,
05重 22:24 you shall bring both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death, the young woman because she did not cry for help in the town and the man because he violated his neighbor's wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 22:25 But if the man meets the engaged woman in the open country, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.
05重 22:26 You shall do nothing to the young woman; the young woman has not committed an offense punishable by death, because this case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor.
05重 22:27 Since he found her in the open country, the engaged woman may have cried for help, but there was no one to rescue her.
05重 22:28 If a man meets a virgin who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are caught in the act,
05重 22:29 the man who lay with her shall give fifty shekels of silver to the young woman's father, and she shall become his wife. Because he violated her he shall not be permitted to divorce her as long as he lives.
05重 22:30 A man shall not marry his father's wife, thereby violating his father's rights.
05重 23:1 No one whose testicles are crushed or whose penis is cut off shall be admitted to the assembly of the LORD.
05重 23:2 Those born of an illicit union shall not be admitted to the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants shall be admitted to the assembly of the LORD.
05重 23:3 No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted to the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants shall be admitted to the assembly of the LORD,
05重 23:4 because they did not meet you with food and water on your journey out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam son of Beor, from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
05重 23:5 (Yet the LORD your God refused to heed Balaam; the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loved you.)
05重 23:6 You shall never promote their welfare or their prosperity as long as you live.
05重 23:7 You shall not abhor any of the Edomites, for they are your kin. You shall not abhor any of the Egyptians, because you were an alien residing in their land.
05重 23:8 The children of the third generation that are born to them may be admitted to the assembly of the LORD.
05重 23:9 When you are encamped against your enemies you shall guard against any impropriety.
05重 23:10 If one of you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, then he shall go outside the camp; he must not come within the camp.
05重 23:11 When evening comes, he shall wash himself with water, and when the sun has set, he may come back into the camp.
05重 23:12 You shall have a designated area outside the camp to which you shall go.
05重 23:13 With your utensils you shall have a trowel; when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig a hole with it and then cover up your excrement.
05重 23:14 Because the LORD your God travels along with your camp, to save you and to hand over your enemies to you, therefore your camp must be holy, so that he may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.
05重 23:15 Slaves who have escaped to you from their owners shall not be given back to them.
05重 23:16 They shall reside with you, in your midst, in any place they choose in any one of your towns, wherever they please; you shall not oppress them.
05重 23:17 None of the daughters of Israel shall be a temple prostitute; none of the sons of Israel shall be a temple prostitute.
05重 23:18 You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the wages of a male prostitute into the house of the LORD your God in payment for any vow, for both of these are abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05重 23:19 You shall not charge interest on loans to another Israelite, interest on money, interest on provisions, interest on anything that is lent.
05重 23:20 On loans to a foreigner you may charge interest, but on loans to another Israelite you may not charge interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all your undertakings in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
05重 23:21 If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not postpone fulfilling it; for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and you would incur guilt.
05重 23:22 But if you refrain from vowing, you will not incur guilt.
05重 23:23 Whatever your lips utter you must diligently perform, just as you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth.
05重 23:24 If you go into your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, as many as you wish, but you shall not put any in a container.
05重 23:25 If you go into your neighbor's standing grain, you may pluck the ears with your hand, but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
05重 24:1 Suppose a man enters into marriage with a woman, but she does not please him because he finds something objectionable about her, and so he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; she then leaves his house
05重 24:2 and goes off to become another man's wife.
05重 24:3 Then suppose the second man dislikes her, writes her a bill of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house (or the second man who married her dies);
05重 24:4 her first husband, who sent her away, is not permitted to take her again to be his wife after she has been defiled; for that would be abhorrent to the LORD, and you shall not bring guilt on the land that the LORD your God is giving you as a possession.
05重 24:5 When a man is newly married, he shall not go out with the army or be charged with any related duty. He shall be free at home one year, to be happy with the wife whom he has married.
05重 24:6 No one shall take a mill or an upper millstone in pledge, for that would be taking a life in pledge.
05重 24:7 If someone is caught kidnaping another Israelite, enslaving or selling the Israelite, then that kidnaper shall die. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 24:8 Guard against an outbreak of a leprous skin disease by being very careful; you shall carefully observe whatever the levitical priests instruct you, just as I have commanded them.
05重 24:9 Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on your journey out of Egypt.
05重 24:10 When you make your neighbor a loan of any kind, you shall not go into the house to take the pledge.
05重 24:11 You shall wait outside, while the person to whom you are making the loan brings the pledge out to you.
05重 24:12 If the person is poor, you shall not sleep in the garment given you as the pledge.
05重 24:13 You shall give the pledge back by sunset, so that your neighbor may sleep in the cloak and bless you; and it will be to your credit before the LORD your God.
05重 24:14 You shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other Israelites or aliens who reside in your land in one of your towns.
05重 24:15 You shall pay them their wages daily before sunset, because they are poor and their livelihood depends on them; otherwise they might cry to the LORD against you, and you would incur guilt.
05重 24:16 Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their parents; only for their own crimes may persons be put to death.
05重 24:17 You shall not deprive a resident alien or an orphan of justice; you shall not take a widow's garment in pledge.
05重 24:18 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I command you to do this.
05重 24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be left for the alien, the orphan, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all your undertakings.
05重 24:20 When you beat your olive trees, do not strip what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
05重 24:21 When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
05重 24:22 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this.
05重 25:1 Suppose two persons have a dispute and enter into litigation, and the judges decide between them, declaring one to be in the right and the other to be in the wrong.
05重 25:2 If the one in the wrong deserves to be flogged, the judge shall make that person lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes proportionate to the offense.
05重 25:3 Forty lashes may be given but not more; if more lashes than these are given, your neighbor will be degraded in your sight.
05重 25:4 You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
05重 25:5 When brothers reside together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the deceased shall not be married outside the family to a stranger. Her husband's brother shall go in to her, taking her in marriage, and performing the duty of a husband's brother to her,
05重 25:6 and the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed to the name of the deceased brother, so that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.
05重 25:7 But if the man has no desire to marry his brother's widow, then his brother's widow shall go up to the elders at the gate and say, "My husband's brother refuses to perpetuate his brother's name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me."
05重 25:8 Then the elders of his town shall summon him and speak to him. If he persists, saying, "I have no desire to marry her,"
05重 25:9 then his brother's wife shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, pull his sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and declare, "This is what is done to the man who does not build up his brother's house."
05重 25:10 Throughout Israel his family shall be known as "the house of him whose sandal was pulled off."
05重 25:11 If men get into a fight with one another, and the wife of one intervenes to rescue her husband from the grip of his opponent by reaching out and seizing his genitals,
05重 25:12 you shall cut off her hand; show no pity.
05重 25:13 You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights, large and small.
05重 25:14 You shall not have in your house two kinds of measures, large and small.
05重 25:15 You shall have only a full and honest weight; you shall have only a full and honest measure, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 25:16 For all who do such things, all who act dishonestly, are abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05重 25:17 Remember what Amalek did to you on your journey out of Egypt,
05重 25:18 how he attacked you on the way, when you were faint and weary, and struck down all who lagged behind you; he did not fear God.
05重 25:19 Therefore when the LORD your God has given you rest from all your enemies on every hand, in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; do not forget.
05重 26:1 When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it,
05重 26:2 you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name.
05重 26:3 You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, "Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us."
05重 26:4 When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God,
05重 26:5 you shall make this response before the LORD your God: "A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous.
05重 26:6 When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us,
05重 26:7 we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.
05重 26:8 The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders;
05重 26:9 and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05重 26:10 So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me." You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God.
05重 26:11 Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.
05重 26:12 When you have finished paying all the tithe of your produce in the third year (which is the year of the tithe), giving it to the Levites, the aliens, the orphans, and the widows, so that they may eat their fill within your towns,
05重 26:13 then you shall say before the LORD your God: "I have removed the sacred portion from the house, and I have given it to the Levites, the resident aliens, the orphans, and the widows, in accordance with your entire commandment that you commanded me; I have neither transgressed nor forgotten any of your commandments:
05重 26:14 I have not eaten of it while in mourning; I have not removed any of it while I was unclean; and I have not offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God, doing just as you commanded me.
05重 26:15 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel and the ground that you have given us, as you swore to our ancestors--a land flowing with milk and honey."
05重 26:16 This very day the LORD your God is commanding you to observe these statutes and ordinances; so observe them diligently with all your heart and with all your soul.
05重 26:17 Today you have obtained the LORD's agreement: to be your God; and for you to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, and his ordinances, and to obey him.
05重 26:18 Today the LORD has obtained your agreement: to be his treasured people, as he promised you, and to keep his commandments;
05重 26:19 for him to set you high above all nations that he has made, in praise and in fame and in honor; and for you to be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised.
05重 27:1 Then Moses and the elders of Israel charged all the people as follows: Keep the entire commandment that I am commanding you today.
05重 27:2 On the day that you cross over the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones and cover them with plaster.
05重 27:3 You shall write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over, to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
05重 27:4 So when you have crossed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, about which I am commanding you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall cover them with plaster.
05重 27:5 And you shall build an altar there to the LORD your God, an altar of stones on which you have not used an iron tool.
05重 27:6 You must build the altar of the LORD your God of unhewn stones. Then offer up burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God,
05重 27:7 make sacrifices of well-being, and eat them there, rejoicing before the LORD your God.
05重 27:8 You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very clearly.
05重 27:9 Then Moses and the levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: Keep silence and hear, O Israel! This very day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
05重 27:10 Therefore obey the LORD your God, observing his commandments and his statutes that I am commanding you today.
05重 27:11 The same day Moses charged the people as follows:
05重 27:12 When you have crossed over the Jordan, these shall stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessing of the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
05重 27:13 And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
05重 27:14 Then the Levites shall declare in a loud voice to all the Israelites:
05重 27:15 "Cursed be anyone who makes an idol or casts an image, anything abhorrent to the LORD, the work of an artisan, and sets it up in secret." All the people shall respond, saying, "Amen!"
05重 27:16 "Cursed be anyone who dishonors father or mother." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:17 "Cursed be anyone who moves a neighbor's boundary marker." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:18 "Cursed be anyone who misleads a blind person on the road." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:19 "Cursed be anyone who deprives the alien, the orphan, and the widow of justice." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:20 "Cursed be anyone who lies with his father's wife, because he has violated his father's rights." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:21 "Cursed be anyone who lies with any animal." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:22 "Cursed be anyone who lies with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:23 "Cursed be anyone who lies with his mother-in-law." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:24 "Cursed be anyone who strikes down a neighbor in secret." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:25 "Cursed be anyone who takes a bribe to shed innocent blood." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 27:26 "Cursed be anyone who does not uphold the words of this law by observing them." All the people shall say, "Amen!"
05重 28:1 If you will only obey the LORD your God, by diligently observing all his commandments that I am commanding you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth;
05重 28:2 all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the LORD your God:
05重 28:3 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.
05重 28:4 Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your livestock, both the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock.
05重 28:5 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
05重 28:6 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
05重 28:7 The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you; they shall come out against you one way, and flee before you seven ways.
05重 28:8 The LORD will command the blessing upon you in your barns, and in all that you undertake; he will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 28:9 The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in his ways.
05重 28:10 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they shall be afraid of you.
05重 28:11 The LORD will make you abound in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground in the land that the LORD swore to your ancestors to give you.
05重 28:12 The LORD will open for you his rich storehouse, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its season and to bless all your undertakings. You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow.
05重 28:13 The LORD will make you the head, and not the tail; you shall be only at the top, and not at the bottom--if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today, by diligently observing them,
05重 28:14 and if you do not turn aside from any of the words that I am commanding you today, either to the right or to the left, following other gods to serve them.
05重 28:15 But if you will not obey the LORD your God by diligently observing all his commandments and decrees, which I am commanding you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you:
05重 28:16 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
05重 28:17 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
05重 28:18 Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock.
05重 28:19 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
05重 28:20 The LORD will send upon you disaster, panic, and frustration in everything you attempt to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly, on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken me.
05重 28:21 The LORD will make the pestilence cling to you until it has consumed you off the land that you are entering to possess.
05重 28:22 The LORD will afflict you with consumption, fever, inflammation, with fiery heat and drought, and with blight and mildew; they shall pursue you until you perish.
05重 28:23 The sky over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you iron.
05重 28:24 The LORD will change the rain of your land into powder, and only dust shall come down upon you from the sky until you are destroyed.
05重 28:25 The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you shall go out against them one way and flee before them seven ways. You shall become an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
05重 28:26 Your corpses shall be food for every bird of the air and animal of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away.
05重 28:27 The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with ulcers, scurvy, and itch, of which you cannot be healed.
05重 28:28 The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind;
05重 28:29 you shall grope about at noon as blind people grope in darkness, but you shall be unable to find your way; and you shall be continually abused and robbed, without anyone to help.
05重 28:30 You shall become engaged to a woman, but another man shall lie with her. You shall build a house, but not live in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but not enjoy its fruit.
05重 28:31 Your ox shall be butchered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it. Your donkey shall be stolen in front of you, and shall not be restored to you. Your sheep shall be given to your enemies, without anyone to help you.
05重 28:32 Your sons and daughters shall be given to another people, while you look on; you will strain your eyes looking for them all day but be powerless to do anything.
05重 28:33 A people whom you do not know shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors; you shall be continually abused and crushed,
05重 28:34 and driven mad by the sight that your eyes shall see.
05重 28:35 The LORD will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
05重 28:36 The LORD will bring you, and the king whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your ancestors have known, where you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone.
05重 28:37 You shall become an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where the LORD will lead you.
05重 28:38 You shall carry much seed into the field but shall gather little in, for the locust shall consume it.
05重 28:39 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them.
05重 28:40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives shall drop off.
05重 28:41 You shall have sons and daughters, but they shall not remain yours, for they shall go into captivity.
05重 28:42 All your trees and the fruit of your ground the cicada shall take over.
05重 28:43 Aliens residing among you shall ascend above you higher and higher, while you shall descend lower and lower.
05重 28:44 They shall lend to you but you shall not lend to them; they shall be the head and you shall be the tail.
05重 28:45 All these curses shall come upon you, pursuing and overtaking you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God, by observing the commandments and the decrees that he commanded you.
05重 28:46 They shall be among you and your descendants as a sign and a portent forever.
05重 28:47 Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and with gladness of heart for the abundance of everything,
05重 28:48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and lack of everything. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
05重 28:49 The LORD will bring a nation from far away, from the end of the earth, to swoop down on you like an eagle, a nation whose language you do not understand,
05重 28:50 a grim-faced nation showing no respect to the old or favor to the young.
05重 28:51 It shall consume the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground until you are destroyed, leaving you neither grain, wine, and oil, nor the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock, until it has made you perish.
05重 28:52 It shall besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls, in which you trusted, come down throughout your land; it shall besiege you in all your towns throughout the land that the LORD your God has given you.
05重 28:53 In the desperate straits to which the enemy siege reduces you, you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your own sons and daughters whom the LORD your God has given you.
05重 28:54 Even the most refined and gentle of men among you will begrudge food to his own brother, to the wife whom he embraces, and to the last of his remaining children,
05重 28:55 giving to none of them any of the flesh of his children whom he is eating, because nothing else remains to him, in the desperate straits to which the enemy siege will reduce you in all your towns.
05重 28:56 She who is the most refined and gentle among you, so gentle and refined that she does not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge food to the husband whom she embraces, to her own son, and to her own daughter,
05重 28:57 begrudging even the afterbirth that comes out from between her thighs, and the children that she bears, because she is eating them in secret for lack of anything else, in the desperate straits to which the enemy siege will reduce you in your towns.
05重 28:58 If you do not diligently observe all the words of this law that are written in this book, fearing this glorious and awesome name, the LORD your God,
05重 28:59 then the LORD will overwhelm both you and your offspring with severe and lasting afflictions and grievous and lasting maladies.
05重 28:60 He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were in dread, and they shall cling to you.
05重 28:61 Every other malady and affliction, even though not recorded in the book of this law, the LORD will inflict on you until you are destroyed.
05重 28:62 Although once you were as numerous as the stars in heaven, you shall be left few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
05重 28:63 And just as the LORD took delight in making you prosperous and numerous, so the LORD will take delight in bringing you to ruin and destruction; you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to possess.
05重 28:64 The LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known.
05重 28:65 Among those nations you shall find no ease, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a languishing spirit.
05重 28:66 Your life shall hang in doubt before you; night and day you shall be in dread, with no assurance of your life.
05重 28:67 In the morning you shall say, "If only it were evening!" and at evening you shall say, "If only it were morning!"--because of the dread that your heart shall feel and the sights that your eyes shall see.
05重 28:68 The LORD will bring you back in ships to Egypt, by a route that I promised you would never see again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.
05重 29:1 These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant that he had made with them at Horeb.
05重 29:2 Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
05重 29:3 the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.
05重 29:4 But to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear.
05重 29:5 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. The clothes on your back have not worn out, and the sandals on your feet have not worn out;
05重 29:6 you have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink--so that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
05重 29:7 When you came to this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out against us for battle, but we defeated them.
05重 29:8 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
05重 29:9 Therefore diligently observe the words of this covenant, in order that you may succeed in everything that you do.
05重 29:10 You stand assembled today, all of you, before the LORD your God--the leaders of your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel,
05重 29:11 your children, your women, and the aliens who are in your camp, both those who cut your wood and those who draw your water--
05重 29:12 to enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, sworn by an oath, which the LORD your God is making with you today;
05重 29:13 in order that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
05重 29:14 I am making this covenant, sworn by an oath, not only with you who stand here with us today before the LORD our God,
05重 29:15 but also with those who are not here with us today.
05重 29:16 You know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed.
05重 29:17 You have seen their detestable things, the filthy idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold, that were among them.
05重 29:18 It may be that there is among you a man or woman, or a family or tribe, whose heart is already turning away from the LORD our God to serve the gods of those nations. It may be that there is among you a root sprouting poisonous and bitter growth.
05重 29:19 All who hear the words of this oath and bless themselves, thinking in their hearts, "We are safe even though we go our own stubborn ways" (thus bringing disaster on moist and dry alike)--
05重 29:20 the LORD will be unwilling to pardon them, for the LORD's anger and passion will smoke against them. All the curses written in this book will descend on them, and the LORD will blot out their names from under heaven.
05重 29:21 The LORD will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.
05重 29:22 The next generation, your children who rise up after you, as well as the foreigner who comes from a distant country, will see the devastation of that land and the afflictions with which the LORD has afflicted it--
05重 29:23 all its soil burned out by sulfur and salt, nothing planted, nothing sprouting, unable to support any vegetation, like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed in his fierce anger--
05重 29:24 they and indeed all the nations will wonder, "Why has the LORD done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger?"
05重 29:25 They will conclude, "It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
05重 29:26 They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them;
05重 29:27 so the anger of the LORD was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book.
05重 29:28 The LORD uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case."
05重 29:29 The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the revealed things belong to us and to our children forever, to observe all the words of this law.
05重 30:1 When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you,
05重 30:2 and return to the LORD your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today,
05重 30:3 then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the LORD your God has scattered you.
05重 30:4 Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back.
05重 30:5 The LORD your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.
05重 30:6 Moreover, the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may live.
05重 30:7 The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on the adversaries who took advantage of you.
05重 30:8 Then you shall again obey the LORD, observing all his commandments that I am commanding you today,
05重 30:9 and the LORD your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all your undertakings, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your soil. For the LORD will again take delight in prospering you, just as he delighted in prospering your ancestors,
05重 30:10 when you obey the LORD your God by observing his commandments and decrees that are written in this book of the law, because you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05重 30:11 Surely, this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away.
05重 30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?"
05重 30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?"
05重 30:14 No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe.
05重 30:15 See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity.
05重 30:16 If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am commanding you today, by loving the LORD your God, walking in his ways, and observing his commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
05重 30:17 But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to bow down to other gods and serve them,
05重 30:18 I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
05重 30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live,
05重 30:20 loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the LORD swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
05重 31:1 When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
05重 31:2 he said to them: "I am now one hundred twenty years old. I am no longer able to get about, and the LORD has told me, 'You shall not cross over this Jordan.'
05重 31:3 The LORD your God himself will cross over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua also will cross over before you, as the LORD promised.
05重 31:4 The LORD will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them.
05重 31:5 The LORD will give them over to you and you shall deal with them in full accord with the command that I have given to you.
05重 31:6 Be strong and bold; have no fear or dread of them, because it is the LORD your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you."
05重 31:7 Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: "Be strong and bold, for you are the one who will go with this people into the land that the LORD has sworn to their ancestors to give them; and you will put them in possession of it.
05重 31:8 It is the LORD who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed."
05重 31:9 Then Moses wrote down this law, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
05重 31:10 Moses commanded them: "Every seventh year, in the scheduled year of remission, during the festival of booths,
05重 31:11 when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
05重 31:12 Assemble the people--men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns--so that they may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God and to observe diligently all the words of this law,
05重 31:13 and so that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess."
05重 31:14 The LORD said to Moses, "Your time to die is near; call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting,
05重 31:15 and the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud; the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance to the tent.
05重 31:16 The LORD said to Moses, "Soon you will lie down with your ancestors. Then this people will begin to prostitute themselves to the foreign gods in their midst, the gods of the land into which they are going; they will forsake me, breaking my covenant that I have made with them.
05重 31:17 My anger will be kindled against them in that day. I will forsake them and hide my face from them; they will become easy prey, and many terrible troubles will come upon them. In that day they will say, 'Have not these troubles come upon us because our God is not in our midst?'
05重 31:18 On that day I will surely hide my face on account of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
05重 31:19 Now therefore write this song, and teach it to the Israelites; put it in their mouths, in order that this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites.
05重 31:20 For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant.
05重 31:21 And when many terrible troubles come upon them, this song will confront them as a witness, because it will not be lost from the mouths of their descendants. For I know what they are inclined to do even now, before I have brought them into the land that I promised them on oath."
05重 31:22 That very day Moses wrote this song and taught it to the Israelites.
05重 31:23 Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, "Be strong and bold, for you shall bring the Israelites into the land that I promised them; I will be with you."
05重 31:24 When Moses had finished writing down in a book the words of this law to the very end,
05重 31:25 Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
05重 31:26 "Take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God; let it remain there as a witness against you.
05重 31:27 For I know well how rebellious and stubborn you are. If you already have been so rebellious toward the LORD while I am still alive among you, how much more after my death!
05重 31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may recite these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
05重 31:29 For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly, turning aside from the way that I have commanded you. In time to come trouble will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands."
05重 31:30 Then Moses recited the words of this song, to the very end, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
05重 32:1 Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
05重 32:2 May my teaching drop like the rain, my speech condense like the dew; like gentle rain on grass, like showers on new growth.
05重 32:3 For I will proclaim the name of the LORD; ascribe greatness to our God!
05重 32:4 The Rock, his work is perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God, without deceit, just and upright is he;
05重 32:5 yet his degenerate children have dealt falsely with him, a perverse and crooked generation.
05重 32:6 Do you thus repay the LORD, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?
05重 32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years long past; ask your father, and he will inform you; your elders, and they will tell you.
05重 32:8 When the Most High apportioned the nations, when he divided humankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the gods;
05重 32:9 the LORD's own portion was his people, Jacob his allotted share.
05重 32:10 He sustained him in a desert land, in a howling wilderness waste; he shielded him, cared for him, guarded him as the apple of his eye.
05重 32:11 As an eagle stirs up its nest, and hovers over its young; as it spreads its wings, takes them up, and bears them aloft on its pinions,
05重 32:12 the LORD alone guided him; no foreign god was with him.
05重 32:13 He set him atop the heights of the land, and fed him with produce of the field; he nursed him with honey from the crags, with oil from flinty rock;
05重 32:14 curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs and rams; Bashan bulls and goats, together with the choicest wheat--you drank fine wine from the blood of grapes.
05重 32:15 Jacob ate his fill; Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You grew fat, bloated, and gorged! He abandoned God who made him, and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.
05重 32:16 They made him jealous with strange gods, with abhorrent things they provoked him.
05重 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not God, to deities they had never known, to new ones recently arrived, whom your ancestors had not feared.
05重 32:18 You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.
05重 32:19 The LORD saw it, and was jealous he spurned his sons and daughters.
05重 32:20 He said: I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children in whom there is no faithfulness.
05重 32:21 They made me jealous with what is no god, provoked me with their idols. So I will make them jealous with what is no people, provoke them with a foolish nation.
05重 32:22 For a fire is kindled by my anger, and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
05重 32:23 I will heap disasters upon them, spend my arrows against them:
05重 32:24 wasting hunger, burning consumption, bitter pestilence. The teeth of beasts I will send against them, with venom of things crawling in the dust.
05重 32:25 In the street the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers terror, for young man and woman alike, nursing child and old gray head.
05重 32:26 I thought to scatter them and blot out the memory of them from humankind;
05重 32:27 but I feared provocation by the enemy, for their adversaries might misunderstand and say, "Our hand is triumphant; it was not the LORD who did all this."
05重 32:28 They are a nation void of sense; there is no understanding in them.
05重 32:29 If they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern what the end would be.
05重 32:30 How could one have routed a thousand, and two put a myriad to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, the LORD had given them up?
05重 32:31 Indeed their rock is not like our Rock; our enemies are fools.
05重 32:32 Their vine comes from the vinestock of Sodom, from the vineyards of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;
05重 32:33 their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.
05重 32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?
05重 32:35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; because the day of their calamity is at hand, their doom comes swiftly.
05重 32:36 Indeed the LORD will vindicate his people, have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, neither bond nor free remaining.
05重 32:37 Then he will say: Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
05重 32:38 who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their libations? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection!
05重 32:39 See now that I, even I, am he; there is no god beside me. I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and no one can deliver from my hand.
05重 32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and swear: As I live forever,
05重 32:41 when I whet my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me.
05重 32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh--with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired enemy.
05重 32:43 Praise, O heavens, his people, worship him, all you gods! For he will avenge the blood of his children, and take vengeance on his adversaries; he will repay those who hate him, and cleanse the land for his people.
05重 32:44 Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua son of Nun.
05重 32:45 When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
05重 32:46 he said to them: "Take to heart all the words that I am giving in witness against you today; give them as a command to your children, so that they may diligently observe all the words of this law.
05重 32:47 This is no trifling matter for you, but rather your very life; through it you may live long in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess."
05重 32:48 On that very day the LORD addressed Moses as follows:
05重 32:49 "Ascend this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites for a possession;
05重 32:50 you shall die there on the mountain that you ascend and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin;
05重 32:51 because both of you broke faith with me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, by failing to maintain my holiness among the Israelites.
05重 32:52 Although you may view the land from a distance, you shall not enter it--the land that I am giving to the Israelites."
05重 33:1 This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death.
05重 33:2 He said: The LORD came from Sinai, and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran. With him were myriads of holy ones; at his right, a host of his own.
05重 33:3 Indeed, O favorite among peoples, all his holy ones were in your charge; they marched at your heels, accepted direction from you.
05重 33:4 Moses charged us with the law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
05重 33:5 There arose a king in Jeshurun, when the leaders of the people assembled--the united tribes of Israel.
05重 33:6 May Reuben live, and not die out, even though his numbers are few.
05重 33:7 And this he said of Judah: O LORD, give heed to Judah, and bring him to his people; strengthen his hands for him, and be a help against his adversaries.
05重 33:8 And of Levi he said: Give to Levi your Thummim, and your Urim to your loyal one, whom you tested at Massah, with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah;
05重 33:9 who said of his father and mother, "I regard them not"; he ignored his kin, and did not acknowledge his children. For they observed your word, and kept your covenant.
05重 33:10 They teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law; they place incense before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
05重 33:11 Bless, O LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those that hate him, so that they do not rise again.
05重 33:12 Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the LORD rests in safety--the High God surrounds him all day long--the beloved rests between his shoulders.
05重 33:13 And of Joseph he said: Blessed by the LORD be his land, with the choice gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that lies beneath;
05重 33:14 with the choice fruits of the sun, and the rich yield of the months;
05重 33:15 with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills;
05重 33:16 with the choice gifts of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of the one who dwells on Sinai. Let these come on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
05重 33:17 A firstborn bull--majesty is his! His horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he gores the peoples, driving them to the ends of the earth; such are the myriads of Ephraim, such the thousands of Manasseh.
05重 33:18 And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents.
05重 33:19 They call peoples to the mountain; there they offer the right sacrifices; for they suck the affluence of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.
05重 33:20 And of Gad he said: Blessed be the enlargement of Gad! Gad lives like a lion; he tears at arm and scalp.
05重 33:21 He chose the best for himself, for there a commander's allotment was reserved; he came at the head of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his ordinances for Israel.
05重 33:22 And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp that leaps forth from Bashan.
05重 33:23 And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, sated with favor, full of the blessing of the LORD, possess the west and the south.
05重 33:24 And of Asher he said: Most blessed of sons be Asher; may he be the favorite of his brothers, and may he dip his foot in oil.
05重 33:25 Your bars are iron and bronze; and as your days, so is your strength.
05重 33:26 There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your help, majestic through the skies.
05重 33:27 He subdues the ancient gods, shatters the forces of old; he drove out the enemy before you, and said, "Destroy!"
05重 33:28 So Israel lives in safety, untroubled is Jacob's abode in a land of grain and wine, where the heavens drop down dew.
05重 33:29 Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you, and you shall tread on their backs.
05重 34:1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and the LORD showed him the whole land: Gilead as far as Dan,
05重 34:2 all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,
05重 34:3 the Negeb, and the Plain--that is, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees--as far as Zoar.
05重 34:4 The LORD said to him, "This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants'; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there."
05重 34:5 Then Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, at the LORD's command.
05重 34:6 He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day.
05重 34:7 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died; his sight was unimpaired and his vigor had not abated.
05重 34:8 The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the period of mourning for Moses was ended.
05重 34:9 Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him; and the Israelites obeyed him, doing as the LORD had commanded Moses.
05重 34:10 Never since has there arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.
05重 34:11 He was unequaled for all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants and his entire land,
05重 34:12 and for all the mighty deeds and all the terrifying displays of power that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.

06呪 1:1 After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant, saying,
06呪 1:2 "My servant Moses is dead. Now proceed to cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites.
06呪 1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I promised to Moses.
06呪 1:4 From the wilderness and the Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, to the Great Sea in the west shall be your territory.
06呪 1:5 No one shall be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.
06呪 1:6 Be strong and courageous; for you shall put this people in possession of the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them.
06呪 1:7 Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to act in accordance with all the law that my servant Moses commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, so that you may be successful wherever you go.
06呪 1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to act in accordance with all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall be successful.
06呪 1:9 I hereby command you: Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
06呪 1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,
06呪 1:11 "Pass through the camp, and command the people: 'Prepare your provisions; for in three days you are to cross over the Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess.'"
06呪 1:12 To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,
06呪 1:13 "Remember the word that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God is providing you a place of rest, and will give you this land.'
06呪 1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan. But all the warriors among you shall cross over armed before your kindred and shall help them,
06呪 1:15 until the LORD gives rest to your kindred as well as to you, and they too take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan to the east."
06呪 1:16 They answered Joshua: "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
06呪 1:17 Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses!
06呪 1:18 Whoever rebels against your orders and disobeys your words, whatever you command, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
06呪 2:1 Then Joshua son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night there.
06呪 2:2 The king of Jericho was told, "Some Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land."
06呪 2:3 Then the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come only to search out the whole land."
06呪 2:4 But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, "True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.
06呪 2:5 And when it was time to close the gate at dark, the men went out. Where the men went I do not know. Pursue them quickly, for you can overtake them."
06呪 2:6 She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax that she had laid out on the roof.
06呪 2:7 So the men pursued them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
06呪 2:8 Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof
06呪 2:9 and said to the men: "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before you.
06呪 2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
06呪 2:11 As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any of us because of you. The LORD your God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth below.
06呪 2:12 Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, swear to me by the LORD that you in turn will deal kindly with my family. Give me a sign of good faith
06呪 2:13 that you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."
06呪 2:14 The men said to her, "Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the LORD gives us the land."
06呪 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the outer side of the city wall and she resided within the wall itself.
06呪 2:16 She said to them, "Go toward the hill country, so that the pursuers may not come upon you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; then afterward you may go your way."
06呪 2:17 The men said to her, "We will be released from this oath that you have made us swear to you
06呪 2:18 if we invade the land and you do not tie this crimson cord in the window through which you let us down, and you do not gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your family.
06呪 2:19 If any of you go out of the doors of your house into the street, they shall be responsible for their own death, and we shall be innocent; but if a hand is laid upon any who are with you in the house, we shall bear the responsibility for their death.
06呪 2:20 But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be released from this oath that you made us swear to you."
06呪 2:21 She said, "According to your words, so be it." She sent them away and they departed. Then she tied the crimson cord in the window.
06呪 2:22 They departed and went into the hill country and stayed there three days, until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had searched all along the way and found nothing.
06呪 2:23 Then the two men came down again from the hill country. They crossed over, came to Joshua son of Nun, and told him all that had happened to them.
06呪 2:24 They said to Joshua, "Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands; moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before us."
06呪 3:1 Early in the morning Joshua rose and set out from Shittim with all the Israelites, and they came to the Jordan. They camped there before crossing over.
06呪 3:2 At the end of three days the officers went through the camp
06呪 3:3 and commanded the people, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place. Follow it,
06呪 3:4 so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come any nearer to it."
06呪 3:5 Then Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
06呪 3:6 To the priests Joshua said, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on in front of the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went in front of the people.
06呪 3:7 The LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses.
06呪 3:8 You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, 'When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
06呪 3:9 Joshua then said to the Israelites, "Draw near and hear the words of the LORD your God."
06呪 3:10 Joshua said, "By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites:
06呪 3:11 the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan.
06呪 3:12 So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
06呪 3:13 When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap."
06呪 3:14 When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people.
06呪 3:15 Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water,
06呪 3:16 the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
06呪 3:17 While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.
06呪 4:1 When the entire nation had finished crossing over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua:
06呪 4:2 "Select twelve men from the people, one from each tribe,
06呪 4:3 and command them, 'Take twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood, carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you camp tonight.'"
06呪 4:4 Then Joshua summoned the twelve men from the Israelites, whom he had appointed, one from each tribe.
06呪 4:5 Joshua said to them, "Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the tribes of the Israelites,
06呪 4:6 so that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, 'What do those stones mean to you?'
06呪 4:7 then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off in front of the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the Israelites a memorial forever."
06呪 4:8 The Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD told Joshua, carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.
06呪 4:9 (Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.)
06呪 4:10 The priests who bore the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people crossed over in haste.
06呪 4:11 As soon as all the people had finished crossing over, the ark of the LORD, and the priests, crossed over in front of the people.
06呪 4:12 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them.
06呪 4:13 About forty thousand armed for war crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for battle.
06呪 4:14 On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him, as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.
06呪 4:15 The LORD said to Joshua,
06呪 4:16 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan."
06呪 4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
06呪 4:18 When the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet touched dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.
06呪 4:19 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
06呪 4:20 Those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal,
06呪 4:21 saying to the Israelites, "When your children ask their parents in time to come, 'What do these stones mean?'
06呪 4:22 then you shall let your children know, 'Israel crossed over the Jordan here on dry ground.'
06呪 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you crossed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we crossed over,
06呪 4:24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may fear the LORD your God forever."
06呪 5:1 When all the kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them, because of the Israelites.
06呪 5:2 At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites a second time."
06呪 5:3 So Joshua made flint knives, and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath-haaraloth.
06呪 5:4 This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the warriors, had died during the journey through the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt.
06呪 5:5 Although all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people born on the journey through the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
06呪 5:6 For the Israelites traveled forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the warriors who came out of Egypt, perished, not having listened to the voice of the LORD. To them the LORD swore that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06呪 5:7 So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
06呪 5:8 When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
06呪 5:9 The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt." And so that place is called Gilgal to this day.
06呪 5:10 While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal they kept the passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho.
06呪 5:11 On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
06呪 5:12 The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.
06呪 5:13 Once when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you one of us, or one of our adversaries?"
06呪 5:14 He replied, "Neither; but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and he said to him, "What do you command your servant, my lord?"
06呪 5:15 The commander of the army of the LORD said to Joshua, "Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy." And Joshua did so.
06呪 6:1 Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the Israelites; no one came out and no one went in.
06呪 6:2 The LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have handed Jericho over to you, along with its king and soldiers.
06呪 6:3 You shall march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once. Thus you shall do for six days,
06呪 6:4 with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets.
06呪 6:5 When they make a long blast with the ram's horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and all the people shall charge straight ahead."
06呪 6:6 So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark of the LORD."
06呪 6:7 To the people he said, "Go forward and march around the city; have the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD."
06呪 6:8 As Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.
06呪 6:9 And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets; the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.
06呪 6:10 To the people Joshua gave this command: "You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, nor shall you utter a word, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."
06呪 6:11 So the ark of the LORD went around the city, circling it once; and they came into the camp, and spent the night in the camp.
06呪 6:12 Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
06呪 6:13 The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD passed on, blowing the trumpets continually. The armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually.
06呪 6:14 On the second day they marched around the city once and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
06呪 6:15 On the seventh day they rose early, at dawn, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
06呪 6:16 And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.
06呪 6:17 The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers we sent.
06呪 6:18 As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet and take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.
06呪 6:19 But all silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are sacred to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."
06呪 6:20 So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat; so the people charged straight ahead into the city and captured it.
06呪 6:21 Then they devoted to destruction by the edge of the sword all in the city, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.
06呪 6:22 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring the woman out of it and all who belong to her, as you swore to her."
06呪 6:23 So the young men who had been spies went in and brought Rahab out, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all who belonged to her--they brought all her kindred out--and set them outside the camp of Israel.
06呪 6:24 They burned down the city, and everything in it; only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
06呪 6:25 But Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, Joshua spared. Her family has lived in Israel ever since. For she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
06呪 6:26 Joshua then pronounced this oath, saying, "Cursed before the LORD be anyone who tries to build this city--this Jericho! At the cost of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates!"
06呪 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
06呪 7:1 But the Israelites broke faith in regard to the devoted things: Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.
06呪 7:2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men went up and spied out Ai.
06呪 7:3 Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Not all the people need go up; about two or three thousand men should go up and attack Ai. Since they are so few, do not make the whole people toil up there."
06呪 7:4 So about three thousand of the people went up there; and they fled before the men of Ai.
06呪 7:5 The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim and killing them on the slope. The hearts of the people melted and turned to water.
06呪 7:6 Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
06呪 7:7 Joshua said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Why have you brought this people across the Jordan at all, to hand us over to the Amorites so as to destroy us? Would that we had been content to settle beyond the Jordan!
06呪 7:8 O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned their backs to their enemies!
06呪 7:9 The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will you do for your great name?"
06呪 7:10 The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! Why have you fallen upon your face?
06呪 7:11 Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I imposed on them. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their own belongings.
06呪 7:12 Therefore the Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs to their enemies, because they have become a thing devoted for destruction themselves. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
06呪 7:13 Proceed to sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "There are devoted things among you, O Israel; you will be unable to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you."
06呪 7:14 In the morning therefore you shall come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come near by clans, the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household that the LORD takes shall come near one by one.
06呪 7:15 And the one who is taken as having the devoted things shall be burned with fire, together with all that he has, for having transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and for having done an outrageous thing in Israel.'"
06呪 7:16 So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
06呪 7:17 He brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the clan of the Zerahites, family by family, and Zabdi was taken.
06呪 7:18 And he brought near his household one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
06呪 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."
06呪 7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, "It is true; I am the one who sinned against the LORD God of Israel. This is what I did:
06呪 7:21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. They now lie hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
06呪 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
06呪 7:23 They took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites; and they spread them out before the LORD.
06呪 7:24 Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, with the silver, the mantle, and the bar of gold, with his sons and daughters, with his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, and his tent and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
06呪 7:25 Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD is bringing trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him to death; they burned them with fire, cast stones on them,
06呪 7:26 and raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore that place to this day is called the Valley of Achor.
06呪 8:1 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed; take all the fighting men with you, and go up now to Ai. See, I have handed over to you the king of Ai with his people, his city, and his land.
06呪 8:2 You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its livestock you may take as booty for yourselves. Set an ambush against the city, behind it."
06呪 8:3 So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to go up against Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand warriors and sent them out by night
06呪 8:4 with the command, "You shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but all of you stay alert.
06呪 8:5 I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. When they come out against us, as before, we shall flee from them.
06呪 8:6 They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, as before.' While we flee from them,
06呪 8:7 you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city; for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.
06呪 8:8 And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire, doing as the LORD has ordered; see, I have commanded you."
06呪 8:9 So Joshua sent them out; and they went to the place of ambush, and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that night in the camp.
06呪 8:10 In the morning Joshua rose early and mustered the people, and went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
06呪 8:11 All the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near before the city, and camped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.
06呪 8:12 Taking about five thousand men, he set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
06呪 8:13 So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.
06呪 8:14 When the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the inhabitants of the city, hurried out early in the morning to the meeting place facing the Arabah to meet Israel in battle; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
06呪 8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
06呪 8:16 So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.
06呪 8:17 There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
06呪 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the sword that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the sword that was in his hand toward the city.
06呪 8:19 As soon as he stretched out his hand, the troops in ambush rose quickly out of their place and rushed forward. They entered the city, took it, and at once set the city on fire.
06呪 8:20 So when the men of Ai looked back, the smoke of the city was rising to the sky. They had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.
06呪 8:21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city was rising, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
06呪 8:22 And the others came out from the city against them; so they were surrounded by Israelites, some on one side, and some on the other; and Israel struck them down until no one was left who survived or escaped.
06呪 8:23 But the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
06呪 8:24 When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai, and attacked it with the edge of the sword.
06呪 8:25 The total of those who fell that day, both men and women, was twelve thousand--all the people of Ai.
06呪 8:26 For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the sword, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
06呪 8:27 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their booty, according to the word of the LORD that he had issued to Joshua.
06呪 8:28 So Joshua burned Ai, and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.
06呪 8:29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, threw it down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
06呪 8:30 Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel,
06呪 8:31 just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, "an altar of unhewn stones, on which no iron tool has been used"; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed offerings of well-being.
06呪 8:32 And there, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
06呪 8:33 All Israel, alien as well as citizen, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark in front of the levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
06呪 8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, blessings and curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
06呪 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the aliens who resided among them.
06呪 9:1 Now when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon--the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites--heard of this,
06呪 9:2 they gathered together with one accord to fight Joshua and Israel.
06呪 9:3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
06呪 9:4 they on their part acted with cunning: they went and prepared provisions, and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,
06呪 9:5 with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy.
06呪 9:6 They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the Israelites, "We have come from a far country; so now make a treaty with us."
06呪 9:7 But the Israelites said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a treaty with you?"
06呪 9:8 They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?"
06呪 9:9 They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard a report of him, of all that he did in Egypt,
06呪 9:10 and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth.
06呪 9:11 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey; go to meet them, and say to them, "We are your servants; come now, make a treaty with us."'
06呪 9:12 Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set out to come to you, but now, see, it is dry and moldy;
06呪 9:13 these wineskins were new when we filled them, and see, they are burst; and these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey."
06呪 9:14 So the leaders partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from the LORD.
06呪 9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, guaranteeing their lives by a treaty; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
06呪 9:16 But when three days had passed after they had made a treaty with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and were living among them.
06呪 9:17 So the Israelites set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
06呪 9:18 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.
06呪 9:19 But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we must not touch them.
06呪 9:20 This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath may not come upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them."
06呪 9:21 The leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had decided concerning them.
06呪 9:22 Joshua summoned them, and said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' while in fact you are living among us?
06呪 9:23 Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
06呪 9:24 They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; so we were in great fear for our lives because of you, and did this thing.
06呪 9:25 And now we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us."
06呪 9:26 This is what he did for them: he saved them from the Israelites; and they did not kill them.
06呪 9:27 But on that day Joshua made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to continue to this day, in the place that he should choose.
06呪 10:1 When King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
06呪 10:2 he became greatly frightened, because Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities, and was larger than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
06呪 10:3 So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent a message to King Hoham of Hebron, to King Piram of Jarmuth, to King Japhia of Lachish, and to King Debir of Eglon, saying,
06呪 10:4 "Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the Israelites."
06呪 10:5 Then the five kings of the Amorites--the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon--gathered their forces, and went up with all their armies and camped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
06呪 10:6 And the Gibeonites sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country are gathered against us."
06呪 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting force with him, all the mighty warriors.
06呪 10:8 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have handed them over to you; not one of them shall stand before you."
06呪 10:9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.
06呪 10:10 And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who inflicted a great slaughter on them at Gibeon, chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
06呪 10:11 As they fled before Israel, while they were going down the slope of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down huge stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword.
06呪 10:12 On the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD; and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon."
06呪 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in mid-heaven, and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.
06呪 10:14 There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded a human voice; for the LORD fought for Israel.
06呪 10:15 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
06呪 10:16 Meanwhile, these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
06呪 10:17 And it was told Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
06呪 10:18 Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;
06呪 10:19 but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Do not let them enter their towns, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
06呪 10:20 When Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great slaughter on them, until they were wiped out, and when the survivors had entered into the fortified towns,
06呪 10:21 all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah; no one dared to speak against any of the Israelites.
06呪 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave."
06呪 10:23 They did so, and brought the five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
06呪 10:24 When they brought the kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the Israelites, and said to the chiefs of the warriors who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.
06呪 10:25 And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous; for thus the LORD will do to all the enemies against whom you fight."
06呪 10:26 Afterward Joshua struck them down and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening.
06呪 10:27 At sunset Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves; they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
06呪 10:28 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed every person in it; he left no one remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06呪 10:29 Then Joshua passed on from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
06呪 10:30 The LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left no one remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06呪 10:31 Next Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and laid siege to it, and assaulted it.
06呪 10:32 The LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.
06呪 10:33 Then King Horam of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, leaving him no survivors.
06呪 10:34 From Lachish Joshua passed on with all Israel to Eglon; and they laid siege to it, and assaulted it;
06呪 10:35 and they took it that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword; and every person in it he utterly destroyed that day, as he had done to Lachish.
06呪 10:36 Then Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron; they assaulted it,
06呪 10:37 and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it; he left no one remaining, just as he had done to Eglon, and utterly destroyed it with every person in it.
06呪 10:38 Then Joshua, with all Israel, turned back to Debir and assaulted it,
06呪 10:39 and he took it with its king and all its towns; they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person in it; he left no one remaining; just as he had done to Hebron, and, as he had done to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and its king.
06呪 10:40 So Joshua defeated the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
06呪 10:41 And Joshua defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.
06呪 10:42 Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
06呪 10:43 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
06呪 11:1 When King Jabin of Hazor heard of this, he sent to King Jobab of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,
06呪 11:2 and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west,
06呪 11:3 to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
06呪 11:4 They came out, with all their troops, a great army, in number like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
06呪 11:5 All these kings joined their forces, and came and camped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
06呪 11:6 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will hand over all of them, slain, to Israel; you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
06呪 11:7 So Joshua came suddenly upon them with all his fighting force, by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them.
06呪 11:8 And the LORD handed them over to Israel, who attacked them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, until they had left no one remaining.
06呪 11:9 And Joshua did to them as the LORD commanded him; he hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
06呪 11:10 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king down with the sword. Before that time Hazor was the head of all those kingdoms.
06呪 11:11 And they put to the sword all who were in it, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire.
06呪 11:12 And all the towns of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took, and struck them with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
06呪 11:13 But Israel burned none of the towns that stood on mounds except Hazor, which Joshua did burn.
06呪 11:14 All the spoil of these towns, and the livestock, the Israelites took for their booty; but all the people they struck down with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.
06呪 11:15 As the LORD had commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
06呪 11:16 So Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland,
06呪 11:17 from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them down, and put them to death.
06呪 11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
06呪 11:19 There was not a town that made peace with the Israelites, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all were taken in battle.
06呪 11:20 For it was the LORD's doing to harden their hearts so that they would come against Israel in battle, in order that they might be utterly destroyed, and might receive no mercy, but be exterminated, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06呪 11:21 At that time Joshua came and wiped out the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their towns.
06呪 11:22 None of the Anakim was left in the land of the Israelites; some remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.
06呪 11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.
06呪 12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the Israelites defeated, whose land they occupied beyond the Jordan toward the east, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon, with all the Arabah eastward:
06呪 12:2 King Sihon of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and from the middle of the valley as far as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites, that is, half of Gilead,
06呪 12:3 and the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, to the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
06呪 12:4 and King Og of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
06呪 12:5 and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and over half of Gilead to the boundary of King Sihon of Heshbon.
06呪 12:6 Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave their land for a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06呪 12:7 The following are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir (and Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their allotments,
06呪 12:8 in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negeb, the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):
06呪 12:9 the king of Jericho one the king of Ai, which is next to Bethel one
06呪 12:10 the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one
06呪 12:11 the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one
06呪 12:12 the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one
06呪 12:13 the king of Debir one the king of Geder one
06呪 12:14 the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
06呪 12:15 the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
06呪 12:16 the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
06呪 12:17 the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
06呪 12:18 the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one
06呪 12:19 the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
06呪 12:20 the king of Shimron-meron one the king of Achshaph one
06呪 12:21 the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one
06呪 12:22 the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
06呪 12:23 the king of Dor in Naphath-dor one the king of Goiim in Galilee, one
06呪 12:24 the king of Tirzah one thirty-one kings in all.
06呪 13:1 Now Joshua was old and advanced in years; and the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and very much of the land still remains to be possessed.
06呪 13:2 This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites
06呪 13:3 (from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, it is reckoned as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of the Avvim,
06呪 13:4 in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites,
06呪 13:5 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath,
06呪 13:6 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I will myself drive them out from before the Israelites; only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
06呪 13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
06呪 13:8 With the other half-tribe of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them:
06呪 13:9 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and the town that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland from Medeba as far as Dibon;
06呪 13:10 and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
06呪 13:11 and Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
06呪 13:12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the survivors of the Rephaim); these Moses had defeated and driven out.
06呪 13:13 Yet the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites; but Geshur and Maacath live within Israel to this day.
06呪 13:14 To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to them.
06呪 13:15 Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites according to their clans.
06呪 13:16 Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and the town that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba;
06呪 13:17 with Heshbon, and all its towns that are in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
06呪 13:18 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
06呪 13:19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
06呪 13:20 and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
06呪 13:21 that is, all the towns of the tableland, and all the kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, as princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
06呪 13:22 Along with the rest of those they put to death, the Israelites also put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.
06呪 13:23 And the border of the Reubenites was the Jordan and its banks. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites, according to their families with their towns and villages.
06呪 13:24 Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of the Gadites, according to their families.
06呪 13:25 Their territory was Jazer, and all the towns of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah,
06呪 13:26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir,
06呪 13:27 and in the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon, the Jordan and its banks, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan.
06呪 13:28 This is the inheritance of the Gadites according to their clans, with their towns and villages.
06呪 13:29 Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was allotted to the half-tribe of the Manassites according to their families.
06呪 13:30 Their territory extended from Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of King Og of Bashan, and all the settlements of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty towns,
06呪 13:31 and half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the people of Machir son of Manasseh according to their clans--for half the Machirites.
06呪 13:32 These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
06呪 13:33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said to them.
06呪 14:1 These are the inheritances that the Israelites received in the land of Canaan, which the priest Eleazar, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites distributed to them.
06呪 14:2 Their inheritance was by lot, as the LORD had commanded Moses for the nine and one-half tribes.
06呪 14:3 For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
06呪 14:4 For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only towns to live in, with their pasture lands for their flocks and herds.
06呪 14:5 The Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.
06呪 14:6 Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal; and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me.
06呪 14:7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him an honest report.
06呪 14:8 But my companions who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.
06呪 14:9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.'
06呪 14:10 And now, as you see, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel was journeying through the wilderness; and here I am today, eighty-five years old.
06呪 14:11 I am still as strong today as I was on the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war, and for going and coming.
06呪 14:12 So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day; for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; it may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the LORD said."
06呪 14:13 Then Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
06呪 14:14 So Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholeheartedly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
06呪 14:15 Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba; this Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
06呪 15:1 The lot for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their families reached southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south.
06呪 15:2 And their south boundary ran from the end of the Dead Sea, from the bay that faces southward;
06呪 15:3 it goes out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, makes a turn to Karka,
06呪 15:4 passes along to Azmon, goes out by the Wadi of Egypt, and comes to its end at the sea. This shall be your south boundary.
06呪 15:5 And the east boundary is the Dead Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan;
06呪 15:6 and the boundary goes up to Beth-hoglah, and passes along north of Beth-arabah; and the boundary goes up to the Stone of Bohan, Reuben's son;
06呪 15:7 and the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh, and ends at En-rogel;
06呪 15:8 then the boundary goes up by the valley of the son of Hinnom at the southern slope of the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem); and the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim;
06呪 15:9 then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the towns of Mount Ephron; then the boundary bends around to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim);
06呪 15:10 and the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh, and passes along by Timnah;
06呪 15:11 the boundary goes out to the slope of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends around to Shikkeron, and passes along to Mount Baalah, and goes out to Jabneel; then the boundary comes to an end at the sea.
06呪 15:12 And the west boundary was the Mediterranean with its coast. This is the boundary surrounding the people of Judah according to their families.
06呪 15:13 According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, he gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).
06呪 15:14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
06呪 15:15 From there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
06呪 15:16 And Caleb said, "Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife."
06呪 15:17 Othniel son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.
06呪 15:18 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, "What do you wish?"
06呪 15:19 She said to him, "Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me springs of water as well." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
06呪 15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Judah according to their families.
06呪 15:21 The towns belonging to the tribe of the people of Judah in the extreme South, toward the boundary of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
06呪 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
06呪 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
06呪 15:24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
06呪 15:25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
06呪 15:26 Amam, Shema, Moladah,
06呪 15:27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
06呪 15:28 Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, Biziothiah,
06呪 15:29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
06呪 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
06呪 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
06呪 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: in all, twenty-nine towns, with their villages.
06呪 15:33 And in the Lowland, Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
06呪 15:34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
06呪 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
06呪 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, Gederothaim: fourteen towns with their villages.
06呪 15:37 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
06呪 15:38 Dilan, Mizpeh, Jokthe-el,
06呪 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
06呪 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish,
06呪 15:41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen towns with their villages.
06呪 15:42 Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
06呪 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
06呪 15:44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine towns with their villages.
06呪 15:45 Ekron, with its dependencies and its villages;
06呪 15:46 from Ekron to the sea, all that were near Ashdod, with their villages.
06呪 15:47 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the Wadi of Egypt, and the Great Sea with its coast.
06呪 15:48 And in the hill country, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
06呪 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
06呪 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06呪 15:51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven towns with their villages.
06呪 15:52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06呪 15:53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
06呪 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior: nine towns with their villages.
06呪 15:55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06呪 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06呪 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten towns with their villages.
06呪 15:58 Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
06呪 15:59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon: six towns with their villages.
06呪 15:60 Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah: two towns with their villages.
06呪 15:61 In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
06呪 15:62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi: six towns with their villages.
06呪 15:63 But the people of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so the Jebusites live with the people of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
06呪 16:1 The allotment of the Josephites went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel;
06呪 16:2 then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites;
06呪 16:3 then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.
06呪 16:4 The Josephites--Manasseh and Ephraim--received their inheritance.
06呪 16:5 The territory of the Ephraimites by their families was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon,
06呪 16:6 and the boundary goes from there to the sea; on the north is Michmethath; then on the east the boundary makes a turn toward Taanath-shiloh, and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah,
06呪 16:7 then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan.
06呪 16:8 From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the Wadi Kanah, and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites by their families,
06呪 16:9 together with the towns that were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages.
06呪 16:10 They did not, however, drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer: so the Canaanites have lived within Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor.
06呪 17:1 Then allotment was made to the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a warrior.
06呪 17:2 And allotments were made to the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, by their families, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, by their families.
06呪 17:3 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh had no sons, but only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
06呪 17:4 They came before the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun and the leaders, and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our male kin." So according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the kinsmen of their father.
06呪 17:5 Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan,
06呪 17:6 because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the Manassites.
06呪 17:7 The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem; then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
06呪 17:8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the Ephraimites.
06呪 17:9 Then the boundary went down to the Wadi Kanah. The towns here, to the south of the wadi, among the towns of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes along the north side of the wadi and ends at the sea.
06呪 17:10 The land to the south is Ephraim's and that to the north is Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary; on the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar.
06呪 17:11 Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages (the third is Naphath).
06呪 17:12 Yet the Manassites could not take possession of those towns; but the Canaanites continued to live in that land.
06呪 17:13 But when the Israelites grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
06呪 17:14 The tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, whom all along the LORD has blessed?"
06呪 17:15 And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear ground there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
06呪 17:16 The tribe of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us; yet all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel."
06呪 17:17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are indeed a numerous people, and have great power; you shall not have one lot only,
06呪 17:18 but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
06呪 18:1 Then the whole congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there. The land lay subdued before them.
06呪 18:2 There remained among the Israelites seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned.
06呪 18:3 So Joshua said to the Israelites, "How long will you be slack about going in and taking possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you?
06呪 18:4 Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may begin to go throughout the land, writing a description of it with a view to their inheritances. Then come back to me.
06呪 18:5 They shall divide it into seven portions, Judah continuing in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph in their territory on the north.
06呪 18:6 You shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
06呪 18:7 The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage; and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
06呪 18:8 So the men started on their way; and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, "Go throughout the land and write a description of it, and come back to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
06呪 18:9 So the men went and traversed the land and set down in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions; then they came back to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh,
06呪 18:10 and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD; and there Joshua apportioned the land to the Israelites, to each a portion.
06呪 18:11 The lot of the tribe of Benjamin according to its families came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Joseph.
06呪 18:12 On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan; then the boundary goes up to the slope of Jericho on the north, then up through the hill country westward; and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
06呪 18:13 From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the slope of Luz (that is, Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.
06呪 18:14 Then the boundary goes in another direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a town belonging to the tribe of Judah. This forms the western side.
06呪 18:15 The southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim; and the boundary goes from there to Ephron, to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah;
06呪 18:16 then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the valley of Rephaim; and it then goes down the valley of Hinnom, south of the slope of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel;
06呪 18:17 then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and from there goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim; then it goes down to the Stone of Bohan, Reuben's son;
06呪 18:18 and passing on to the north of the slope of Beth-arabah it goes down to the Arabah;
06呪 18:19 then the boundary passes on to the north of the slope of Beth-hoglah; and the boundary ends at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this is the southern border.
06呪 18:20 The Jordan forms its boundary on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, according to its families, boundary by boundary all around.
06呪 18:21 Now the towns of the tribe of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
06呪 18:22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
06呪 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
06呪 18:24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba--twelve towns with their villages:
06呪 18:25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
06呪 18:26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
06呪 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
06呪 18:28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath-jearim--fourteen towns with their villages. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin according to its families.
06呪 19:1 The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of Simeon, according to its families; its inheritance lay within the inheritance of the tribe of Judah.
06呪 19:2 It had for its inheritance Beer-sheba, Sheba, Moladah,
06呪 19:3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
06呪 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
06呪 19:5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
06呪 19:6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen--thirteen towns with their villages;
06呪 19:7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan--four towns with their villages;
06呪 19:8 together with all the villages all around these towns as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negeb. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon according to its families.
06呪 19:9 The inheritance of the tribe of Simeon formed part of the territory of Judah; because the portion of the tribe of Judah was too large for them, the tribe of Simeon obtained an inheritance within their inheritance.
06呪 19:10 The third lot came up for the tribe of Zebulun, according to its families. The boundary of its inheritance reached as far as Sarid;
06呪 19:11 then its boundary goes up westward, and on to Maralah, and touches Dabbesheth, then the wadi that is east of Jokneam;
06呪 19:12 from Sarid it goes in the other direction eastward toward the sunrise to the boundary of Chisloth-tabor; from there it goes to Daberath, then up to Japhia;
06呪 19:13 from there it passes along on the east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and going on to Rimmon it bends toward Neah;
06呪 19:14 then on the north the boundary makes a turn to Hannathon, and it ends at the valley of Iphtah-el;
06呪 19:15 and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem--twelve towns with their villages.
06呪 19:16 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun, according to its families--these towns with their villages.
06呪 19:17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the tribe of Issachar, according to its families.
06呪 19:18 Its territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,
06呪 19:19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
06呪 19:20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
06呪 19:21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, Beth-pazzez;
06呪 19:22 the boundary also touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and its boundary ends at the Jordan--sixteen towns with their villages.
06呪 19:23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, according to its families--the towns with their villages.
06呪 19:24 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher according to its families.
06呪 19:25 Its boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
06呪 19:26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal; on the west it touches Carmel and Shihor-libnath,
06呪 19:27 then it turns eastward, goes to Beth-dagon, and touches Zebulun and the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it continues in the north to Cabul,
06呪 19:28 Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, as far as Sidon the Great;
06呪 19:29 then the boundary turns to Ramah, reaching to the fortified city of Tyre; then the boundary turns to Hosah, and it ends at the sea; Mahalab, Achzib,
06呪 19:30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob--twenty-two towns with their villages.
06呪 19:31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Asher according to its families--these towns with their villages.
06呪 19:32 The sixth lot came out for the tribe of Naphtali, for the tribe of Naphtali, according to its families.
06呪 19:33 And its boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; and it ended at the Jordan;
06呪 19:34 then the boundary turns westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goes from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun at the south, and Asher on the west, and Judah on the east at the Jordan.
06呪 19:35 The fortified towns are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
06呪 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
06呪 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,
06呪 19:38 Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh--nineteen towns with their villages.
06呪 19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali according to its families--the towns with their villages.
06呪 19:40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan, according to its families.
06呪 19:41 The territory of its inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,

06呪 19:45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
06呪 19:46 Me-jarkon, and Rakkon at the border opposite Joppa.
06呪 19:47 When the territory of the Danites was lost to them, the Danites went up and fought against Leshem, and after capturing it and putting it to the sword, they took possession of it and settled in it, calling Leshem, Dan, after their ancestor Dan.
06呪 19:48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to their families--these towns with their villages.
06呪 19:49 When they had finished distributing the several territories of the land as inheritances, the Israelites gave an inheritance among them to Joshua son of Nun.
06呪 19:50 By command of the LORD they gave him the town that he asked for, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim; he rebuilt the town, and settled in it.
06呪 19:51 These are the inheritances that the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites distributed by lot at Shiloh before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
06呪 20:1 Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
06呪 20:2 "Say to the Israelites, 'Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
06呪 20:3 so that anyone who kills a person without intent or by mistake may flee there; they shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.
06呪 20:4 The slayer shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and explain the case to the elders of that city; then the fugitive shall be taken into the city, and given a place, and shall remain with them.
06呪 20:5 And if the avenger of blood is in pursuit, they shall not give up the slayer, because the neighbor was killed by mistake, there having been no enmity between them before.
06呪 20:6 The slayer shall remain in that city until there is a trial before the congregation, until the death of the one who is high priest at the time: then the slayer may return home, to the town in which the deed was done.'"
06呪 20:7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06呪 20:8 And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.
06呪 20:9 These were the cities designated for all the Israelites, and for the aliens residing among them, that anyone who killed a person without intent could flee there, so as not to die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until there was a trial before the congregation.
06呪 21:1 Then the heads of the families of the Levites came to the priest Eleazar and to Joshua son of Nun and to the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites;
06呪 21:2 they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, "The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given towns to live in, along with their pasture lands for our livestock."
06呪 21:3 So by command of the LORD the Israelites gave to the Levites the following towns and pasture lands out of their inheritance.
06呪 21:4 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
06呪 21:5 The rest of the Kohathites received by lot ten towns from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06呪 21:6 The Gershonites received by lot thirteen towns from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06呪 21:7 The Merarites according to their families received twelve towns from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun.
06呪 21:8 These towns and their pasture lands the Israelites gave by lot to the Levites, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06呪 21:9 Out of the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon they gave the following towns mentioned by name,
06呪 21:10 which went to the descendants of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites who belonged to the Levites, since the lot fell to them first.
06呪 21:11 They gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture lands around it.
06呪 21:12 But the fields of the town and its villages had been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his holding.
06呪 21:13 To the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands, Libnah with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:14 Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoa with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:15 Holon with its pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:16 Ain with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands--nine towns out of these two tribes.
06呪 21:17 Out of the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:18 Anathoth with its pasture lands, and Almon with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:19 The towns of the descendants of Aaron--the priests--were thirteen in all, with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:20 As to the rest of the Kohathites belonging to the Kohathite families of the Levites, the towns allotted to them were out of the tribe of Ephraim.
06呪 21:21 To them were given Shechem, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:22 Kibzaim with its pasture lands, and Beth-horon with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:23 Out of the tribe of Dan: Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:24 Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:25 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh: Taanach with its pasture lands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands--two towns.
06呪 21:26 The towns of the families of the rest of the Kohathites were ten in all, with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:27 To the Gershonites, one of the families of the Levites, were given out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, and Beeshterah with its pasture lands--two towns.
06呪 21:28 Out of the tribe of Issachar: Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:29 Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands--four towns;
06呪 21:30 Out of the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:31 Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:32 Out of the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands, and Kartan with its pasture lands--three towns.
06呪 21:33 The towns of the several families of the Gershonites were in all thirteen, with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:34 To the rest of the Levites--the Merarite families--were given out of the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam with its pasture lands, Kartah with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:35 Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:36 Out of the tribe of Reuben: Bezer with its pasture lands, Jahzah with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:37 Kedemoth with its pasture lands, and Mephaath with its pasture lands--four towns.
06呪 21:38 Out of the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, Mahanaim with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:39 Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands--four towns in all.
06呪 21:40 As for the towns of the several Merarite families, that is, the remainder of the families of the Levites, those allotted to them were twelve in all.
06呪 21:41 The towns of the Levites within the holdings of the Israelites were in all forty-eight towns with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:42 Each of these towns had its pasture lands around it; so it was with all these towns.
06呪 21:43 Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to their ancestors that he would give them; and having taken possession of it, they settled there.
06呪 21:44 And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their ancestors; not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands.
06呪 21:45 Not one of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
06呪 22:1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
06呪 22:2 and said to them, "You have observed all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed me in all that I have commanded you;
06呪 22:3 you have not forsaken your kindred these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.
06呪 22:4 And now the LORD your God has given rest to your kindred, as he promised them; therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
06呪 22:5 Take good care to observe the commandment and instruction that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, and to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
06呪 22:6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
06呪 22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their fellow Israelites in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents and blessed them,
06呪 22:8 he said to them, "Go back to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with a great quantity of clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your kindred."
06呪 22:9 So the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the Israelites at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had taken possession by command of the LORD through Moses.
06呪 22:10 When they came to the region near the Jordan that lies in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of great size.
06呪 22:11 The Israelites heard that the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region near the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the Israelites.
06呪 22:12 And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh, to make war against them.
06呪 22:13 Then the Israelites sent the priest Phinehas son of Eleazar to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead,
06呪 22:14 and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
06呪 22:15 They came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,
06呪 22:16 "Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away today from following the LORD, by building yourselves an altar today in rebellion against the LORD?
06呪 22:17 Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which a plague came upon the congregation of the LORD,
06呪 22:18 that you must turn away today from following the LORD! If you rebel against the LORD today, he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.
06呪 22:19 But now, if your land is unclean, cross over into the LORD's land where the LORD's tabernacle now stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us; only do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
06呪 22:20 Did not Achan son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity!'"
06呪 22:21 Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,
06呪 22:22 "The LORD, God of gods! The LORD, God of gods! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith toward the LORD, do not spare us today
06呪 22:23 for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or offerings of well-being on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.
06呪 22:24 No! We did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, 'What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
06呪 22:25 For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites; you have no portion in the LORD.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.
06呪 22:26 Therefore we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,
06呪 22:27 but to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and offerings of well-being; so that your children may never say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'
06呪 22:28 And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we could say, 'Look at this copy of the altar of the LORD, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.'
06呪 22:29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"
06呪 22:30 When the priest Phinehas and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manassites spoke, they were satisfied.
06呪 22:31 The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manassites, "Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD; now you have saved the Israelites from the hand of the LORD."
06呪 22:32 Then the priest Phinehas son of Eleazar and the chiefs returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the Israelites, and brought back word to them.
06呪 22:33 The report pleased the Israelites; and the Israelites blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them, to destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were settled.
06呪 22:34 The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness; "For," said they, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
06呪 23:1 A long time afterward, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,
06呪 23:2 Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders and heads, their judges and officers, and said to them, "I am now old and well advanced in years;
06呪 23:3 and you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you.
06呪 23:4 I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
06呪 23:5 The LORD your God will push them back before you, and drive them out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God promised you.
06呪 23:6 Therefore be very steadfast to observe and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left,
06呪 23:7 so that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you, or make mention of the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow yourselves down to them,
06呪 23:8 but hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
06呪 23:9 For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, no one has been able to withstand you to this day.
06呪 23:10 One of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God who fights for you, as he promised you.
06呪 23:11 Be very careful, therefore, to love the LORD your God.
06呪 23:12 For if you turn back, and join the survivors of these nations left here among you, and intermarry with them, so that you marry their women and they yours,
06呪 23:13 know assuredly that the LORD your God will not continue to drive out these nations before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a scourge on your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you.
06呪 23:14 "And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one thing has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you; all have come to pass for you, not one of them has failed.
06呪 23:15 But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the bad things, until he has destroyed you from this good land that the LORD your God has given you.
06呪 23:16 If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he enjoined on you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you."
06呪 24:1 Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God.
06呪 24:2 And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors--Terah and his sons Abraham and Nahor--lived beyond the Euphrates and served other gods.
06呪 24:3 Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac;
06呪 24:4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
06呪 24:5 Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterwards I brought you out.
06呪 24:6 When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
06呪 24:7 When they cried out to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did to Egypt. Afterwards you lived in the wilderness a long time.
06呪 24:8 Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I handed them over to you, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
06呪 24:9 Then King Balak son of Zippor of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent and invited Balaam son of Beor to curse you,
06呪 24:10 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I rescued you out of his hand.
06呪 24:11 When you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I handed them over to you.
06呪 24:12 I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove out before you the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.
06呪 24:13 I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and towns that you had not built, and you live in them; you eat the fruit of vineyards and oliveyards that you did not plant.
06呪 24:14 "Now therefore revere the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
06呪 24:15 Now if you are unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."
06呪 24:16 Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods;
06呪 24:17 for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight. He protected us along all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed;
06呪 24:18 and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."
06呪 24:19 But Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
06呪 24:20 If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good."
06呪 24:21 And the people said to Joshua, "No, we will serve the LORD!"
06呪 24:22 Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses."
06呪 24:23 He said, "Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06呪 24:24 The people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and him we will obey."
06呪 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.
06呪 24:26 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the LORD.
06呪 24:27 Joshua said to all the people, "See, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, if you deal falsely with your God."
06呪 24:28 So Joshua sent the people away to their inheritances.
06呪 24:29 After these things Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred ten years old.
06呪 24:30 They buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
06呪 24:31 Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the LORD did for Israel.
06呪 24:32 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the portion of ground that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
06呪 24:33 Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had been given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
07
07資 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
07資 1:2 The LORD said, "Judah shall go up. I hereby give the land into his hand."
07資 1:3 Judah said to his brother Simeon, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him.
07資 1:4 Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.
07資 1:5 They came upon Adoni-bezek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
07資 1:6 Adoni-bezek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07資 1:7 Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has paid me back." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07資 1:8 Then the people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.
07資 1:9 Afterward the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.
07資 1:10 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
07資 1:11 From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher).
07資 1:12 Then Caleb said, "Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as wife."
07資 1:13 And Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.
07資 1:14 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, "What do you wish?"
07資 1:15 She said to him, "Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also Gulloth-mayim." So Caleb gave her Upper Gulloth and Lower Gulloth.
07資 1:16 The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad. Then they went and settled with the Amalekites.
07資 1:17 Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and devoted it to destruction. So the city was called Hormah.
07資 1:18 Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
07資 1:19 The LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.
07資 1:20 Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.
07資 1:21 But the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived in Jerusalem among the Benjaminites to this day.
07資 1:22 The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and the LORD was with them.
07資 1:23 The house of Joseph sent out spies to Bethel (the name of the city was formerly Luz).
07資 1:24 When the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, "Show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."
07資 1:25 So he showed them the way into the city; and they put the city to the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
07資 1:26 So the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and named it Luz; that is its name to this day.
07資 1:27 Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; but the Canaanites continued to live in that land.
07資 1:28 When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not in fact drive them out.
07資 1:29 And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.
07資 1:30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
07資 1:31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob;
07資 1:32 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
07資 1:33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
07資 1:34 The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country; they did not allow them to come down to the plain.
07資 1:35 The Amorites continued to live in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.
07資 1:36 The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
07資 2:1 Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, "I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you into the land that I had promised to your ancestors. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
07資 2:2 For your part, do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; tear down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my command. See what you have done!
07資 2:3 So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you."
07資 2:4 When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
07資 2:5 So they named that place Bochim, and there they sacrificed to the LORD.
07資 2:6 When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites all went to their own inheritances to take possession of the land.
07資 2:7 The people worshiped the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel.
07資 2:8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred ten years.
07資 2:9 So they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
07資 2:10 Moreover, that whole generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation grew up after them, who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.
07資 2:11 Then the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and worshiped the Baals;
07資 2:12 and they abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were all around them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger.
07資 2:13 They abandoned the LORD, and worshiped Baal and the Astartes.
07資 2:14 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers who plundered them, and he sold them into the power of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
07資 2:15 Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them to bring misfortune, as the LORD had warned them and sworn to them; and they were in great distress.
07資 2:16 Then the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the power of those who plundered them.
07資 2:17 Yet they did not listen even to their judges; for they lusted after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their ancestors had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD; they did not follow their example.
07資 2:18 Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those who persecuted and oppressed them.
07資 2:19 But whenever the judge died, they would relapse and behave worse than their ancestors, following other gods, worshiping them and bowing down to them. They would not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
07資 2:20 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel; and he said, "Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors, and have not obeyed my voice,
07資 2:21 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died."
07資 2:22 In order to test Israel, whether or not they would take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their ancestors did,
07資 2:23 the LORD had left those nations, not driving them out at once, and had not handed them over to Joshua.
07資 3:1 Now these are the nations that the LORD left to test all those in Israel who had no experience of any war in Canaan
07資 3:2 (it was only that successive generations of Israelites might know war, to teach those who had no experience of it before):
07資 3:3 the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
07資 3:4 They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their ancestors by Moses.
07資 3:5 So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
07資 3:6 and they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and their own daughters they gave to their sons; and they worshiped their gods.
07資 3:7 The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, forgetting the LORD their God, and worshiping the Baals and the Asherahs.
07資 3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim; and the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
07資 3:9 But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the Israelites, who delivered them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
07資 3:10 The spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and the LORD gave King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
07資 3:11 So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
07資 3:12 The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
07資 3:13 In alliance with the Ammonites and the Amalekites, he went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.
07資 3:14 So the Israelites served King Eglon of Moab eighteen years.
07資 3:15 But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The Israelites sent tribute by him to King Eglon of Moab.
07資 3:16 Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he fastened it on his right thigh under his clothes.
07資 3:17 Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
07資 3:18 When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent the people who carried the tribute on their way.
07資 3:19 But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." So the king said, "Silence!" and all his attendants went out from his presence.
07資 3:20 Ehud came to him, while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber, and said, "I have a message from God for you." So he rose from his seat.
07資 3:21 Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon's belly;
07資 3:22 the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
07資 3:23 Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the roof chamber on him, and locked them.
07資 3:24 After he had gone, the servants came. When they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "He must be relieving himself in the cool chamber."
07資 3:25 So they waited until they were embarrassed. When he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them. There was their lord lying dead on the floor.
07資 3:26 Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Seirah.
07資 3:27 When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.
07資 3:28 He said to them, "Follow after me; for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him, and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed no one to cross over.
07資 3:29 At that time they killed about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; no one escaped.
07資 3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
07資 3:31 After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad. He too delivered Israel.
07資 4:1 The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died.
07資 4:2 So the LORD sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim.
07資 4:3 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.
07資 4:4 At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel.
07資 4:5 She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment.
07資 4:6 She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, 'Go, take position at Mount Tabor, bringing ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun.
07資 4:7 I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.'"
07資 4:8 Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
07資 4:9 And she said, "I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
07資 4:10 Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and ten thousand warriors went up behind him; and Deborah went up with him.
07資 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, that is, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had encamped as far away as Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
07資 4:12 When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
07資 4:13 Sisera called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the troops who were with him, from Harosheth-ha-goiim to the Wadi Kishon.
07資 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day on which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. The LORD is indeed going out before you." So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand warriors following him.
07資 4:15 And the LORD threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into a panic before Barak; Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot,
07資 4:16 while Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-ha-goiim. All the army of Sisera fell by the sword; no one was left.
07資 4:17 Now Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the clan of Heber the Kenite.
07資 4:18 Jael came out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
07資 4:19 Then he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
07資 4:20 He said to her, "Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anybody comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'"
07資 4:21 But Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, until it went down into the ground--he was lying fast asleep from weariness--and he died.
07資 4:22 Then, as Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went into her tent; and there was Sisera lying dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
07資 4:23 So on that day God subdued King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites.
07資 4:24 Then the hand of the Israelites bore harder and harder on King Jabin of Canaan, until they destroyed King Jabin of Canaan.
07資 5:1 Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:
07資 5:2 "When locks are long in Israel, when the people offer themselves willingly--bless the LORD!
07資 5:3 "Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the LORD I will sing, I will make melody to the LORD, the God of Israel.
07資 5:4 "LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens poured, the clouds indeed poured water.
07資 5:5 The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.
07資 5:6 "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, caravans ceased and travelers kept to the byways.
07資 5:7 The peasantry prospered in Israel, they grew fat on plunder, because you arose, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel.
07資 5:8 When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?
07資 5:9 My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD.
07資 5:10 "Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way.
07資 5:11 To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the triumphs of the LORD, the triumphs of his peasantry in Israel. "Then down to the gates marched the people of the LORD.
07資 5:12 "Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam.
07資 5:13 Then down marched the remnant of the noble; the people of the LORD marched down for him against the mighty.
07資 5:14 From Ephraim they set out into the valley, following you, Benjamin, with your kin; from Machir marched down the commanders, and from Zebulun those who bear the marshal's staff;
07資 5:15 the chiefs of Issachar came with Deborah, and Issachar faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed out at his heels. Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
07資 5:16 Why did you tarry among the sheepfolds, to hear the piping for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
07資 5:17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why did he abide with the ships? Asher sat still at the coast of the sea, settling down by his landings.
07資 5:18 Zebulun is a people that scorned death; Naphtali too, on the heights of the field.
07資 5:19 "The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they got no spoils of silver.
07資 5:20 The stars fought from heaven, from their courses they fought against Sisera.
07資 5:21 The torrent Kishon swept them away, the onrushing torrent, the torrent Kishon. March on, my soul, with might!
07資 5:22 "Then loud beat the horses' hoofs with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.
07資 5:23 "Curse Meroz, says the angel of the LORD, curse bitterly its inhabitants, because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
07資 5:24 "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed.
07資 5:25 He asked water and she gave him milk, she brought him curds in a lordly bowl.
07資 5:26 She put her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen's mallet; she struck Sisera a blow, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.
07資 5:27 He sank, he fell, he lay still at her feet; at her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell dead.
07資 5:28 "Out of the window she peered, the mother of Sisera gazed through the lattice: 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?'
07資 5:29 Her wisest ladies make answer, indeed, she answers the question herself:
07資 5:30 'Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?--A girl or two for every man; spoil of dyed stuffs for Sisera, spoil of dyed stuffs embroidered, two pieces of dyed work embroidered for my neck as spoil?'
07資 5:31 "So perish all your enemies, O LORD! But may your friends be like the sun as it rises in its might." And the land had rest forty years.
07資 6:1 The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years.
07資 6:2 The hand of Midian prevailed over Israel; and because of Midian the Israelites provided for themselves hiding places in the mountains, caves and strongholds.
07資 6:3 For whenever the Israelites put in seed, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.
07資 6:4 They would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep or ox or donkey.
07資 6:5 For they and their livestock would come up, and they would even bring their tents, as thick as locusts; neither they nor their camels could be counted; so they wasted the land as they came in.
07資 6:6 Thus Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian; and the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help.
07資 6:7 When the Israelites cried to the LORD on account of the Midianites,
07資 6:8 the LORD sent a prophet to the Israelites; and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery;
07資 6:9 and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you, and gave you their land;
07資 6:10 and I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not pay reverence to the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not given heed to my voice."
07資 6:11 Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
07資 6:12 The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, you mighty warrior."
07資 6:13 Gideon answered him, "But sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian."
07資 6:14 Then the LORD turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian; I hereby commission you."
07資 6:15 He responded, "But sir, how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."
07資 6:16 The LORD said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike down the Midianites, every one of them."
07資 6:17 Then he said to him, "If now I have found favor with you, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.
07資 6:18 Do not depart from here until I come to you, and bring out my present, and set it before you." And he said, "I will stay until you return."
07資 6:19 So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them.
07資 6:20 The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so.
07資 6:21 Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
07資 6:22 Then Gideon perceived that it was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon said, "Help me, Lord GOD! For I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."
07資 6:23 But the LORD said to him, "Peace be to you; do not fear, you shall not die."
07資 6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it, The LORD is peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.
07資 6:25 That night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull, the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the sacred pole that is beside it;
07資 6:26 and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, in proper order; then take the second bull, and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the sacred pole that you shall cut down."
07資 6:27 So Gideon took ten of his servants, and did as the LORD had told him; but because he was too afraid of his family and the townspeople to do it by day, he did it by night.
07資 6:28 When the townspeople rose early in the morning, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the sacred pole beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.
07資 6:29 So they said to one another, "Who has done this?" After searching and inquiring, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it."
07資 6:30 Then the townspeople said to Joash, "Bring out your son, so that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred pole beside it."
07資 6:31 But Joash said to all who were arrayed against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you defend his cause? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been pulled down."
07資 6:32 Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he pulled down his altar.
07資 6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and crossing the Jordan they encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.
07資 6:34 But the spirit of the LORD took possession of Gideon; and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.
07資 6:35 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.
07資 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "In order to see whether you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have said,
07資 6:37 I am going to lay a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have said."
07資 6:38 And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
07資 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Do not let your anger burn against me, let me speak one more time; let me, please, make trial with the fleece just once more; let it be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."
07資 6:40 And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
07資 7:1 Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the troops that were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was north of them, below the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
07資 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "The troops with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand. Israel would only take the credit away from me, saying, 'My own hand has delivered me.'
07資 7:3 Now therefore proclaim this in the hearing of the troops, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.'" Thus Gideon sifted them out; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.
07資 7:4 Then the LORD said to Gideon, "The troops are still too many; take them down to the water and I will sift them out for you there. When I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you; and when I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."
07資 7:5 So he brought the troops down to the water; and the LORD said to Gideon, "All those who lap the water with their tongues, as a dog laps, you shall put to one side; all those who kneel down to drink, putting their hands to their mouths, you shall put to the other side."
07資 7:6 The number of those that lapped was three hundred; but all the rest of the troops knelt down to drink water.
07資 7:7 Then the LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go to their homes."
07資 7:8 So he took the jars of the troops from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel back to their own tents, but retained the three hundred. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
07資 7:9 That same night the LORD said to him, "Get up, attack the camp; for I have given it into your hand.
07資 7:10 But if you fear to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah;
07資 7:11 and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to attack the camp." Then he went down with his servant Purah to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp.
07資 7:12 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley as thick as locusts; and their camels were without number, countless as the sand on the seashore.
07資 7:13 When Gideon arrived, there was a man telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, "I had a dream, and in it a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell; it turned upside down, and the tent collapsed."
07資 7:14 And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Midian and all the army."
07資 7:15 When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Get up; for the LORD has given the army of Midian into your hand."
07資 7:16 After he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty jars, with torches inside the jars,
07資 7:17 he said to them, "Look at me, and do the same; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
07資 7:18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets around the whole camp, and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!'"
07資 7:19 So Gideon and the hundred who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
07資 7:20 So the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
07資 7:21 Every man stood in his place all around the camp, and all the men in camp ran; they cried out and fled.
07資 7:22 When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
07資 7:23 And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.
07資 7:24 Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.
07資 7:25 They captured the two captains of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
07資 8:1 Then the Ephraimites said to him, "What have you done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against the Midianites?" And they upbraided him violently.
07資 8:2 So he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
07資 8:3 God has given into your hands the captains of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you?" When he said this, their anger against him subsided.
07資 8:4 Then Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the three hundred who were with him, exhausted and famished.
07資 8:5 So he said to the people of Succoth, "Please give some loaves of bread to my followers, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07資 8:6 But the officials of Succoth said, "Do you already have in your possession the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna, that we should give bread to your army?"
07資 8:7 Gideon replied, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will trample your flesh on the thorns of the wilderness and on briers."
07資 8:8 From there he went up to Penuel, and made the same request of them; and the people of Penuel answered him as the people of Succoth had answered.
07資 8:9 So he said to the people of Penuel, "When I come back victorious, I will break down this tower."
07資 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred twenty thousand men bearing arms had fallen.
07資 8:11 So Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard.
07資 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued them and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and threw all the army into a panic.
07資 8:13 When Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres,
07資 8:14 he caught a young man, one of the people of Succoth, and questioned him; and he listed for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven people.
07資 8:15 Then he came to the people of Succoth, and said, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Do you already have in your possession the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna, that we should give bread to your troops who are exhausted?'"
07資 8:16 So he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he trampled the people of Succoth.
07資 8:17 He also broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
07資 8:18 Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What about the men whom you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they, every one of them; they resembled the sons of a king."
07資 8:19 And he replied, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you."
07資 8:20 So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Go kill them!" But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a boy.
07資 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "You come and kill us; for as the man is, so is his strength." So Gideon proceeded to kill Zebah and Zalmunna; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.
07資 8:22 Then the Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Midian."
07資 8:23 Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."
07資 8:24 Then Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you; each of you give me an earring he has taken as booty." (For the enemy had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
07資 8:25 "We will willingly give them," they answered. So they spread a garment, and each threw into it an earring he had taken as booty.
07資 8:26 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold (apart from the crescents and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and the collars that were on the necks of their camels).
07資 8:27 Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his town, in Ophrah; and all Israel prostituted themselves to it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
07資 8:28 So Midian was subdued before the Israelites, and they lifted up their heads no more. So the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
07資 8:29 Jerubbaal son of Joash went to live in his own house.
07資 8:30 Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
07資 8:31 His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
07資 8:32 Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07資 8:33 As soon as Gideon died, the Israelites relapsed and prostituted themselves with the Baals, making Baal-berith their god.
07資 8:34 The Israelites did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies on every side;
07資 8:35 and they did not exhibit loyalty to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.
07資 9:1 Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's kinsfolk and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family,
07資 9:2 "Say in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
07資 9:3 So his mother's kinsfolk spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
07資 9:4 They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the temple of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
07資 9:5 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone; but Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself.
07資 9:6 Then all the lords of Shechem and all Beth-millo came together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
07資 9:7 When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and cried aloud and said to them, "Listen to me, you lords of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.
07資 9:8 The trees once went out to anoint a king over themselves. So they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
07資 9:9 The olive tree answered them, 'Shall I stop producing my rich oil by which gods and mortals are honored, and go to sway over the trees?'
07資 9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and reign over us.'
07資 9:11 But the fig tree answered them, 'Shall I stop producing my sweetness and my delicious fruit, and go to sway over the trees?'
07資 9:12 Then the trees said to the vine, 'You come and reign over us.'
07資 9:13 But the vine said to them, 'Shall I stop producing my wine that cheers gods and mortals, and go to sway over the trees?'
07資 9:14 So all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come and reign over us.'
07資 9:15 And the bramble said to the trees, 'If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'
07資 9:16 "Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and honor when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as his actions deserved--
07資 9:17 for my father fought for you, and risked his life, and rescued you from the hand of Midian;
07資 9:18 but you have risen up against my father's house this day, and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your kinsman--
07資 9:19 if, I say, you have acted in good faith and honor with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;
07資 9:20 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the lords of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the lords of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech."
07資 9:21 Then Jotham ran away and fled, going to Beer, where he remained for fear of his brother Abimelech.
07資 9:22 Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
07資 9:23 But God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem; and the lords of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech.
07資 9:24 This happened so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged and their blood be laid on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the lords of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
07資 9:25 So, out of hostility to him, the lords of Shechem set ambushes on the mountain tops. They robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was reported to Abimelech.
07資 9:26 When Gaal son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his kinsfolk, the lords of Shechem put confidence in him.
07資 9:27 They went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and celebrated. Then they went into the temple of their god, ate and drank, and ridiculed Abimelech.
07資 9:28 Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Did not the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him?
07資 9:29 If only this people were under my command! Then I would remove Abimelech; I would say to him, 'Increase your army, and come out.'"
07資 9:30 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
07資 9:31 He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah, saying, "Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his kinsfolk have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.
07資 9:32 Now therefore, go by night, you and the troops that are with you, and lie in wait in the fields.
07資 9:33 Then early in the morning, as soon as the sun rises, get up and rush on the city; and when he and the troops that are with him come out against you, you may deal with them as best you can."
07資 9:34 So Abimelech and all the troops with him got up by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
07資 9:35 When Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, Abimelech and the troops with him rose from the ambush.
07資 9:36 And when Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountain tops!" And Zebul said to him, "The shadows on the mountains look like people to you."
07資 9:37 Gaal spoke again and said, "Look, people are coming down from Tabbur-erez, and one company is coming from the direction of Elon-meonenim."
07資 9:38 Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your boast now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Are not these the troops you made light of? Go out now and fight with them."
07資 9:39 So Gaal went out at the head of the lords of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
07資 9:40 Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. Many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.
07資 9:41 So Abimelech resided at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his kinsfolk, so that they could not live on at Shechem.
07資 9:42 On the following day the people went out into the fields. When Abimelech was told,
07資 9:43 he took his troops and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the fields. When he looked and saw the people coming out of the city, he rose against them and killed them.
07資 9:44 Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed on all who were in the fields and killed them.
07資 9:45 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city, and killed the people that were in it; and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
07資 9:46 When all the lords of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the temple of El-berith.
07資 9:47 Abimelech was told that all the lords of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
07資 9:48 So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the troops that were with him. Abimelech took an ax in his hand, cut down a bundle of brushwood, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the troops with him, "What you have seen me do, do quickly, as I have done."
07資 9:49 So every one of the troops cut down a bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
07資 9:50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
07資 9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the lords of the city fled to it and shut themselves in; and they went to the roof of the tower.
07資 9:52 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.
07資 9:53 But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull.
07資 9:54 Immediately he called to the young man who carried his armor and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, so people will not say about me, 'A woman killed him.'" So the young man thrust him through, and he died.
07資 9:55 When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
07資 9:56 Thus God repaid Abimelech for the crime he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers;
07資 9:57 and God also made all the wickedness of the people of Shechem fall back on their heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal.
07資 10:1 After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, who lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim, rose to deliver Israel.
07資 10:2 He judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died, and was buried at Shamir.
07資 10:3 After him came Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
07資 10:4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; and they had thirty towns, which are in the land of Gilead, and are called Havvoth-jair to this day.
07資 10:5 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
07資 10:6 The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, worshiping the Baals and the Astartes, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. Thus they abandoned the LORD, and did not worship him.
07資 10:7 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
07資 10:8 and they crushed and oppressed the Israelites that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
07資 10:9 The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.
07資 10:10 So the Israelites cried to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against you, because we have abandoned our God and have worshiped the Baals."
07資 10:11 And the LORD said to the Israelites, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines?
07資 10:12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
07資 10:13 Yet you have abandoned me and worshiped other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more.
07資 10:14 Go and cry to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress."
07資 10:15 And the Israelites said to the LORD, "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you; but deliver us this day!"
07資 10:16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them and worshiped the LORD; and he could no longer bear to see Israel suffer.
07資 10:17 Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead; and the Israelites came together, and they encamped at Mizpah.
07資 10:18 The commanders of the people of Gilead said to one another, "Who will begin the fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07資 11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite, the son of a prostitute, was a mighty warrior. Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
07資 11:2 Gilead's wife also bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away, saying to him, "You shall not inherit anything in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."
07資 11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws collected around Jephthah and went raiding with him.
07資 11:4 After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.
07資 11:5 And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.
07資 11:6 They said to Jephthah, "Come and be our commander, so that we may fight with the Ammonites."
07資 11:7 But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Are you not the very ones who rejected me and drove me out of my father's house? So why do you come to me now when you are in trouble?"
07資 11:8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "Nevertheless, we have now turned back to you, so that you may go with us and fight with the Ammonites, and become head over us, over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07資 11:9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight with the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them over to me, I will be your head."
07資 11:10 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD will be witness between us; we will surely do as you say."
07資 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.
07資 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, "What is there between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
07資 11:13 The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel, on coming from Egypt, took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably."
07資 11:14 Once again Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
07資 11:15 and said to him: "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
07資 11:16 but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
07資 11:17 Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Let us pass through your land'; but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
07資 11:18 Then they journeyed through the wilderness, went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, arrived on the east side of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
07資 11:19 Israel then sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, 'Let us pass through your land to our country.'
07資 11:20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
07資 11:21 Then the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel occupied all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.
07資 11:22 They occupied all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
07資 11:23 So now the LORD, the God of Israel, has conquered the Amorites for the benefit of his people Israel. Do you intend to take their place?
07資 11:24 Should you not possess what your god Chemosh gives you to possess? And should we not be the ones to possess everything that the LORD our God has conquered for our benefit?
07資 11:25 Now are you any better than King Balak son of Zippor of Moab? Did he ever enter into conflict with Israel, or did he ever go to war with them?
07資 11:26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the towns that are along the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?
07資 11:27 It is not I who have sinned against you, but you are the one who does me wrong by making war on me. Let the LORD, who is judge, decide today for the Israelites or for the Ammonites."
07資 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites did not heed the message that Jephthah sent him.
07資 11:29 Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh. He passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.
07資 11:30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, and said, "If you will give the Ammonites into my hand,
07資 11:31 then whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the LORD's, to be offered up by me as a burnt offering."
07資 11:32 So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand.
07資 11:33 He inflicted a massive defeat on them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty towns, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.
07資 11:34 Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah; and there was his daughter coming out to meet him with timbrels and with dancing. She was his only child; he had no son or daughter except her.
07資 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low; you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot take back my vow."
07資 11:36 She said to him, "My father, if you have opened your mouth to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the LORD has given you vengeance against your enemies, the Ammonites."
07資 11:37 And she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: Grant me two months, so that I may go and wander on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, my companions and I."
07資 11:38 "Go," he said and sent her away for two months. So she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
07資 11:39 At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to the vow he had made. She had never slept with a man. So there arose an Israelite custom that
07資 11:40 for four days every year the daughters of Israel would go out to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
07資 12:1 The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down over you!"
07資 12:2 Jephthah said to them, "My people and I were engaged in conflict with the Ammonites who oppressed us severely. But when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand.
07資 12:3 When I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hand, and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day, to fight against me?"
07資 12:4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives from Ephraim, you Gileadites--in the heart of Ephraim and Manasseh."
07資 12:5 Then the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he said, "No,"
07資 12:6 they said to him, "Then say Shibboleth," and he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites fell at that time.
07資 12:7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in his town in Gilead.
07資 12:8 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
07資 12:9 He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters in marriage outside his clan and brought in thirty young women from outside for his sons. He judged Israel seven years.
07資 12:10 Then Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
07資 12:11 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
07資 12:12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07資 12:13 After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
07資 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys; he judged Israel eight years.
07資 12:15 Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07資 13:1 The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
07資 13:2 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren, having borne no children.
07資 13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Although you are barren, having borne no children, you shall conceive and bear a son.
07資 13:4 Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or to eat anything unclean,
07資 13:5 for you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor is to come on his head, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth. It is he who shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines."
07資 13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, most awe-inspiring; I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name;
07資 13:7 but he said to me, 'You shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.'"
07資 13:8 Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, "O, LORD, I pray, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born."
07資 13:9 God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
07資 13:10 So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."
07資 13:11 Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the man and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to this woman?" And he said, "I am."
07資 13:12 Then Manoah said, "Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy's rule of life; what is he to do?"
07資 13:13 The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Let the woman give heed to all that I said to her.
07資 13:14 She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine. She is not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She is to observe everything that I commanded her."
07資 13:15 Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Allow us to detain you, and prepare a kid for you."
07資 13:16 The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "If you detain me, I will not eat your food; but if you want to prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD." (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)
07資 13:17 Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that we may honor you when your words come true?"
07資 13:18 But the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful."
07資 13:19 So Manoah took the kid with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to him who works wonders.
07資 13:20 When the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar while Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
07資 13:21 The angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah realized that it was the angel of the LORD.
07資 13:22 And Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God."
07資 13:23 But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these."
07資 13:24 The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.
07資 13:25 The spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07資 14:1 Once Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw a Philistine woman.
07資 14:2 Then he came up, and told his father and mother, "I saw a Philistine woman at Timnah; now get her for me as my wife."
07資 14:3 But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among your kin, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, because she pleases me."
07資 14:4 His father and mother did not know that this was from the LORD; for he was seeking a pretext to act against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
07資 14:5 Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When he came to the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion roared at him.
07資 14:6 The spirit of the LORD rushed on him, and he tore the lion apart barehanded as one might tear apart a kid. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
07資 14:7 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson.
07資 14:8 After a while he returned to marry her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
07資 14:9 He scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion.
07資 14:10 His father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there as the young men were accustomed to do.
07資 14:11 When the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
07資 14:12 Samson said to them, "Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.
07資 14:13 But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments." So they said to him, "Ask your riddle; let us hear it."
07資 14:14 He said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet." But for three days they could not explain the riddle.
07資 14:15 On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Coax your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?"
07資 14:16 So Samson's wife wept before him, saying, "You hate me; you do not really love me. You have asked a riddle of my people, but you have not explained it to me." He said to her, "Look, I have not told my father or my mother. Why should I tell you?"
07資 14:17 She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted; and because she nagged him, on the seventh day he told her. Then she explained the riddle to her people.
07資 14:18 The men of the town said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."
07資 14:19 Then the spirit of the LORD rushed on him, and he went down to Ashkelon. He killed thirty men of the town, took their spoil, and gave the festal garments to those who had explained the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house.
07資 14:20 And Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.
07資 15:1 After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing along a kid. He said, "I want to go into my wife's room." But her father would not allow him to go in.
07資 15:2 Her father said, "I was sure that you had rejected her; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister prettier than she? Why not take her instead?"
07資 15:3 Samson said to them, "This time, when I do mischief to the Philistines, I will be without blame."
07資 15:4 So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took some torches; and he turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails.
07資 15:5 When he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
07資 15:6 Then the Philistines asked, "Who has done this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken Samson's wife and given her to his companion." So the Philistines came up, and burned her and her father.
07資 15:7 Samson said to them, "If this is what you do, I swear I will not stop until I have taken revenge on you."
07資 15:8 He struck them down hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
07資 15:9 Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and made a raid on Lehi.
07資 15:10 The men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us."
07資 15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and they said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then have you done to us?" He replied, "As they did to me, so I have done to them."
07資 15:12 They said to him, "We have come down to bind you, so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." Samson answered them, "Swear to me that you yourselves will not attack me."
07資 15:13 They said to him, "No, we will only bind you and give you into their hands; we will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
07資 15:14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the spirit of the LORD rushed on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.
07資 15:15 Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached down and took it, and with it he killed a thousand men.
07資 15:16 And Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men."
07資 15:17 When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
07資 15:18 By then he was very thirsty, and he called on the LORD, saying, "You have granted this great victory by the hand of your servant. Am I now to die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
07資 15:19 So God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came from it. When he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore it was named En-hakkore, which is at Lehi to this day.
07資 15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
07資 16:1 Once Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went in to her.
07資 16:2 The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here." So they circled around and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, thinking, "Let us wait until the light of the morning; then we will kill him."
07資 16:3 But Samson lay only until midnight. Then at midnight he rose up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.
07資 16:4 After this he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
07資 16:5 The lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her, "Coax him, and find out what makes his strength so great, and how we may overpower him, so that we may bind him in order to subdue him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
07資 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me what makes your strength so great, and how you could be bound, so that one could subdue you."
07資 16:7 Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried out, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else."
07資 16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not dried out, and she bound him with them.
07資 16:9 While men were lying in wait in an inner chamber, she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings, as a strand of fiber snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
07資 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have mocked me and told me lies; please tell me how you could be bound."
07資 16:11 He said to her, "If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else."
07資 16:12 So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" (The men lying in wait were in an inner chamber.) But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
07資 16:13 Then Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me how you could be bound." He said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else."
07資 16:14 So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web, and made them tight with the pin. Then she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.
07資 16:15 Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me three times now and have not told me what makes your strength so great."
07資 16:16 Finally, after she had nagged him with her words day after day, and pestered him, he was tired to death.
07資 16:17 So he told her his whole secret, and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head; for I have been a nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, then my strength would leave me; I would become weak, and be like anyone else."
07資 16:18 When Delilah realized that he had told her his whole secret, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "This time come up, for he has told his whole secret to me." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hands.
07資 16:19 She let him fall asleep on her lap; and she called a man, and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. He began to weaken, and his strength left him.
07資 16:20 Then she said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" When he awoke from his sleep, he thought, "I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
07資 16:21 So the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
07資 16:22 But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
07資 16:23 Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to rejoice; for they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand."
07資 16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us."
07資 16:25 And when their hearts were merry, they said, "Call Samson, and let him entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. They made him stand between the pillars;
07資 16:26 and Samson said to the attendant who held him by the hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, so that I may lean against them."
07資 16:27 Now the house was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson performed.
07資 16:28 Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "Lord GOD, remember me and strengthen me only this once, O God, so that with this one act of revenge I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes."
07資 16:29 And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.
07資 16:30 Then Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." He strained with all his might; and the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So those he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life.
07資 16:31 Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years.
07資 17:1 There was a man in the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
07資 17:2 He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and even spoke it in my hearing,--that silver is in my possession; I took it; but now I will return it to you." And his mother said, "May my son be blessed by the LORD!"
07資 17:3 Then he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, "I consecrate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make an idol of cast metal."
07資 17:4 So when he returned the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into an idol of cast metal; and it was in the house of Micah.
07資 17:5 This man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and teraphim, and installed one of his sons, who became his priest.
07資 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes.
07資 17:7 Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the clan of Judah. He was a Levite residing there.
07資 17:8 This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to live wherever he could find a place. He came to the house of Micah in the hill country of Ephraim to carry on his work.
07資 17:9 Micah said to him, "From where do you come?" He replied, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to live wherever I can find a place."
07資 17:10 Then Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your living."
07資 17:11 The Levite agreed to stay with the man; and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
07資 17:12 So Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
07資 17:13 Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because the Levite has become my priest."
07資 18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself a territory to live in; for until then no territory among the tribes of Israel had been allotted to them.
07資 18:2 So the Danites sent five valiant men from the whole number of their clan, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, "Go, explore the land." When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they stayed there.
07資 18:3 While they were at Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?"
07資 18:4 He said to them, "Micah did such and such for me, and he hired me, and I have become his priest."
07資 18:5 Then they said to him, "Inquire of God that we may know whether the mission we are undertaking will succeed."
07資 18:6 The priest replied, "Go in peace. The mission you are on is under the eye of the LORD."
07資 18:7 The five men went on, and when they came to Laish, they observed the people who were there living securely, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing on earth, and possessing wealth. Furthermore, they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with Aram.
07資 18:8 When they came to their kinsfolk at Zorah and Eshtaol, they said to them, "What do you report?"
07資 18:9 They said, "Come, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, but enter in and possess the land.
07資 18:10 When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad--God has indeed given it into your hands--a place where there is no lack of anything on earth."
07資 18:11 Six hundred men of the Danite clan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,
07資 18:12 and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
07資 18:13 From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
07資 18:14 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land (that is, Laish) said to their comrades, "Do you know that in these buildings there are an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? Now therefore consider what you will do."
07資 18:15 So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and greeted him.
07資 18:16 While the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate,
07資 18:17 the five men who had gone to spy out the land proceeded to enter and take the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim. The priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
07資 18:18 When the men went into Micah's house and took the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
07資 18:19 They said to him, "Keep quiet! Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one person, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?"
07資 18:20 Then the priest accepted the offer. He took the ephod, the teraphim, and the idol, and went along with the people.
07資 18:21 So they resumed their journey, putting the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them.
07資 18:22 When they were some distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the Danites.
07資 18:23 They shouted to the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter that you come with such a company?"
07資 18:24 He replied, "You take my gods that I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then can you ask me, 'What is the matter?'"
07資 18:25 And the Danites said to him, "You had better not let your voice be heard among us or else hot-tempered fellows will attack you, and you will lose your life and the lives of your household."
07資 18:26 Then the Danites went their way. When Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
07資 18:27 The Danites, having taken what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, put them to the sword, and burned down the city.
07資 18:28 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with Aram. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city, and lived in it.
07資 18:29 They named the city Dan, after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was formerly Laish.
07資 18:30 Then the Danites set up the idol for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the time the land went into captivity.
07資 18:31 So they maintained as their own Micah's idol that he had made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
07資 19:1 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite, residing in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
07資 19:2 But his concubine became angry with him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.
07資 19:3 Then her husband set out after her, to speak tenderly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. When he reached her father's house, the girl's father saw him and came with joy to meet him.
07資 19:4 His father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days; so they ate and drank, and he stayed there.
07資 19:5 On the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Fortify yourself with a bit of food, and after that you may go."
07資 19:6 So the two men sat and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, "Why not spend the night and enjoy yourself?"
07資 19:7 When the man got up to go, his father-in-law kept urging him until he spent the night there again.
07資 19:8 On the fifth day he got up early in the morning to leave; and the girl's father said, "Fortify yourself." So they lingered until the day declined, and the two of them ate and drank.
07資 19:9 When the man with his concubine and his servant got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Look, the day has worn on until it is almost evening. Spend the night. See, the day has drawn to a close. Spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early in the morning for your journey, and go home."
07資 19:10 But the man would not spend the night; he got up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.
07資 19:11 When they were near Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, and spend the night in it."
07資 19:12 But his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel; but we will continue on to Gibeah."
07資 19:13 Then he said to his servant, "Come, let us try to reach one of these places, and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah."
07資 19:14 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
07資 19:15 They turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. He went in and sat down in the open square of the city, but no one took them in to spend the night.
07資 19:16 Then at evening there was an old man coming from his work in the field. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was residing in Gibeah. (The people of the place were Benjaminites.)
07資 19:17 When the old man looked up and saw the wayfarer in the open square of the city, he said, "Where are you going and where do you come from?"
07資 19:18 He answered him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; and I am going to my home. Nobody has offered to take me in.
07資 19:19 We your servants have straw and fodder for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and the woman and the young man along with us. We need nothing more."
07資 19:20 The old man said, "Peace be to you. I will care for all your wants; only do not spend the night in the square."
07資 19:21 So he brought him into his house, and fed the donkeys; they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
07資 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, the men of the city, a perverse lot, surrounded the house, and started pounding on the door. They said to the old man, the master of the house, "Bring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have intercourse with him."
07資 19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Since this man is my guest, do not do this vile thing.
07資 19:24 Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do whatever you want to them; but against this man do not do such a vile thing."
07資 19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine, and put her out to them. They wantonly raped her, and abused her all through the night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go.
07資 19:26 As morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.
07資 19:27 In the morning her master got up, opened the doors of the house, and when he went out to go on his way, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
07資 19:28 "Get up," he said to her, "we are going." But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey; and the man set out for his home.
07資 19:29 When he had entered his house, he took a knife, and grasping his concubine he cut her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
07資 19:30 Then he commanded the men whom he sent, saying, "Thus shall you say to all the Israelites, 'Has such a thing ever happened since the day that the Israelites came up from the land of Egypt until this day? Consider it, take counsel, and speak out.' "
07資 20:1 Then all the Israelites came out, from Dan to Beer-sheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled in one body before the LORD at Mizpah.
07資 20:2 The chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot-soldiers bearing arms.
07資 20:3 (Now the Benjaminites heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites said, "Tell us, how did this criminal act come about?"
07資 20:4 The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, "I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.
07資 20:5 The lords of Gibeah rose up against me, and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine until she died.
07資 20:6 Then I took my concubine and cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the whole extent of Israel's territory; for they have committed a vile outrage in Israel.
07資 20:7 So now, you Israelites, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."
07資 20:8 All the people got up as one, saying, "We will not any of us go to our tents, nor will any of us return to our houses.
07資 20:9 But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot.
07資 20:10 We will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the troops, who are going to repay Gibeah of Benjamin for all the disgrace that they have done in Israel."
07資 20:11 So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one.
07資 20:12 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What crime is this that has been committed among you?
07資 20:13 Now then, hand over those scoundrels in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death, and purge the evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites would not listen to their kinsfolk, the Israelites.
07資 20:14 The Benjaminites came together out of the towns to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the Israelites.
07資 20:15 On that day the Benjaminites mustered twenty-six thousand armed men from their towns, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah.
07資 20:16 Of all this force, there were seven hundred picked men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair, and not miss.
07資 20:17 And the Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand armed men, all of them warriors.
07資 20:18 The Israelites proceeded to go up to Bethel, where they inquired of God, "Which of us shall go up first to battle against the Benjaminites?" And the LORD answered, "Judah shall go up first."
07資 20:19 Then the Israelites got up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
07資 20:20 The Israelites went out to battle against Benjamin; and the Israelites drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah.
07資 20:21 The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah, and struck down on that day twenty-two thousand of the Israelites.
07資 20:22 The Israelites took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day.
07資 20:23 The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until the evening; and they inquired of the LORD, "Shall we again draw near to battle against our kinsfolk the Benjaminites?" And the LORD said, "Go up against them."
07資 20:24 So the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites the second day.
07資 20:25 Benjamin moved out against them from Gibeah the second day, and struck down eighteen thousand of the Israelites, all of them armed men.
07資 20:26 Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went back to Bethel and wept, sitting there before the LORD; they fasted that day until evening. Then they offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being before the LORD.
07資 20:27 And the Israelites inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
07資 20:28 and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, "Shall we go out once more to battle against our kinsfolk the Benjaminites, or shall we desist?" The LORD answered, "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand."
07資 20:29 So Israel stationed men in ambush around Gibeah.
07資 20:30 Then the Israelites went up against the Benjaminites on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as before.
07資 20:31 When the Benjaminites went out against the army, they were drawn away from the city. As before they began to inflict casualties on the troops, along the main roads, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, as well as in the open country, killing about thirty men of Israel.
07資 20:32 The Benjaminites thought, "They are being routed before us, as previously." But the Israelites said, "Let us retreat and draw them away from the city toward the roads."
07資 20:33 The main body of the Israelites drew back its battle line to Baal-tamar, while those Israelites who were in ambush rushed out of their place west of Geba.
07資 20:34 There came against Gibeah ten thousand picked men out of all Israel, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was close upon them.
07資 20:35 The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel; and the Israelites destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin that day, all of them armed.
07資 20:36 Then the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated. The Israelites gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted to the troops in ambush that they had stationed against Gibeah.
07資 20:37 The troops in ambush rushed quickly upon Gibeah. Then they put the whole city to the sword.
07資 20:38 Now the agreement between the main body of Israel and the men in ambush was that when they sent up a cloud of smoke out of the city
07資 20:39 the main body of Israel should turn in battle. But Benjamin had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites, killing about thirty of them; so they thought, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
07資 20:40 But when the cloud, a column of smoke, began to rise out of the city, the Benjaminites looked behind them--and there was the whole city going up in smoke toward the sky!
07資 20:41 Then the main body of Israel turned, and the Benjaminites were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them.
07資 20:42 Therefore they turned away from the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the city were slaughtering them in between.
07資 20:43 Cutting down the Benjaminites, they pursued them from Nohah and trod them down as far as a place east of Gibeah.
07資 20:44 Eighteen thousand Benjaminites fell, all of them courageous fighters.
07資 20:45 When they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, five thousand of them were cut down on the main roads, and they were pursued as far as Gidom, and two thousand of them were slain.
07資 20:46 So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand arms-bearing men, all of them courageous fighters.
07資 20:47 But six hundred turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.
07資 20:48 Meanwhile, the Israelites turned back against the Benjaminites, and put them to the sword--the city, the people, the animals, and all that remained. Also the remaining towns they set on fire.
07資 21:1 Now the Israelites had sworn at Mizpah, "No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin."
07資 21:2 And the people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
07資 21:3 They said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, why has it come to pass that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?"
07資 21:4 On the next day, the people got up early, and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being.
07資 21:5 Then the Israelites said, "Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For a solemn oath had been taken concerning whoever did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, "That one shall be put to death."
07資 21:6 But the Israelites had compassion for Benjamin their kin, and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.
07資 21:7 What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters as wives?"
07資 21:8 Then they said, "Is there anyone from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah?" It turned out that no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp, to the assembly.
07資 21:9 For when the roll was called among the people, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.
07資 21:10 So the congregation sent twelve thousand soldiers there and commanded them, "Go, put the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead to the sword, including the women and the little ones.
07資 21:11 This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction."
07資 21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man and brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
07資 21:13 Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
07資 21:14 Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; but they did not suffice for them.
07資 21:15 The people had compassion on Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
07資 21:16 So the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since there are no women left in Benjamin?"
07資 21:17 And they said, "There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, in order that a tribe may not be blotted out from Israel.
07資 21:18 Yet we cannot give any of our daughters to them as wives." For the Israelites had sworn, "Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin."
07資 21:19 So they said, "Look, the yearly festival of the LORD is taking place at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
07資 21:20 And they instructed the Benjaminites, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
07資 21:21 and watch; when the young women of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and each of you carry off a wife for himself from the young women of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
07資 21:22 Then if their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, 'Be generous and allow us to have them; because we did not capture in battle a wife for each man. But neither did you incur guilt by giving your daughters to them.'"
07資 21:23 The Benjaminites did so; they took wives for each of them from the dancers whom they abducted. Then they went and returned to their territory, and rebuilt the towns, and lived in them.
07資 21:24 So the Israelites departed from there at that time by tribes and families, and they went out from there to their own territories.
07資 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes.

08訣 1:1 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and two sons.
08訣 1:2 The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.
08訣 1:3 But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.
08訣 1:4 These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years,
08訣 1:5 both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
08訣 1:6 Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had considered his people and given them food.
08訣 1:7 So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah.
08訣 1:8 But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back each of you to your mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
08訣 1:9 The LORD grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your husband." Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud.
08訣 1:10 They said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people."
08訣 1:11 But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?
08訣 1:12 Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight and bear sons,
08訣 1:13 would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the LORD has turned against me."
08訣 1:14 Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
08訣 1:15 So she said, "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
08訣 1:16 But Ruth said, "Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you! Where you go, I will go; Where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.
08訣 1:17 Where you die, I will die--there will I be buried. May the LORD do thus and so to me, and more as well, if even death parts me from you!"
08訣 1:18 When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.
08訣 1:19 So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said, "Is this Naomi?"
08訣 1:20 She said to them, "Call me no longer Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me.
08訣 1:21 I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty; why call me Naomi when the LORD has dealt harshly with me, and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?"
08訣 1:22 So Naomi returned together with Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, who came back with her from the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
08訣 2:1 Now Naomi had a kinsman on her husband's side, a prominent rich man, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.
08訣 2:2 And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain, behind someone in whose sight I may find favor." She said to her, "Go, my daughter."
08訣 2:3 So she went. She came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers. As it happened, she came to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
08訣 2:4 Just then Boaz came from Bethlehem. He said to the reapers, "The LORD be with you." They answered, "The LORD bless you."
08訣 2:5 Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "To whom does this young woman belong?"
08訣 2:6 The servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "She is the Moabite who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.
08訣 2:7 She said, 'Please, let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the reapers.' So she came, and she has been on her feet from early this morning until now, without resting even for a moment."
08訣 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Now listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.
08訣 2:9 Keep your eyes on the field that is being reaped, and follow behind them. I have ordered the young men not to bother you. If you get thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn."
08訣 2:10 Then she fell prostrate, with her face to the ground, and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take notice of me, when I am a foreigner?"
08訣 2:11 But Boaz answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.
08訣 2:12 May the LORD reward you for your deeds, and may you have a full reward from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge!"
08訣 2:13 Then she said, "May I continue to find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, even though I am not one of your servants."
08訣 2:14 At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here, and eat some of this bread, and dip your morsel in the sour wine." So she sat beside the reapers, and he heaped up for her some parched grain. She ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.
08訣 2:15 When she got up to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, "Let her glean even among the standing sheaves, and do not reproach her.
08訣 2:16 You must also pull out some handfuls for her from the bundles, and leave them for her to glean, and do not rebuke her."
08訣 2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
08訣 2:18 She picked it up and came into the town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gleaned. Then she took out and gave her what was left over after she herself had been satisfied.
08訣 2:19 Her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."
08訣 2:20 Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "Blessed be he by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!" Naomi also said to her, "The man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin."
08訣 2:21 Then Ruth the Moabite said, "He even said to me, 'Stay close by my servants, until they have finished all my harvest.'"
08訣 2:22 Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, "It is better, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, otherwise you might be bothered in another field."
08訣 2:23 So she stayed close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
08訣 3:1 Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you.
08訣 3:2 Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
08訣 3:3 Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
08訣 3:4 When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do."
08訣 3:5 She said to her, "All that you tell me I will do."
08訣 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her.
08訣 3:7 When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in a contented mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came stealthily and uncovered his feet, and lay down.
08訣 3:8 At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and there, lying at his feet, was a woman!
08訣 3:9 He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your servant; spread your cloak over your servant, for you are next-of-kin."
08訣 3:10 He said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter; this last instance of your loyalty is better than the first; you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.
08訣 3:11 And now, my daughter, do not be afraid, I will do for you all that you ask, for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman.
08訣 3:12 But now, though it is true that I am a near kinsman, there is another kinsman more closely related than I.
08訣 3:13 Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will act as next-of-kin for you, good; let him do it. If he is not willing to act as next-of-kin for you, then, as the LORD lives, I will act as next-of-kin for you. Lie down until the morning."
08訣 3:14 So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could recognize another; for he said, "It must not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
08訣 3:15 Then he said, "Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out." So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and put it on her back; then he went into the city.
08訣 3:16 She came to her mother-in-law, who said, "How did things go with you, my daughter?" Then she told her all that the man had done for her,
08訣 3:17 saying, "He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, 'Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
08訣 3:18 She replied, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today."
08訣 4:1 No sooner had Boaz gone up to the gate and sat down there than the next-of-kin, of whom Boaz had spoken, came passing by. So Boaz said, "Come over, friend; sit down here." And he went over and sat down.
08訣 4:2 Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down here"; so they sat down.
08訣 4:3 He then said to the next-of-kin, "Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our kinsman Elimelech.
08訣 4:4 So I thought I would tell you of it, and say: Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, so that I may know; for there is no one prior to you to redeem it, and I come after you." So he said, "I will redeem it."
08訣 4:5 Then Boaz said, "The day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you are also acquiring Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead man, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance."
08訣 4:6 At this, the next-of-kin said, "I cannot redeem it for myself without damaging my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it."
08訣 4:7 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one took off a sandal and gave it to the other; this was the manner of attesting in Israel.
08訣 4:8 So when the next-of-kin said to Boaz, "Acquire it for yourself," he took off his sandal.
08訣 4:9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have acquired from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.
08訣 4:10 I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance, in order that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native place; today you are witnesses."
08訣 4:11 Then all the people who were at the gate, along with the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you produce children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem;
08訣 4:12 and, through the children that the LORD will give you by this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."
08訣 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When they came together, the LORD made her conceive, and she bore a son.
08訣 4:14 Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without next-of-kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel!
08訣 4:15 He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him."
08訣 4:16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse.
08訣 4:17 The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." They named him Obed; he became the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08訣 4:18 Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,
08訣 4:19 Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab,
08訣 4:20 Amminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,
08訣 4:21 Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed,
08訣 4:22 Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David.
09
09誌雌 1:1 There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
09誌雌 1:2 He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
09誌雌 1:3 Now this man used to go up year by year from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.
09誌雌 1:4 On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;
09誌雌 1:5 but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.
09誌雌 1:6 Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
09誌雌 1:7 So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
09誌雌 1:8 Her husband Elkanah said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"
09誌雌 1:9 After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the LORD. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
09誌雌 1:10 She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.
09誌雌 1:11 She made this vow: "O LORD of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head."
09誌雌 1:12 As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
09誌雌 1:13 Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk.
09誌雌 1:14 So Eli said to her, "How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine."
09誌雌 1:15 But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
09誌雌 1:16 Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time."
09誌雌 1:17 Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him."
09誌雌 1:18 And she said, "Let your servant find favor in your sight." Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.
09誌雌 1:19 They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.
09誌雌 1:20 In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, "I have asked him of the LORD."
09誌雌 1:21 The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.
09誌雌 1:22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the LORD, and remain there forever; I will offer him as a nazirite for all time."
09誌雌 1:23 Her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only--may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
09誌雌 1:24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh; and the child was young.
09誌雌 1:25 Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
09誌雌 1:26 And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.
09誌雌 1:27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD has granted me the petition that I made to him.
09誌雌 1:28 Therefore I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is given to the LORD." She left him there for the LORD.
09誌雌 2:1 Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in my God. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in my victory.
09誌雌 2:2 "There is no Holy One like the LORD, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.
09誌雌 2:3 Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
09誌雌 2:4 The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.
09誌雌 2:5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.
09誌雌 2:6 The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
09誌雌 2:7 The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.
09誌雌 2:8 He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world.
09誌雌 2:9 "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail.
09誌雌 2:10 The LORD! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed."
09誌雌 2:11 Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, while the boy remained to minister to the LORD, in the presence of the priest Eli.
09誌雌 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they had no regard for the LORD
09誌雌 2:13 or for the duties of the priests to the people. When anyone offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,
09誌雌 2:14 and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
09誌雌 2:15 Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
09誌雌 2:16 And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then take whatever you wish," he would say, "No, you must give it now; if not, I will take it by force."
09誌雌 2:17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD; for they treated the offerings of the LORD with contempt.
09誌雌 2:18 Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy wearing a linen ephod.
09誌雌 2:19 His mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
09誌雌 2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, "May the LORD repay you with children by this woman for the gift that she made to the LORD"; and then they would return to their home.
09誌雌 2:21 And the LORD took note of Hannah; she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
09誌雌 2:22 Now Eli was very old. He heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
09誌雌 2:23 He said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.
09誌雌 2:24 No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.
09誌雌 2:25 If one person sins against another, someone can intercede for the sinner with the LORD; but if someone sins against the LORD, who can make intercession?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the LORD to kill them.
09誌雌 2:26 Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and with the people.
09誌雌 2:27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Thus the LORD has said, 'I revealed myself to the family of your ancestor in Egypt when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh.
09誌雌 2:28 I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to offer incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the family of your ancestor all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.
09誌雌 2:29 Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'
09誌雌 2:30 Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: 'I promised that your family and the family of your ancestor should go in and out before me forever'; but now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be treated with contempt.
09誌雌 2:31 See, a time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your ancestor's family, so that no one in your family will live to old age.
09誌雌 2:32 Then in distress you will look with greedy eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed upon Israel; and no one in your family shall ever live to old age.
09誌雌 2:33 The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; all the members of your household shall die by the sword.
09誌雌 2:34 The fate of your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you--both of them shall die on the same day.
09誌雌 2:35 I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed one forever.
09誌雌 2:36 Everyone who is left in your family shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me in one of the priest's places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'"
09誌雌 3:1 Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. The word of the LORD was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.
09誌雌 3:2 At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his room;
09誌雌 3:3 the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.
09誌雌 3:4 Then the LORD called, "Samuel! Samuel!" and he said, "Here I am!"
09誌雌 3:5 and ran to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call; lie down again." So he went and lay down.
09誌雌 3:6 The LORD called again, "Samuel!" Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."
09誌雌 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
09誌雌 3:8 The LORD called Samuel again, a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.
09誌雌 3:9 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
09誌雌 3:10 Now the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."
09誌雌 3:11 Then the LORD said to Samuel, "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears of it tingle.
09誌雌 3:12 On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
09誌雌 3:13 For I have told him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.
09誌雌 3:14 Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering forever."
09誌雌 3:15 Samuel lay there until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
09誌雌 3:16 But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." He said, "Here I am."
09誌雌 3:17 Eli said, "What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you."
09誌雌 3:18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. Then he said, "It is the LORD; let him do what seems good to him."
09誌雌 3:19 As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
09誌雌 3:20 And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the LORD.
09誌雌 3:21 The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
09誌雌 4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. In those days the Philistines mustered for war against Israel, and Israel went out to battle against them; they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.
09誌雌 4:2 The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle was joined, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.
09誌雌 4:3 When the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, so that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies."
09誌雌 4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
09誌雌 4:5 When the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.
09誌雌 4:6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,
09誌雌 4:7 the Philistines were afraid; for they said, "Gods have come into the camp." They also said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
09誌雌 4:8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.
09誌雌 4:9 Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, in order not to become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight."
09誌雌 4:10 So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated, and they fled, everyone to his home. There was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
09誌雌 4:11 The ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
09誌雌 4:12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with earth upon his head.
09誌雌 4:13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.
09誌雌 4:14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, "What is this uproar?" Then the man came quickly and told Eli.
09誌雌 4:15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
09誌雌 4:16 The man said to Eli, "I have just come from the battle; I fled from the battle today." He said, "How did it go, my son?"
09誌雌 4:17 The messenger replied, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the troops; your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
09誌雌 4:18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
09誌雌 4:19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. When she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth; for her labor pains overwhelmed her.
09誌雌 4:20 As she was about to die, the women attending her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son." But she did not answer or give heed.
09誌雌 4:21 She named the child Ichabod, meaning, "The glory has departed from Israel," because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
09誌雌 4:22 She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
09誌雌 5:1 When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod;
09誌雌 5:2 then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.
09誌雌 5:3 When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
09誌雌 5:4 But when they rose early on the next morning, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
09誌雌 5:5 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
09誌雌 5:6 The hand of the LORD was heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and in its territory.
09誌雌 5:7 And when the inhabitants of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us; for his hand is heavy on us and on our god Dagon."
09誌雌 5:8 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" The inhabitants of Gath replied, "Let the ark of God be moved on to us." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.
09誌雌 5:9 But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic; he struck the inhabitants of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
09誌雌 5:10 So they sent the ark of the God of Israel to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "Why have they brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people?"
09誌雌 5:11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people." For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there;
09誌雌 5:12 those who did not die were stricken with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
09誌雌 6:1 The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
09誌雌 6:2 Then the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us what we should send with it to its place."
09誌雌 6:3 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and will be ransomed; will not his hand then turn from you?"
09誌雌 6:4 And they said, "What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?" They answered, "Five gold tumors and five gold mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for the same plague was upon all of you and upon your lords.
09誌雌 6:5 So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and your gods and your land.
09誌雌 6:6 Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had made fools of them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
09誌雌 6:7 Now then, get ready a new cart and two milch cows that have never borne a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.
09誌雌 6:8 Take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart, and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off, and let it go its way.
09誌雌 6:9 And watch; if it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance."
09誌雌 6:10 The men did so; they took two milch cows and yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
09誌雌 6:11 They put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the box with the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
09誌雌 6:12 The cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
09誌雌 6:13 Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they went with rejoicing to meet it.
09誌雌 6:14 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, and stopped there. A large stone was there; so they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
09誌雌 6:15 The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the gold objects, and set them upon the large stone. Then the people of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and presented sacrifices on that day to the LORD.
09誌雌 6:16 When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.
09誌雌 6:17 These are the gold tumors, which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;
09誌雌 6:18 also the gold mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone, beside which they set down the ark of the LORD, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
09誌雌 6:19 The descendants of Jeconiah did not rejoice with the people of Beth-shemesh when they greeted the ark of the LORD; and he killed seventy men of them. The people mourned because the LORD had made a great slaughter among the people.
09誌雌 6:20 Then the people of Beth-shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? To whom shall he go so that we may be rid of him?"
09誌雌 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you."
09誌雌 7:1 And the people of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD, and brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. They consecrated his son, Eleazar, to have charge of the ark of the LORD.
09誌雌 7:2 From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
09誌雌 7:3 Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you. Direct your heart to the LORD, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
09誌雌 7:4 So Israel put away the Baals and the Astartes, and they served the LORD only.
09誌雌 7:5 Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."
09誌雌 7:6 So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD. They fasted that day, and said, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
09誌雌 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.
09誌雌 7:8 The people of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, and pray that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines."
09誌雌 7:9 So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.
09誌雌 7:10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the LORD thundered with a mighty voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion; and they were routed before Israel.
09誌雌 7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as beyond Beth-car.
09誌雌 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, and named it Ebenezer; for he said, "Thus far the LORD has helped us."
09誌雌 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel; the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
09誌雌 7:14 The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
09誌雌 7:15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
09誌雌 7:16 He went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places.
09誌雌 7:17 Then he would come back to Ramah, for his home was there; he administered justice there to Israel, and built there an altar to the LORD.
09誌雌 8:1 When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
09誌雌 8:2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba.
09誌雌 8:3 Yet his sons did not follow in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice.
09誌雌 8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,
09誌雌 8:5 and said to him, "You are old and your sons do not follow in your ways; appoint for us, then, a king to govern us, like other nations."
09誌雌 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to govern us." Samuel prayed to the LORD,
09誌雌 8:7 and the LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
09誌雌 8:8 Just as they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so also they are doing to you.
09誌雌 8:9 Now then, listen to their voice; only--you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them."
09誌雌 8:10 So Samuel reported all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.
09誌雌 8:11 He said, "These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots;
09誌雌 8:12 and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
09誌雌 8:13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
09誌雌 8:14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers.
09誌雌 8:15 He will take one-tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and his courtiers.
09誌雌 8:16 He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and donkeys, and put them to his work.
09誌雌 8:17 He will take one-tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
09誌雌 8:18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day."
09誌雌 8:19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; they said, "No! but we are determined to have a king over us,
09誌雌 8:20 so that we also may be like other nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles."
09誌雌 8:21 When Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
09誌雌 8:22 The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to their voice and set a king over them." Samuel then said to the people of Israel, "Each of you return home."
09誌雌 9:1 There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish son of Abiel son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.
09誌雌 9:2 He had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; he stood head and shoulders above everyone else.
09誌雌 9:3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, had strayed. So Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the boys with you; go and look for the donkeys."
09誌雌 9:4 He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
09誌雌 9:5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the boy who was with him, "Let us turn back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and worry about us."
09誌雌 9:6 But he said to him, "There is a man of God in this town; he is a man held in honor. Whatever he says always comes true. Let us go there now; perhaps he will tell us about the journey on which we have set out."
09誌雌 9:7 Then Saul replied to the boy, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What have we?"
09誌雌 9:8 The boy answered Saul again, "Here, I have with me a quarter shekel of silver; I will give it to the man of God, to tell us our way."
09誌雌 9:9 (Formerly in Israel, anyone who went to inquire of God would say, "Come, let us go to the seer"; for the one who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)
09誌雌 9:10 Saul said to the boy, "Good; come, let us go." So they went to the town where the man of God was.
09誌雌 9:11 As they went up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"
09誌雌 9:12 They answered, "Yes, there he is just ahead of you. Hurry; he has come just now to the town, because the people have a sacrifice today at the shrine.
09誌雌 9:13 As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the shrine to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those eat who are invited. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately."
09誌雌 9:14 So they went up to the town. As they were entering the town, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the shrine.
09誌雌 9:15 Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel:
09誌雌 9:16 "Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen the suffering of my people, because their outcry has come to me."
09誌雌 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "Here is the man of whom I spoke to you. He it is who shall rule over my people."
09誌雌 9:18 Then Saul approached Samuel inside the gate, and said, "Tell me, please, where is the house of the seer?"
09誌雌 9:19 Samuel answered Saul, "I am the seer; go up before me to the shrine, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.
09誌雌 9:20 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, give no further thought to them, for they have been found. And on whom is all Israel's desire fixed, if not on you and on all your ancestral house?"
09誌雌 9:21 Saul answered, "I am only a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin. Why then have you spoken to me in this way?"
09誌雌 9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant-boy and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, of whom there were about thirty.
09誌雌 9:23 And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion I gave you, the one I asked you to put aside."
09誌雌 9:24 The cook took up the thigh and what went with it and set them before Saul. Samuel said, "See, what was kept is set before you. Eat; for it is set before you at the appointed time, so that you might eat with the guests." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
09誌雌 9:25 When they came down from the shrine into the town, a bed was spread for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep.
09誌雌 9:26 Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, "Get up, so that I may send you on your way." Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
09誌雌 9:27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the boy to go on before us, and when he has passed on, stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God."
09誌雌 10:1 Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him; he said, "The LORD has anointed you ruler over his people Israel. You shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their enemies all around. Now this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you ruler over his heritage:
09誌雌 10:2 When you depart from me today you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; they will say to you, 'The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has stopped worrying about them and is worrying about you, saying: What shall I do about my son?'
09誌雌 10:3 Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor; three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
09誌雌 10:4 They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from them.
09誌雌 10:5 After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, at the place where the Philistine garrison is; there, as you come to the town, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the shrine with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre playing in front of them; they will be in a prophetic frenzy.
09誌雌 10:6 Then the spirit of the LORD will possess you, and you will be in a prophetic frenzy along with them and be turned into a different person.
09誌雌 10:7 Now when these signs meet you, do whatever you see fit to do, for God is with you.
09誌雌 10:8 And you shall go down to Gilgal ahead of me; then I will come down to you to present burnt offerings and offer sacrifices of well-being. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do."
09誌雌 10:9 As he turned away to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs were fulfilled that day.
09誌雌 10:10 When they were going from there to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God possessed him, and he fell into a prophetic frenzy along with them.
09誌雌 10:11 When all who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 10:12 A man of the place answered, "And who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 10:13 When his prophetic frenzy had ended, he went home.
09誌雌 10:14 Saul's uncle said to him and to the boy, "Where did you go?" And he replied, "To seek the donkeys; and when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."
09誌雌 10:15 Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."
09誌雌 10:16 Saul said to his uncle, "He told us that the donkeys had been found." But about the matter of the kingship, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
09誌雌 10:17 Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah
09誌雌 10:18 and said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'
09誌雌 10:19 But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said, 'No! but set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans."
09誌雌 10:20 Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
09誌雌 10:21 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken by lot. Finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man, and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
09誌雌 10:22 So they inquired again of the LORD, "Did the man come here?" and the LORD said, "See, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
09誌雌 10:23 Then they ran and brought him from there. When he took his stand among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.
09誌雌 10:24 Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the one whom the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
09誌雌 10:25 Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people back to their homes.
09誌雌 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went warriors whose hearts God had touched.
09誌雌 10:27 But some worthless fellows said, "How can this man save us?" They despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace. Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead.
09誌雌 11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
09誌雌 11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone's right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel."
09誌雌 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days' respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you."
09誌雌 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the hearing of the people; and all the people wept aloud.
09誌雌 11:5 Now Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen; and Saul said, "What is the matter with the people, that they are weeping?" So they told him the message from the inhabitants of Jabesh.
09誌雌 11:6 And the spirit of God came upon Saul in power when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.
09誌雌 11:7 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!" Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one.
09誌雌 11:8 When he mustered them at Bezek, those from Israel were three hundred thousand, and those from Judah seventy thousand.
09誌雌 11:9 They said to the messengers who had come, "Thus shall you say to the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead: 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" When the messengers came and told the inhabitants of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
09誌雌 11:10 So the inhabitants of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
09誌雌 11:11 The next day Saul put the people in three companies. At the morning watch they came into the camp and cut down the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
09誌雌 11:12 The people said to Samuel, "Who is it that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Give them to us so that we may put them to death."
09誌雌 11:13 But Saul said, "No one shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has brought deliverance to Israel."
09誌雌 11:14 Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship."
09誌雌 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed offerings of well-being before the LORD, and there Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.
09誌雌 12:1 Samuel said to all Israel, "I have listened to you in all that you have said to me, and have set a king over you.
09誌雌 12:2 See, it is the king who leads you now; I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth until this day.
09誌雌 12:3 Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you."
09誌雌 12:4 They said, "You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from the hand of anyone."
09誌雌 12:5 He said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." And they said, "He is witness."
09誌雌 12:6 Samuel said to the people, "The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt.
09誌雌 12:7 Now therefore take your stand, so that I may enter into judgment with you before the LORD, and I will declare to you all the saving deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your ancestors.
09誌雌 12:8 When Jacob went into Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them, then your ancestors cried to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your ancestors out of Egypt, and settled them in this place.
09誌雌 12:9 But they forgot the LORD their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of King Jabin of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
09誌雌 12:10 Then they cried to the LORD, and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served the Baals and the Astartes; but now rescue us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.'
09誌雌 12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samson, and rescued you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
09誌雌 12:12 But when you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' though the LORD your God was your king.
09誌雌 12:13 See, here is the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; see, the LORD has set a king over you.
09誌雌 12:14 If you will fear the LORD and serve him and heed his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well;
09誌雌 12:15 but if you will not heed the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king.
09誌雌 12:16 Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
09誌雌 12:17 Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that the wickedness that you have done in the sight of the LORD is great in demanding a king for yourselves."
09誌雌 12:18 So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
09誌雌 12:19 All the people said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants, so that we may not die; for we have added to all our sins the evil of demanding a king for ourselves."
09誌雌 12:20 And Samuel said to the people, "Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
09誌雌 12:21 and do not turn aside after useless things that cannot profit or save, for they are useless.
09誌雌 12:22 For the LORD will not cast away his people, for his great name's sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself.
09誌雌 12:23 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
09誌雌 12:24 Only fear the LORD, and serve him faithfully with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you.
09誌雌 12:25 But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king."
09誌雌 13:1 Saul was. . . years old when he began to reign; and he reigned. . . and two years over Israel.
09誌雌 13:2 Saul chose three thousand out of Israel; two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; the rest of the people he sent home to their tents.
09誌雌 13:3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
09誌雌 13:4 When all Israel heard that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines, the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
09誌雌 13:5 The Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude; they came up and encamped at Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
09誌雌 13:6 When the Israelites saw that they were in distress (for the troops were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns.
09誌雌 13:7 Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
09誌雌 13:8 He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people began to slip away from Saul.
09誌雌 13:9 So Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the offerings of well-being." And he offered the burnt offering.
09誌雌 13:10 As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived; and Saul went out to meet him and salute him.
09誌雌 13:11 Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were slipping away from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines were mustering at Michmash,
09誌雌 13:12 I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of the LORD'; so I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering."
09誌雌 13:13 Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you. The LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever,
09誌雌 13:14 but now your kingdom will not continue; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart; and the LORD has appointed him to be ruler over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."
09誌雌 13:15 And Samuel left and went on his way from Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul to join the army; they went up from Gilgal toward Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
09誌雌 13:16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped at Michmash.
09誌雌 13:17 And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,
09誌雌 13:18 another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the mountain that looks down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
09誌雌 13:19 Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, "The Hebrews must not make swords or spears for themselves";
09誌雌 13:20 so all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshare, mattocks, axes, or sickles;
09誌雌 13:21 The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and one-third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.
09誌雌 13:22 So on the day of the battle neither sword nor spear was to be found in the possession of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
09誌雌 13:23 Now a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash.
09誌雌 14:1 One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
09誌雌 14:2 Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that is at Migron; the troops that were with him were about six hundred men,
09誌雌 14:3 along with Ahijah son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, carrying an ephod. Now the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
09誌雌 14:4 In the pass, by which Jonathan tried to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and a rocky crag on the other; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
09誌雌 14:5 One crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
09誌雌 14:6 Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will act for us; for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few."
09誌雌 14:7 His armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that your mind inclines to. I am with you; as your mind is, so is mine."
09誌雌 14:8 Then Jonathan said, "Now we will cross over to those men and will show ourselves to them.
09誌雌 14:9 If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
09誌雌 14:10 But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the LORD has given them into our hand. That will be the sign for us."
09誌雌 14:11 So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves."
09誌雌 14:12 The men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, saying, "Come up to us, and we will show you something." Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me; for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."
09誌雌 14:13 Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer following after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer, coming after him, killed them.
09誌雌 14:14 In that first slaughter Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men within an area about half a furrow long in an acre of land.
09誌雌 14:15 There was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.
09誌雌 14:16 Saul's lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin were watching as the multitude was surging back and forth.
09誌雌 14:17 Then Saul said to the troops that were with him, "Call the roll and see who has gone from us." When they had called the roll, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
09誌雌 14:18 Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For at that time the ark of God went with the Israelites.
09誌雌 14:19 While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
09誌雌 14:20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and every sword was against the other, so that there was very great confusion.
09誌雌 14:21 Now the Hebrews who previously had been with the Philistines and had gone up with them into the camp turned and joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
09誌雌 14:22 Likewise, when all the Israelites who had gone into hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed closely after them in the battle.
09誌雌 14:23 So the LORD gave Israel the victory that day. The battle passed beyond Beth-aven, and the troops with Saul numbered altogether about ten thousand men. The battle spread out over the hill country of Ephraim.
09誌雌 14:24 Now Saul committed a very rash act on that day. He had laid an oath on the troops, saying, "Cursed be anyone who eats food before it is evening and I have been avenged on my enemies." So none of the troops tasted food.
09誌雌 14:25 All the troops came upon a honeycomb; and there was honey on the ground.
09誌雌 14:26 When the troops came upon the honeycomb, the honey was dripping out; but they did not put their hands to their mouths, for they feared the oath.
09誌雌 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the troops with the oath; so he extended the staff that was in his hand, and dipped the tip of it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.
09誌雌 14:28 Then one of the soldiers said, "Your father strictly charged the troops with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be anyone who eats food this day.' And so the troops are faint."
09誌雌 14:29 Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
09誌雌 14:30 How much better if today the troops had eaten freely of the spoil taken from their enemies; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great."
09誌雌 14:31 After they had struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, the troops were very faint;
09誌雌 14:32 so the troops flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the troops ate them with the blood.
09誌雌 14:33 Then it was reported to Saul, "Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone before me here."
09誌雌 14:34 Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the troops, and say to them, 'Let all bring their oxen or their sheep, and slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So all of the troops brought their oxen with them that night, and slaughtered them there.
09誌雌 14:35 And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
09誌雌 14:36 Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave one of them." They said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here."
09誌雌 14:37 So Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.
09誌雌 14:38 Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people; and let us find out how this sin has arisen today.
09誌雌 14:39 For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, even if it is in my son Jonathan, he shall surely die!" But there was no one among all the people who answered him.
09誌雌 14:40 He said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side." The people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
09誌雌 14:41 Then Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant today? If this guilt is in me or in my son Jonathan, O LORD God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were indicated by the lot, but the people were cleared.
09誌雌 14:42 Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And Jonathan was taken.
09誌雌 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die."
09誌雌 14:44 Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan!"
09誌雌 14:45 Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today." So the people ransomed Jonathan, and he did not die.
09誌雌 14:46 Then Saul withdrew from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
09誌雌 14:47 When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side--against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he routed them.
09誌雌 14:48 He did valiantly, and struck down the Amalekites, and rescued Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
09誌雌 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger, Michal.
09誌雌 14:50 The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul's uncle;
09誌雌 14:51 Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
09誌雌 14:52 There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong or valiant warrior, he took him into his service.
09誌雌 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.
09誌雌 15:2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did in opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.
09誌雌 15:3 Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
09誌雌 15:4 So Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand soldiers of Judah.
09誌雌 15:5 Saul came to the city of the Amalekites and lay in wait in the valley.
09誌雌 15:6 Saul said to the Kenites, "Go! Leave! Withdraw from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites withdrew from the Amalekites.
09誌雌 15:7 Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
09誌雌 15:8 He took King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
09誌雌 15:9 Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the cattle and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was valuable, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.
09誌雌 15:10 The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
09誌雌 15:11 "I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not carried out my commands." Samuel was angry; and he cried out to the LORD all night.
09誌雌 15:12 Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, and Samuel was told, "Saul went to Carmel, where he set up a monument for himself, and on returning he passed on down to Gilgal."
09誌雌 15:13 When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, "May you be blessed by the LORD; I have carried out the command of the LORD."
09誌雌 15:14 But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of cattle that I hear?"
09誌雌 15:15 Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the cattle, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed."
09誌雌 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me last night." He replied, "Speak."
09誌雌 15:17 Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
09誌雌 15:18 And the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, 'Go, utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'
09誌雌 15:19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
09誌雌 15:20 Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
09誌雌 15:21 But from the spoil the people took sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
09誌雌 15:22 And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.
09誌雌 15:23 For rebellion is no less a sin than divination, and stubbornness is like iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."
09誌雌 15:24 Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
09誌雌 15:25 Now therefore, I pray, pardon my sin, and return with me, so that I may worship the LORD."
09誌雌 15:26 Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
09誌雌 15:27 As Samuel turned to go away, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
09誌雌 15:28 And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this very day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
09誌雌 15:29 Moreover the Glory of Israel will not recant or change his mind; for he is not a mortal, that he should change his mind."
09誌雌 15:30 Then Saul said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."
09誌雌 15:31 So Samuel turned back after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
09誌雌 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me." And Agag came to him haltingly. Agag said, "Surely this is the bitterness of death."
09誌雌 15:33 But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so your mother shall be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
09誌雌 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
09誌雌 15:35 Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD was sorry that he had made Saul king over Israel.
09誌雌 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons."
09誌雌 16:2 Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
09誌雌 16:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you."
09誌雌 16:4 Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, "Do you come peaceably?"
09誌雌 16:5 He said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
09誌雌 16:6 When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed is now before the LORD."
09誌雌 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."
09誌雌 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
09誌雌 16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
09誌雌 16:10 Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen any of these."
09誌雌 16:11 Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here."
09誌雌 16:12 He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; for this is the one."
09誌雌 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.
09誌雌 16:14 Now the spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.
09誌雌 16:15 And Saul's servants said to him, "See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
09誌雌 16:16 Let our lord now command the servants who attend you to look for someone who is skillful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will feel better."
09誌雌 16:17 So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me someone who can play well, and bring him to me."
09誌雌 16:18 One of the young men answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the LORD is with him."
09誌雌 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me your son David who is with the sheep."
09誌雌 16:20 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them by his son David to Saul.
09誌雌 16:21 And David came to Saul, and entered his service. Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
09誌雌 16:22 Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight."
09誌雌 16:23 And whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand, and Saul would be relieved and feel better, and the evil spirit would depart from him.
09誌雌 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
09誌雌 17:2 Saul and the Israelites gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and formed ranks against the Philistines.
09誌雌 17:3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
09誌雌 17:4 And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
09誌雌 17:5 He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.
09誌雌 17:6 He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
09誌雌 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him.
09誌雌 17:8 He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
09誌雌 17:9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us."
09誌雌 17:10 And the Philistine said, "Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together."
09誌雌 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
09誌雌 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.
09誌雌 17:13 The three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle; the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
09誌雌 17:14 David was the youngest; the three eldest followed Saul,
09誌雌 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
09誌雌 17:16 For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.
09誌雌 17:17 Jesse said to his son David, "Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;
09誌雌 17:18 also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare, and bring some token from them."
09誌雌 17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
09誌雌 17:20 David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry.
09誌雌 17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.
09誌雌 17:22 David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers.
09誌雌 17:23 As he talked with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.
09誌雌 17:24 All the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled from him and were very much afraid.
09誌雌 17:25 The Israelites said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. The king will greatly enrich the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter and make his family free in Israel."
09誌雌 17:26 David said to the men who stood by him, "What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
09誌雌 17:27 The people answered him in the same way, "So shall it be done for the man who kills him."
09誌雌 17:28 His eldest brother Eliab heard him talking to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David. He said, "Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart; for you have come down just to see the battle."
09誌雌 17:29 David said, "What have I done now? It was only a question."
09誌雌 17:30 He turned away from him toward another and spoke in the same way; and the people answered him again as before.
09誌雌 17:31 When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul; and he sent for him.
09誌雌 17:32 David said to Saul, "Let no one's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
09誌雌 17:33 Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth."
09誌雌 17:34 But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb from the flock,
09誌雌 17:35 I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it.
09誌雌 17:36 Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God."
09誌雌 17:37 David said, "The LORD, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine." So Saul said to David, "Go, and may the LORD be with you!"
09誌雌 17:38 Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail.
09誌雌 17:39 David strapped Saul's sword over the armor, and he tried in vain to walk, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot walk with these; for I am not used to them." So David removed them.
09誌雌 17:40 Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in his shepherd's bag, in the pouch; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.
09誌雌 17:41 The Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.
09誌雌 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.
09誌雌 17:43 The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
09誌雌 17:44 The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the field."
09誌雌 17:45 But David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
09誌雌 17:46 This very day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army this very day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
09誌雌 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD's and he will give you into our hand."
09誌雌 17:48 When the Philistine drew nearer to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
09誌雌 17:49 David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.
09誌雌 17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, striking down the Philistine and killing him; there was no sword in David's hand.
09誌雌 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine; he grasped his sword, drew it out of its sheath, and killed him; then he cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
09誌雌 17:52 The troops of Israel and Judah rose up with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.
09誌雌 17:53 The Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
09誌雌 17:54 David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
09誌雌 17:55 When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."
09誌雌 17:56 The king said, "Inquire whose son the stripling is."
09誌雌 17:57 On David's return from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
09誌雌 17:58 Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
09誌雌 18:1 When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
09誌雌 18:2 Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
09誌雌 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.
09誌雌 18:4 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that he was wearing, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
09誌雌 18:5 David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; as a result, Saul set him over the army. And all the people, even the servants of Saul, approved.
09誌雌 18:6 As they were coming home, when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.
09誌雌 18:7 And the women sang to one another as they made merry, "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
09誌雌 18:8 Saul was very angry, for this saying displeased him. He said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; what more can he have but the kingdom?"
09誌雌 18:9 So Saul eyed David from that day on.
09誌雌 18:10 The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;
09誌雌 18:11 and Saul threw the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.
09誌雌 18:12 Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.
09誌雌 18:13 So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and David marched out and came in, leading the army.
09誌雌 18:14 David had success in all his undertakings; for the LORD was with him.
09誌雌 18:15 When Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.
09誌雌 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for it was he who marched out and came in leading them.
09誌雌 18:17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the LORD's battles." For Saul thought, "I will not raise a hand against him; let the Philistines deal with him."
09誌雌 18:18 David said to Saul, "Who am I and who are my kinsfolk, my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
09誌雌 18:19 But at the time when Saul's daughter Merab should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.
09誌雌 18:20 Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David. Saul was told, and the thing pleased him.
09誌雌 18:21 Saul thought, "Let me give her to him that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David a second time, "You shall now be my son-in-law."
09誌雌 18:22 Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in private and say, 'See, the king is delighted with you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the king's son-in-law.'"
09誌雌 18:23 So Saul's servants reported these words to David in private. And David said, "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?"
09誌雌 18:24 The servants of Saul told him, "This is what David said."
09誌雌 18:25 Then Saul said, "Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged on the king's enemies.'" Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
09誌雌 18:26 When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
09誌雌 18:27 David rose and went, along with his men, and killed one hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife.
09誌雌 18:28 But when Saul realized that the LORD was with David, and that Saul's daughter Michal loved him,
09誌雌 18:29 Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy from that time forward.
09誌雌 18:30 Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle; and as often as they came out, David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his fame became very great.
09誌雌 19:1 Saul spoke with his son Jonathan and with all his servants about killing David. But Saul's son Jonathan took great delight in David.
09誌雌 19:2 Jonathan told David, "My father Saul is trying to kill you; therefore be on guard tomorrow morning; stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
09誌雌 19:3 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you; if I learn anything I will tell you."
09誌雌 19:4 Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul, saying to him, "The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been of good service to you;
09誌雌 19:5 for he took his life in his hand when he attacked the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced; why then will you sin against an innocent person by killing David without cause?"
09誌雌 19:6 Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."
09誌雌 19:7 So Jonathan called David and related all these things to him. Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
09誌雌 19:8 Again there was war, and David went out to fight the Philistines. He launched a heavy attack on them, so that they fled before him.
09誌雌 19:9 Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing music.
09誌雌 19:10 Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.
09誌雌 19:11 Saul sent messengers to David's house to keep watch over him, planning to kill him in the morning. David's wife Michal told him, "If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
09誌雌 19:12 So Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped.
09誌雌 19:13 Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed; she put a net of goats' hair on its head, and covered it with the clothes.
09誌雌 19:14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
09誌雌 19:15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David for themselves. He said, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
09誌雌 19:16 When the messengers came in, the idol was in the bed, with the covering of goats' hair on its head.
09誌雌 19:17 Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" Michal answered Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go; why should I kill you?'"
09誌雌 19:18 Now David fled and escaped; he came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and settled at Naioth.
09誌雌 19:19 Saul was told, "David is at Naioth in Ramah."
09誌雌 19:20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David. When they saw the company of the prophets in a frenzy, with Samuel standing in charge of them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also fell into a prophetic frenzy.
09誌雌 19:21 When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also fell into a frenzy. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also fell into a frenzy.
09誌雌 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah. He came to the great well that is in Secu; he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" And someone said, "They are at Naioth in Ramah."
09誌雌 19:23 He went there, toward Naioth in Ramah; and the spirit of God came upon him. As he was going, he fell into a prophetic frenzy, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
09誌雌 19:24 He too stripped off his clothes, and he too fell into a frenzy before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore it is said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 20:1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came before Jonathan and said, "What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin against your father that he is trying to take my life?"
09誌雌 20:2 He said to him, "Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me; and why should my father hide this from me? Never!"
09誌雌 20:3 But David also swore, "Your father knows well that you like me; and he thinks, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.' But truly, as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death."
09誌雌 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
09誌雌 20:5 David said to Jonathan, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at the meal; but let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the third evening.
09誌雌 20:6 If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
09誌雌 20:7 If he says, 'Good!' it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that evil has been determined by him.
09誌雌 20:8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?"
09誌雌 20:9 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! If I knew that it was decided by my father that evil should come upon you, would I not tell you?"
09誌雌 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
09誌雌 20:11 Jonathan replied to David, "Come, let us go out into the field." So they both went out into the field.
09誌雌 20:12 Jonathan said to David, "By the LORD, the God of Israel! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or on the third day, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?
09誌雌 20:13 But if my father intends to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, if I do not disclose it to you, and send you away, so that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
09誌雌 20:14 If I am still alive, show me the faithful love of the LORD; but if I die,
09誌雌 20:15 never cut off your faithful love from my house, even if the LORD were to cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."
09誌雌 20:16 Thus Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD seek out the enemies of David."
09誌雌 20:17 Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him; for he loved him as he loved his own life.
09誌雌 20:18 Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon; you will be missed, because your place will be empty.
09誌雌 20:19 On the day after tomorrow, you shall go a long way down; go to the place where you hid yourself earlier, and remain beside the stone there.
09誌雌 20:20 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
09誌雌 20:21 Then I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, collect them,' then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
09誌雌 20:22 But if I say to the young man, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go; for the LORD has sent you away.
09誌雌 20:23 As for the matter about which you and I have spoken, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."
09誌雌 20:24 So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat at the feast to eat.
09誌雌 20:25 The king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall. Jonathan stood, while Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty.
09誌雌 20:26 Saul did not say anything that day; for he thought, "Something has befallen him; he is not clean, surely he is not clean."
09誌雌 20:27 But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast, either yesterday or today?"
09誌雌 20:28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem;
09誌雌 20:29 he said, 'Let me go; for our family is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your sight, let me get away, and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."
09誌雌 20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan. He said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
09誌雌 20:31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die."
09誌雌 20:32 Then Jonathan answered his father Saul, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
09誌雌 20:33 But Saul threw his spear at him to strike him; so Jonathan knew that it was the decision of his father to put David to death.
09誌雌 20:34 Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food on the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, and because his father had disgraced him.
09誌雌 20:35 In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him was a little boy.
09誌雌 20:36 He said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
09誌雌 20:37 When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called after the boy and said, "Is the arrow not beyond you?"
09誌雌 20:38 Jonathan called after the boy, "Hurry, be quick, do not linger." So Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
09誌雌 20:39 But the boy knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.
09誌雌 20:40 Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said to him, "Go and carry them to the city."
09誌雌 20:41 As soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. He bowed three times, and they kissed each other, and wept with each other; David wept the more.
09誌雌 20:42 Then Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, since both of us have sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants, forever.'" He got up and left; and Jonathan went into the city.
09誌雌 21:1 David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"
09誌雌 21:2 David said to the priest Ahimelech, "The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, 'No one must know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
09誌雌 21:3 Now then, what have you at hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here."
09誌雌 21:4 The priest answered David, "I have no ordinary bread at hand, only holy bread--provided that the young men have kept themselves from women."
09誌雌 21:5 David answered the priest, "Indeed women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition; the vessels of the young men are holy even when it is a common journey; how much more today will their vessels be holy?"
09誌雌 21:6 So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.
09誌雌 21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.
09誌雌 21:8 David said to Ahimelech, "Is there no spear or sword here with you? I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
09誌雌 21:9 The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it, for there is none here except that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
09誌雌 21:10 David rose and fled that day from Saul; he went to King Achish of Gath.
09誌雌 21:11 The servants of Achish said to him, "Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
09誌雌 21:12 David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of King Achish of Gath.
09誌雌 21:13 So he changed his behavior before them; he pretended to be mad when in their presence. He scratched marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down his beard.
09誌雌 21:14 Achish said to his servants, "Look, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?
09誌雌 21:15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
09誌雌 22:1 David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; when his brothers and all his father's house heard of it, they went down there to him.
09誌雌 22:2 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Those who were with him numbered about four hundred.
09誌雌 22:3 David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother come to you, until I know what God will do for me."
09誌雌 22:4 He left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
09誌雌 22:5 Then the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in the stronghold; leave, and go into the land of Judah." So David left, and went into the forest of Hereth.
09誌雌 22:6 Saul heard that David and those who were with him had been located. Saul was sitting at Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
09誌雌 22:7 Saul said to his servants who stood around him, "Hear now, you Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
09誌雌 22:8 Is that why all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse, none of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as he is doing today."
09誌雌 22:9 Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, answered, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub;
09誌雌 22:10 he inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
09誌雌 22:11 The king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and for all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob; and all of them came to the king.
09誌雌 22:12 Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." He answered, "Here I am, my lord."
09誌雌 22:13 Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as he is doing today?"
09誌雌 22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, "Who among all your servants is so faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law, and is quick to do your bidding, and is honored in your house.
09誌雌 22:15 Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? By no means! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant or to any member of my father's house; for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little."
09誌雌 22:16 The king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house."
09誌雌 22:17 The king said to the guard who stood around him, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David; they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king would not raise their hand to attack the priests of the LORD.
09誌雌 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You, Doeg, turn and attack the priests." Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests; on that day he killed eighty-five who wore the linen ephod.
09誌雌 22:19 Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep, he put to the sword.
09誌雌 22:20 But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
09誌雌 22:21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
09誌雌 22:22 David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the lives of all your father's house.
09誌雌 22:23 Stay with me, and do not be afraid; for the one who seeks my life seeks your life; you will be safe with me."
09誌雌 23:1 Now they told David, "The Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors."
09誌雌 23:2 David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah."
09誌雌 23:3 But David's men said to him, "Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
09誌雌 23:4 Then David inquired of the LORD again. The LORD answered him, "Yes, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
09誌雌 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, fought with the Philistines, brought away their livestock, and dealt them a heavy defeat. Thus David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.
09誌雌 23:6 When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
09誌雌 23:7 Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, "God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars."
09誌雌 23:8 Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
09誌雌 23:9 When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to the priest Abiathar, "Bring the ephod here."
09誌雌 23:10 David said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.
09誌雌 23:11 And now, will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant." The LORD said, "He will come down."
09誌雌 23:12 Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?" The LORD said, "They will surrender you."
09誌雌 23:13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they wandered wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.
09誌雌 23:14 David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but the LORD did not give him into his hand.
09誌雌 23:15 David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh when he learned that Saul had come out to seek his life.
09誌雌 23:16 Saul's son Jonathan set out and came to David at Horesh; there he strengthened his hand through the LORD.
09誌雌 23:17 He said to him, "Do not be afraid; for the hand of my father Saul shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; my father Saul also knows that this is so."
09誌雌 23:18 Then the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
09誌雌 23:19 Then some Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "David is hiding among us in the strongholds of Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon.
09誌雌 23:20 Now, O king, whenever you wish to come down, do so; and our part will be to surrender him into the king's hand."
09誌雌 23:21 Saul said, "May you be blessed by the LORD for showing me compassion!
09誌雌 23:22 Go and make sure once more; find out exactly where he is, and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning.
09誌雌 23:23 Look around and learn all the hiding places where he lurks, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
09誌雌 23:24 So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.
09誌雌 23:25 Saul and his men went to search for him. When David was told, he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon.
09誌雌 23:26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
09誌雌 23:27 Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land."
09誌雌 23:28 So Saul stopped pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.
09誌雌 23:29 David then went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.
09誌雌 24:1 When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the wilderness of En-gedi."
09誌雌 24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to look for David and his men in the direction of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
09誌雌 24:3 He came to the sheepfolds beside the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.
09誌雌 24:4 The men of David said to him, "Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David went and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's cloak.
09誌雌 24:5 Afterward David was stricken to the heart because he had cut off a corner of Saul's cloak.
09誌雌 24:6 He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to raise my hand against him; for he is the LORD's anointed."
09誌雌 24:7 So David scolded his men severely and did not permit them to attack Saul. Then Saul got up and left the cave, and went on his way.
09誌雌 24:8 Afterwards David also rose up and went out of the cave and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
09誌雌 24:9 David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of those who say, 'David seeks to do you harm'?
09誌雌 24:10 This very day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you into my hand in the cave; and some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not raise my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.'
09誌雌 24:11 See, my father, see the corner of your cloak in my hand; for by the fact that I cut off the corner of your cloak, and did not kill you, you may know for certain that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you are hunting me to take my life.
09誌雌 24:12 May the LORD judge between me and you! May the LORD avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you.
09誌雌 24:13 As the ancient proverb says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness'; but my hand shall not be against you.
09誌雌 24:14 Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A single flea?
09誌雌 24:15 May the LORD therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you. May he see to it, and plead my cause, and vindicate me against you."
09誌雌 24:16 When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
09誌雌 24:17 He said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.
09誌雌 24:18 Today you have explained how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands.
09誌雌 24:19 For who has ever found an enemy, and sent the enemy safely away? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
09誌雌 24:20 Now I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
09誌雌 24:21 Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not wipe out my name from my father's house."
09誌雌 24:22 So David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
09誌雌 25:1 Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David got up and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
09誌雌 25:2 There was a man in Maon, whose property was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
09誌雌 25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was clever and beautiful, but the man was surly and mean; he was a Calebite.
09誌雌 25:4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
09誌雌 25:5 So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.
09誌雌 25:6 Thus you shall salute him: 'Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
09誌雌 25:7 I hear that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing, all the time they were in Carmel.
09誌雌 25:8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your sight; for we have come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'"
09誌雌 25:9 When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David; and then they waited.
09誌雌 25:10 But Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are breaking away from their masters.
09誌雌 25:11 Shall I take my bread and my water and the meat that I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"
09誌雌 25:12 So David's young men turned away, and came back and told him all this.
09誌雌 25:13 David said to his men, "Every man strap on his sword!" And every one of them strapped on his sword; David also strapped on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
09誌雌 25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, "David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he shouted insults at them.
09誌雌 25:15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we never missed anything when we were in the fields, as long as we were with them;
09誌雌 25:16 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
09誌雌 25:17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do; for evil has been decided against our master and against all his house; he is so ill-natured that no one can speak to him."
09誌雌 25:18 Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves, two skins of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs. She loaded them on donkeys
09誌雌 25:19 and said to her young men, "Go on ahead of me; I am coming after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
09誌雌 25:20 As she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
09誌雌 25:21 Now David had said, "Surely it was in vain that I protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; but he has returned me evil for good.
09誌雌 25:22 God do so to David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him."
09誌雌 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and alighted from the donkey, fell before David on her face, bowing to the ground.
09誌雌 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, "Upon me alone, my lord, be the guilt; please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.
09誌雌 25:25 My lord, do not take seriously this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
09誌雌 25:26 Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, since the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from taking vengeance with your own hand, now let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be like Nabal.
09誌雌 25:27 And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
09誌雌 25:28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD; and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.
09誌雌 25:29 If anyone should rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living under the care of the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
09誌雌 25:30 When the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,
09誌雌 25:31 my lord shall have no cause of grief, or pangs of conscience, for having shed blood without cause or for having saved himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant."
09誌雌 25:32 David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today!
09誌雌 25:33 Blessed be your good sense, and blessed be you, who have kept me today from bloodguilt and from avenging myself by my own hand!
09誌雌 25:34 For as surely as the LORD the God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there would not have been left to Nabal so much as one male."
09誌雌 25:35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought him; he said to her, "Go up to your house in peace; see, I have heeded your voice, and I have granted your petition."
09誌雌 25:36 Abigail came to Nabal; he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
09誌雌 25:37 In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him; he became like a stone.
09誌雌 25:38 About ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
09誌雌 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD who has judged the case of Nabal's insult to me, and has kept back his servant from evil; the LORD has returned the evil-doing of Nabal upon his own head." Then David sent and wooed Abigail, to make her his wife.
09誌雌 25:40 When David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."
09誌雌 25:41 She rose and bowed down, with her face to the ground, and said, "Your servant is a slave to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
09誌雌 25:42 Abigail got up hurriedly and rode away on a donkey; her five maids attended her. She went after the messengers of David and became his wife.
09誌雌 25:43 David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them became his wives.
09誌雌 25:44 Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
09誌雌 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "David is in hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon."
09誌雌 26:2 So Saul rose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.
09誌雌 26:3 Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon beside the road. But David remained in the wilderness. When he learned that Saul came after him into the wilderness,
09誌雌 26:4 David sent out spies, and learned that Saul had indeed arrived.
09誌雌 26:5 Then David set out and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.
09誌雌 26:6 Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
09誌雌 26:7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night; there Saul lay sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay around him.
09誌雌 26:8 Abishai said to David, "God has given your enemy into your hand today; now therefore let me pin him to the ground with one stroke of the spear; I will not strike him twice."
09誌雌 26:9 But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him; for who can raise his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?"
09誌雌 26:10 David said, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him down; or his day will come to die; or he will go down into battle and perish.
09誌雌 26:11 The LORD forbid that I should raise my hand against the LORD's anointed; but now take the spear that is at his head, and the water jar, and let us go."
09誌雌 26:12 So David took the spear that was at Saul's head and the water jar, and they went away. No one saw it, or knew it, nor did anyone awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
09誌雌 26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on top of a hill far away, with a great distance between them.
09誌雌 26:14 David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, saying, "Abner! Will you not answer?" Then Abner replied, "Who are you that calls to the king?"
09誌雌 26:15 David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.
09誌雌 26:16 This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD's anointed. See now, where is the king's spear, or the water jar that was at his head?"
09誌雌 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice, and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."
09誌雌 26:18 And he added, "Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What guilt is on my hands?
09誌雌 26:19 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering; but if it is mortals, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out today from my share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
09誌雌 26:20 Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the ground, away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains."
09誌雌 26:21 Then Saul said, "I have done wrong; come back, my son David, for I will never harm you again, because my life was precious in your sight today; I have been a fool, and have made a great mistake."
09誌雌 26:22 David replied, "Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and get it.
09誌雌 26:23 The LORD rewards everyone for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD gave you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the LORD's anointed.
09誌雌 26:24 As your life was precious today in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he rescue me from all tribulation."
09誌雌 26:25 Then Saul said to David, "Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them." So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
09誌雌 27:1 David said in his heart, "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines; then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand."
09誌雌 27:2 So David set out and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath.
09誌雌 27:3 David stayed with Achish at Gath, he and his troops, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
09誌雌 27:4 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought for him.
09誌雌 27:5 Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your sight, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, so that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
09誌雌 27:6 So that day Achish gave him Ziklag; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
09誌雌 27:7 The length of time that David lived in the country of the Philistines was one year and four months.
09誌雌 27:8 Now David and his men went up and made raids on the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for these were the landed settlements from Telam on the way to Shur and on to the land of Egypt.
09誌雌 27:9 David struck the land, leaving neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing, and came back to Achish.
09誌雌 27:10 When Achish asked, "Against whom have you made a raid today?" David would say, "Against the Negeb of Judah," or "Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites," or, "Against the Negeb of the Kenites."
09誌雌 27:11 David left neither man nor woman alive to be brought back to Gath, thinking, "They might tell about us, and say, 'David has done so and so.'" Such was his practice all the time he lived in the country of the Philistines.
09誌雌 27:12 Achish trusted David, thinking, "He has made himself utterly abhorrent to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant."
09誌雌 28:1 In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You know, of course, that you and your men are to go out with me in the army."
09誌雌 28:2 David said to Achish, "Very well, then you shall know what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
09誌雌 28:3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. Saul had expelled the mediums and the wizards from the land.
09誌雌 28:4 The Philistines assembled, and came and encamped at Shunem. Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
09誌雌 28:5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
09誌雌 28:6 When Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, not by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
09誌雌 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her." His servants said to him, "There is a medium at Endor."
09誌雌 28:8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went there, he and two men with him. They came to the woman by night. And he said, "Consult a spirit for me, and bring up for me the one whom I name to you."
09誌雌 28:9 The woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?"
09誌雌 28:10 But Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing."
09誌雌 28:11 Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He answered, "Bring up Samuel for me."
09誌雌 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
09誌雌 28:13 The king said to her, "Have no fear; what do you see?" The woman said to Saul, "I see a divine being coming up out of the ground."
09誌雌 28:14 He said to her, "What is his appearance?" She said, "An old man is coming up; he is wrapped in a robe." So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
09誌雌 28:15 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have summoned you to tell me what I should do."
09誌雌 28:16 Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?
09誌雌 28:17 The LORD has done to you just as he spoke by me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David.
09誌雌 28:18 Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD, and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you today.
09誌雌 28:19 Moreover the LORD will give Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me; the LORD will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines."
09誌雌 28:20 Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
09誌雌 28:21 The woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, "Your servant has listened to you; I have taken my life in my hand, and have listened to what you have said to me.
09誌雌 28:22 Now therefore, you also listen to your servant; let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way."
09誌雌 28:23 He refused, and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he listened to their words. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
09誌雌 28:24 Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house. She quickly slaughtered it, and she took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.
09誌雌 28:25 She put them before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
09誌雌 29:1 Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, while the Israelites were encamped by the fountain that is in Jezreel.
09誌雌 29:2 As the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear with Achish,
09誌雌 29:3 the commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years? Since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day."
09誌雌 29:4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Send the man back, so that he may return to the place that you have assigned to him; he shall not go down with us to battle, or else he may become an adversary to us in the battle. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?
09誌雌 29:5 Is this not David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
09誌雌 29:6 Then Achish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign; for I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me until today. Nevertheless the lords do not approve of you.
09誌雌 29:7 So go back now; and go peaceably; do nothing to displease the lords of the Philistines."
09誌雌 29:8 David said to Achish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
09誌雌 29:9 Achish replied to David, "I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
09誌雌 29:10 Now then rise early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place that I appointed for you. As for the evil report, do not take it to heart, for you have done well before me. Start early in the morning, and leave as soon as you have light."
09誌雌 29:11 So David set out with his men early in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
09誌雌 30:1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negeb and on Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag, burned it down,
09誌雌 30:2 and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great; they killed none of them, but carried them off, and went their way.
09誌雌 30:3 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
09誌雌 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept, until they had no more strength to weep.
09誌雌 30:5 David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
09誌雌 30:6 David was in great danger; for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in spirit for their sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
09誌雌 30:7 David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
09誌雌 30:8 David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this band? Shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue; for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue."
09誌雌 30:9 So David set out, he and the six hundred men who were with him. They came to the Wadi Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.
09誌雌 30:10 But David went on with the pursuit, he and four hundred men; two hundred stayed behind, too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor.
09誌雌 30:11 In the open country they found an Egyptian, and brought him to David. They gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to drink;
09誌雌 30:12 they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
09誌雌 30:13 Then David said to him, "To whom do you belong? Where are you from?" He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite. My master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
09誌雌 30:14 We had made a raid on the Negeb of the Cherethites and on that which belongs to Judah and on the Negeb of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag down."
09誌雌 30:15 David said to him, "Will you take me down to this raiding party?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me, or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."
09誌雌 30:16 When he had taken him down, they were spread out all over the ground, eating and drinking and dancing, because of the great amount of spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
09誌雌 30:17 David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.
09誌雌 30:18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
09誌雌 30:19 Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David brought back everything.
09誌雌 30:20 David also captured all the flocks and herds, which were driven ahead of the other cattle; people said, "This is David's spoil."
09誌雌 30:21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. When David drew near to the people he saluted them.
09誌雌 30:22 Then all the corrupt and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may take his wife and children, and leave."
09誌雌 30:23 But David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us; he has preserved us and handed over to us the raiding party that attacked us.
09誌雌 30:24 Who would listen to you in this matter? For the share of the one who goes down into the battle shall be the same as the share of the one who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike."
09誌雌 30:25 From that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel; it continues to the present day.
09誌雌 30:26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD";
09誌雌 30:27 it was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,
09誌雌 30:28 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoa,
09誌雌 30:29 in Racal, in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, in the towns of the Kenites,
09誌雌 30:30 in Hormah, in Bor-ashan, in Athach,
09誌雌 30:31 in Hebron, all the places where David and his men had roamed.
09誌雌 31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and many fell on Mount Gilboa.
09誌雌 31:2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
09誌雌 31:3 The battle pressed hard upon Saul; the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by them.
09誌雌 31:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, so that these uncircumcised may not come and thrust me through, and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer was unwilling; for he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
09誌雌 31:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
09誌雌 31:6 So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together on the same day.
09誌雌 31:7 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their towns and fled; and the Philistines came and occupied them.
09誌雌 31:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
09誌雌 31:9 They cut off his head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to the houses of their idols and to the people.
09誌雌 31:10 They put his armor in the temple of Astarte; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
09誌雌 31:11 But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
09誌雌 31:12 all the valiant men set out, traveled all night long, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. They came to Jabesh and burned them there.
09誌雌 31:13 Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

10誌馬 1:1 After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
10誌馬 1:2 On the third day, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.
10誌馬 1:3 David said to him, "Where have you come from?" He said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."
10誌馬 1:4 David said to him, "How did things go? Tell me!" He answered, "The army fled from the battle, but also many of the army fell and died; and Saul and his son Jonathan also died."
10誌馬 1:5 Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?"
10誌馬 1:6 The young man reporting to him said, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa; and there was Saul leaning on his spear, while the chariots and the horsemen drew close to him.
10誌馬 1:7 When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here sir.'
10誌馬 1:8 And he said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
10誌馬 1:9 He said to me, 'Come, stand over me and kill me; for convulsions have seized me, and yet my life still lingers.'
10誌馬 1:10 So I stood over him, and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."
10誌馬 1:11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did the same.
10誌馬 1:12 They mourned and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
10誌馬 1:13 David said to the young man who had reported to him, "Where do you come from?" He answered, "I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite."
10誌馬 1:14 David said to him, "Were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
10誌馬 1:15 Then David called one of the young men and said, "Come here and strike him down." So he struck him down and he died.
10誌馬 1:16 David said to him, "Your blood be on your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'"
10誌馬 1:17 David intoned this lamentation over Saul and his son Jonathan.
10誌馬 1:18 (He ordered that The Song of the Bow be taught to the people of Judah; it is written in the Book of Jashar.) He said:
10誌馬 1:19 Your glory, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
10誌馬 1:20 Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.
10誌馬 1:21 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor bounteous fields! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, anointed with oil no more.
10誌馬 1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, nor the sword of Saul return empty.
10誌馬 1:23 Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
10誌馬 1:24 O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with crimson, in luxury, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
10誌馬 1:25 How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.
10誌馬 1:26 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
10誌馬 1:27 How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
10誌馬 2:1 After this David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" The LORD said to him, "Go up." David said, "To which shall I go up?" He said, "To Hebron."
10誌馬 2:2 So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
10誌馬 2:3 David brought up the men who were with him, every one with his household; and they settled in the towns of Hebron.
10誌馬 2:4 Then the people of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When they told David, "It was the people of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,"
10誌馬 2:5 David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, "May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord, and buried him!
10誌馬 2:6 Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you! And I too will reward you because you have done this thing.
10誌馬 2:7 Therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
10誌馬 2:8 But Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ishbaal son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.
10誌馬 2:9 He made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and over all Israel.
10誌馬 2:10 Ishbaal, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
10誌馬 2:11 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
10誌馬 2:12 Abner son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbaal son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
10誌馬 2:13 Joab son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat on one side of the pool, while the other sat on the other side of the pool.
10誌馬 2:14 Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men come forward and have a contest before us." Joab said, "Let them come forward."
10誌馬 2:15 So they came forward and were counted as they passed by, twelve for Benjamin and Ishbaal son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
10誌馬 2:16 Each grasped his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon.
10誌馬 2:17 The battle was very fierce that day; and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten by the servants of David.
10誌馬 2:18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle.
10誌馬 2:19 Asahel pursued Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he followed him.
10誌馬 2:20 Then Abner looked back and said, "Is it you, Asahel?" He answered, "Yes, it is."
10誌馬 2:21 Abner said to him, "Turn to your right or to your left, and seize one of the young men, and take his spoil." But Asahel would not turn away from following him.
10誌馬 2:22 Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn away from following me; why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I show my face to your brother Joab?"
10誌馬 2:23 But he refused to turn away. So Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. He fell there, and died where he lay. And all those who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
10誌馬 2:24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. As the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
10誌馬 2:25 The Benjaminites rallied around Abner and formed a single band; they took their stand on the top of a hill.
10誌馬 2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, "Is the sword to keep devouring forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you order your people to turn from the pursuit of their kinsmen?"
10誌馬 2:27 Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, the people would have continued to pursue their kinsmen, not stopping until morning."
10誌馬 2:28 Joab sounded the trumpet and all the people stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or engaged in battle any further.
10誌馬 2:29 Abner and his men traveled all that night through the Arabah; they crossed the Jordan, and, marching the whole forenoon, they came to Mahanaim.
10誌馬 2:30 Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
10誌馬 2:31 But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin three hundred sixty of Abner's men.
10誌馬 2:32 They took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
10誌馬 3:1 There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
10誌馬 3:2 Sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
10誌馬 3:3 his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom son of Maacah, daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
10誌馬 3:4 the fourth, Adonijah son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah son of Abital;
10誌馬 3:5 and the sixth, Ithream, of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
10誌馬 3:6 While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
10誌馬 3:7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ishbaal said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
10誌馬 3:8 The words of Ishbaal made Abner very angry; he said, "Am I a dog's head for Judah? Today I keep showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me now with a crime concerning this woman.
10誌馬 3:9 So may God do to Abner and so may he add to it! For just what the LORD has sworn to David, that will I accomplish for him,
10誌馬 3:10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba."
10誌馬 3:11 And Ishbaal could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
10誌馬 3:12 Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and I will give you my support to bring all Israel over to you."
10誌馬 3:13 He said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall never appear in my presence unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal when you come to see me."
10誌馬 3:14 Then David sent messengers to Saul's son Ishbaal, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, to whom I became engaged at the price of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10誌馬 3:15 Ishbaal sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.
10誌馬 3:16 But her husband went with her, weeping as he walked behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.
10誌馬 3:17 Abner sent word to the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
10誌馬 3:18 Now then bring it about; for the LORD has promised David: Through my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from all their enemies."
10誌馬 3:19 Abner also spoke directly to the Benjaminites; then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin were ready to do.
10誌馬 3:20 When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
10誌馬 3:21 Abner said to David, "Let me go and rally all Israel to my lord the king, in order that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David dismissed Abner, and he went away in peace.
10誌馬 3:22 Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for David had dismissed him, and he had gone away in peace.
10誌馬 3:23 When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, "Abner son of Ner came to the king, and he has dismissed him, and he has gone away in peace."
10誌馬 3:24 Then Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner came to you; why did you dismiss him, so that he got away?
10誌馬 3:25 You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you, and to learn your comings and goings and to learn all that you are doing."
10誌馬 3:26 When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.
10誌馬 3:27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway to speak with him privately, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. So he died for shedding the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother.
10誌馬 3:28 Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner son of Ner.
10誌馬 3:29 May the guilt fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks food!"
10誌馬 3:30 So Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
10誌馬 3:31 Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourn over Abner." And King David followed the bier.
10誌馬 3:32 They buried Abner at Hebron. The king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
10誌馬 3:33 The king lamented for Abner, saying, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?
10誌馬 3:34 Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen." And all the people wept over him again.
10誌馬 3:35 Then all the people came to persuade David to eat something while it was still day; but David swore, saying, "So may God do to me, and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!"
10誌馬 3:36 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; just as everything the king did pleased all the people.
10誌馬 3:37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner.
10誌馬 3:38 And the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
10誌馬 3:39 Today I am powerless, even though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too violent for me. The LORD pay back the one who does wickedly in accordance with his wickedness!"
10誌馬 4:1 When Saul's son Ishbaal heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
10誌馬 4:2 Saul's son had two captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab. They were sons of Rimmon a Benjaminite from Beeroth--for Beeroth is considered to belong to Benjamin.
10誌馬 4:3 (Now the people of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim and are there as resident aliens to this day).
10誌馬 4:4 Saul's son Jonathan had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled; and, in her haste to flee, it happened that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
10誌馬 4:5 Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ishbaal, while he was taking his noonday rest.
10誌馬 4:6 They came inside the house as though to take wheat, and they struck him in the stomach; then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.
10誌馬 4:7 Now they had come into the house while he was lying on his couch in his bedchamber; they attacked him, killed him, and beheaded him. Then they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night long.
10誌馬 4:8 They brought the head of Ishbaal to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ishbaal, son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring."
10誌馬 4:9 David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
10誌馬 4:10 when the one who told me, 'See, Saul is dead,' thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag--this was the reward I gave him for his news.
10誌馬 4:11 How much more then, when wicked men have killed a righteous man on his bed in his own house! And now shall I not require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?"
10誌馬 4:12 So David commanded the young men, and they killed them; they cut off their hands and feet, and hung their bodies beside the pool at Hebron. But the head of Ishbaal they took and buried in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
10誌馬 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, "Look, we are your bone and flesh.
10誌馬 5:2 For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in. The LORD said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel."
10誌馬 5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
10誌馬 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
10誌馬 5:5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
10誌馬 5:6 The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, "You will not come in here, even the blind and the lame will turn you back"--thinking, "David cannot come in here."
10誌馬 5:7 Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David.
10誌馬 5:8 David had said on that day, "Whoever would strike down the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, those whom David hates." Therefore it is said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
10誌馬 5:9 David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
10誌馬 5:10 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
10誌馬 5:11 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, and carpenters and masons who built David a house.
10誌馬 5:12 David then perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
10誌馬 5:13 In Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives; and more sons and daughters were born to David.
10誌馬 5:14 These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
10誌馬 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
10誌馬 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
10誌馬 5:17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.
10誌馬 5:18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 5:19 David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?" The LORD said to David, "Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."
10誌馬 5:20 So David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. He said, "The LORD has burst forth against my enemies before me, like a bursting flood." Therefore that place is called Baal-perazim.
10誌馬 5:21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
10誌馬 5:22 Once again the Philistines came up, and were spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 5:23 When David inquired of the LORD, he said, "You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.
10誌馬 5:24 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then be on the alert; for then the LORD has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
10誌馬 5:25 David did just as the LORD had commanded him; and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.
10誌馬 6:1 David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
10誌馬 6:2 David and all the people with him set out and went from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned on the cherubim.
10誌馬 6:3 They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart
10誌馬 6:4 with the ark of God; and Ahio went in front of the ark.
10誌馬 6:5 David and all the house of Israel were dancing before the LORD with all their might, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.
10誌馬 6:6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook it.
10誌馬 6:7 The anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there because he reached out his hand to the ark; and he died there beside the ark of God.
10誌馬 6:8 David was angry because the LORD had burst forth with an outburst upon Uzzah; so that place is called Perez-uzzah, to this day.
10誌馬 6:9 David was afraid of the LORD that day; he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come into my care?"
10誌馬 6:10 So David was unwilling to take the ark of the LORD into his care in the city of David; instead David took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
10誌馬 6:11 The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
10誌馬 6:12 It was told King David, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing;
10誌馬 6:13 and when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
10誌馬 6:14 David danced before the LORD with all his might; David was girded with a linen ephod.
10誌馬 6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
10誌馬 6:16 As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
10誌馬 6:17 They brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being before the LORD.
10誌馬 6:18 When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts,
10誌馬 6:19 and distributed food among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people went back to their homes.
10誌馬 6:20 David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' maids, as any vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!"
10誌馬 6:21 David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me in place of your father and all his household, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the LORD, that I have danced before the LORD.
10誌馬 6:22 I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in my own eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor."
10誌馬 6:23 And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
10誌馬 7:1 Now when the king was settled in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
10誌馬 7:2 the king said to the prophet Nathan, "See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent."
10誌馬 7:3 Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that you have in mind; for the LORD is with you."
10誌馬 7:4 But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan:
10誌馬 7:5 Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the LORD: Are you the one to build me a house to live in?
10誌馬 7:6 I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent and a tabernacle.
10誌馬 7:7 Wherever I have moved about among all the people of Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the tribal leaders of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"
10誌馬 7:8 Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel;
10誌馬 7:9 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
10誌馬 7:10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
10誌馬 7:11 from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.
10誌馬 7:12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
10誌馬 7:13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
10誌馬 7:14 I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. When he commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use, with blows inflicted by human beings.
10誌馬 7:15 But I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
10誌馬 7:16 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.
10誌馬 7:17 In accordance with all these words and with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
10誌馬 7:18 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
10誌馬 7:19 And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD; you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come. May this be instruction for the people, O Lord GOD!
10誌馬 7:20 And what more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Lord GOD!
10誌馬 7:21 Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have wrought all this greatness, so that your servant may know it.
10誌馬 7:22 Therefore you are great, O LORD God; for there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
10誌馬 7:23 Who is like your people, like Israel? Is there another nation on earth whose God went to redeem it as a people, and to make a name for himself, doing great and awesome things for them, by driving out before his people nations and their gods?
10誌馬 7:24 And you established your people Israel for yourself to be your people forever; and you, O LORD, became their God.
10誌馬 7:25 And now, O LORD God, as for the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, confirm it forever; do as you have promised.
10誌馬 7:26 Thus your name will be magnified forever in the saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel'; and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
10誌馬 7:27 For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house'; therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
10誌馬 7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant;
10誌馬 7:29 now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you; for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever."
10誌馬 8:1 Some time afterward, David attacked the Philistines and subdued them; David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
10誌馬 8:2 He also defeated the Moabites and, making them lie down on the ground, measured them off with a cord; he measured two lengths of cord for those who were to be put to death, and one length for those who were to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
10誌馬 8:3 David also struck down King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah, as he went to restore his monument at the river Euphrates.
10誌馬 8:4 David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for a hundred chariots.
10誌馬 8:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of the Arameans.
10誌馬 8:6 Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David and brought tribute. The LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
10誌馬 8:7 David took the gold shields that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 8:8 From Betah and from Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great amount of bronze.
10誌馬 8:9 When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer,
10誌馬 8:10 Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to greet him and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him. Now Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze;
10誌馬 8:11 these also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he subdued,
10誌馬 8:12 from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah.
10誌馬 8:13 David won a name for himself. When he returned, he killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
10誌馬 8:14 He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
10誌馬 8:15 So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and equity to all his people.
10誌馬 8:16 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
10誌馬 8:17 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary;
10誌馬 8:18 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were priests.
10誌馬 9:1 David asked, "Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
10誌馬 9:2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and he was summoned to David. The king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "At your service!"
10誌馬 9:3 The king said, "Is there anyone remaining of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?" Ziba said to the king, "There remains a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet."
10誌馬 9:4 The king said to him, "Where is he?" Ziba said to the king, "He is in the house of Machir son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar."
10誌馬 9:5 Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
10誌馬 9:6 Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul came to David, and fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, "Mephibosheth!" He answered, "I am your servant."
10誌馬 9:7 David said to him, "Do not be afraid, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan; I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you yourself shall eat at my table always."
10誌馬 9:8 He did obeisance and said, "What is your servant, that you should look upon a dead dog such as I?"
10誌馬 9:9 Then the king summoned Saul's servant Ziba, and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson.
10誌馬 9:10 You and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him, and shall bring in the produce, so that your master's grandson may have food to eat; but your master's grandson Mephibosheth shall always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
10誌馬 9:11 Then Ziba said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do." Mephibosheth ate at David's table, like one of the king's sons.
10誌馬 9:12 Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants.
10誌馬 9:13 Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the king's table. Now he was lame in both his feet.
10誌馬 10:1 Some time afterward, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him.
10誌馬 10:2 David said, "I will deal loyally with Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father dealt loyally with me." So David sent envoys to console him concerning his father. When David's envoys came into the land of the Ammonites,
10誌馬 10:3 the princes of the Ammonites said to their lord Hanun, "Do you really think that David is honoring your father just because he has sent messengers with condolences to you? Has not David sent his envoys to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
10誌馬 10:4 So Hanun seized David's envoys, shaved off half the beard of each, cut off their garments in the middle at their hips, and sent them away.
10誌馬 10:5 When David was told, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."
10誌馬 10:6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, as well as the king of Maacah, one thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men.
10誌馬 10:7 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army with the warriors.
10誌馬 10:8 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate; but the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the open country.
10誌馬 10:9 When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Arameans;
10誌馬 10:10 the rest of his men he put in the charge of his brother Abishai, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
10誌馬 10:11 He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
10誌馬 10:12 Be strong, and let us be courageous for the sake of our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what seems good to him."
10誌馬 10:13 So Joab and the people who were with him moved forward into battle against the Arameans; and they fled before him.
10誌馬 10:14 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites, and came to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 10:15 But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
10誌馬 10:16 Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates; and they came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
10誌馬 10:17 When it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Arameans arrayed themselves against David and fought with him.
10誌馬 10:18 The Arameans fled before Israel; and David killed of the Arameans seven hundred chariot teams, and forty thousand horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
10誌馬 10:19 When all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel, and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.
10誌馬 11:1 In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
10誌馬 11:2 It happened, late one afternoon, when David rose from his couch and was walking about on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; the woman was very beautiful.
10誌馬 11:3 David sent someone to inquire about the woman. It was reported, "This is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite."
10誌馬 11:4 So David sent messengers to get her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself after her period.) Then she returned to her house.
10誌馬 11:5 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, "I am pregnant."
10誌馬 11:6 So David sent word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David.
10誌馬 11:7 When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the people fared, and how the war was going.
10誌馬 11:8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.
10誌馬 11:9 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
10誌馬 11:10 When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "You have just come from a journey. Why did you not go down to your house?"
10誌馬 11:11 Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah remain in booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing."
10誌馬 11:12 Then David said to Uriah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day. On the next day,
10誌馬 11:13 David invited him to eat and drink in his presence and made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
10誌馬 11:14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
10誌馬 11:15 In the letter he wrote, "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, so that he may be struck down and die."
10誌馬 11:16 As Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant warriors.
10誌馬 11:17 The men of the city came out and fought with Joab; and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite was killed as well.
10誌馬 11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting;
10誌馬 11:19 and he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling the king all the news about the fighting,
10誌馬 11:20 then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
10誌馬 11:21 Who killed Abimelech son of Jerubbaal? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead too.'"
10誌馬 11:22 So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
10誌馬 11:23 The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us, and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
10誌馬 11:24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the king's servants are dead; and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10誌馬 11:25 David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another; press your attack on the city, and overthrow it.' And encourage him."
10誌馬 11:26 When the wife of Uriah heard that her husband was dead, she made lamentation for him.
10誌馬 11:27 When the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD,
10誌馬 12:1 and the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
10誌馬 12:2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds;
10誌馬 12:3 but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. He brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his meager fare, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him.
10誌馬 12:4 Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was loath to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb, and prepared that for the guest who had come to him."
10誌馬 12:5 Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man. He said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die;
10誌馬 12:6 he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
10誌馬 12:7 Nathan said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul;
10誌馬 12:8 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added as much more.
10誌馬 12:9 Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
10誌馬 12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, for you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
10誌馬 12:11 Thus says the LORD: I will raise up trouble against you from within your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this very sun.
10誌馬 12:12 For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."
10誌馬 12:13 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan said to David, "Now the LORD has put away your sin; you shall not die.
10誌馬 12:14 Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child that is born to you shall die."
10誌馬 12:15 Then Nathan went to his house. The LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it became very ill.
10誌馬 12:16 David therefore pleaded with God for the child; David fasted, and went in and lay all night on the ground.
10誌馬 12:17 The elders of his house stood beside him, urging him to rise from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
10誌馬 12:18 On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, "While the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we tell him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm."
10誌馬 12:19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, he perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."
10誌馬 12:20 Then David rose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He went into the house of the LORD, and worshiped; he then went to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him and he ate.
10誌馬 12:21 Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you rose and ate food."
10誌馬 12:22 He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me, and the child may live.'
10誌馬 12:23 But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
10誌馬 12:24 Then David consoled his wife Bathsheba, and went to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he named him Solomon. The LORD loved him,
10誌馬 12:25 and sent a message by the prophet Nathan; so he named him Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
10誌馬 12:26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and took the royal city.
10誌馬 12:27 Joab sent messengers to David, and said, "I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the water city.
10誌馬 12:28 Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; or I myself will take the city, and it will be called by my name."
10誌馬 12:29 So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.
10誌馬 12:30 He took the crown of Milcom from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. He also brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
10誌馬 12:31 He brought out the people who were in it, and set them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes, or sent them to the brickworks. Thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 13:1 Some time passed. David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar; and David's son Amnon fell in love with her.
10誌馬 13:2 Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
10誌馬 13:3 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah; and Jonadab was a very crafty man.
10誌馬 13:4 He said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
10誌馬 13:5 Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be ill; and when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, so that I may see it and eat it from her hand.'"
10誌馬 13:6 So Amnon lay down, and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand."
10誌馬 13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."
10誌馬 13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
10誌馬 13:9 Then she took the pan and set them out before him, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, "Send out everyone from me." So everyone went out from him.
10誌馬 13:10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber, so that I may eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
10誌馬 13:11 But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."
10誌馬 13:12 She answered him, "No, my brother, do not force me; for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do anything so vile!
10誌馬 13:13 As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the scoundrels in Israel. Now therefore, I beg you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you."
10誌馬 13:14 But he would not listen to her; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.
10誌馬 13:15 Then Amnon was seized with a very great loathing for her; indeed, his loathing was even greater than the lust he had felt for her. Amnon said to her, "Get out!"
10誌馬 13:16 But she said to him, "No, my brother; for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me." But he would not listen to her.
10誌馬 13:17 He called the young man who served him and said, "Put this woman out of my presence, and bolt the door after her."
10誌馬 13:18 (Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves; for this is how the virgin daughters of the king were clothed in earlier times.) So his servant put her out, and bolted the door after her.
10誌馬 13:19 But Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore the long robe that she was wearing; she put her hand on her head, and went away, crying aloud as she went.
10誌馬 13:20 Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother; do not take this to heart." So Tamar remained, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.
10誌馬 13:21 When King David heard of all these things, he became very angry, but he would not punish his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn.
10誌馬 13:22 But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had raped his sister Tamar.
10誌馬 13:23 After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
10誌馬 13:24 Absalom came to the king, and said, "Your servant has sheepshearers; will the king and his servants please go with your servant?"
10誌馬 13:25 But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son, let us not all go, or else we will be burdensome to you." He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
10誌馬 13:26 Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." The king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"
10誌馬 13:27 But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. Absalom made a feast like a king's feast.
10誌馬 13:28 Then Absalom commanded his servants, "Watch when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid; have I not myself commanded you? Be courageous and valiant."
10誌馬 13:29 So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons rose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
10誌馬 13:30 While they were on the way, the report came to David that Absalom had killed all the king's sons, and not one of them was left.
10誌馬 13:31 The king rose, tore his garments, and lay on the ground; and all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.
10誌馬 13:32 But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, "Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; Amnon alone is dead. This has been determined by Absalom from the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
10誌馬 13:33 Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take it to heart, as if all the king's sons were dead; for Amnon alone is dead."
10誌馬 13:34 But Absalom fled. When the young man who kept watch looked up, he saw many people coming from the Horonaim road by the side of the mountain.
10誌馬 13:35 Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about."
10誌馬 13:36 As soon as he had finished speaking, the king's sons arrived, and raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.
10誌馬 13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son day after day.
10誌馬 13:38 Absalom, having fled to Geshur, stayed there three years.
10誌馬 13:39 And the heart of the king went out, yearning for Absalom; for he was now consoled over the death of Amnon.
10誌馬 14:1 Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's mind was on Absalom.
10誌馬 14:2 Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He said to her, "Pretend to be a mourner; put on mourning garments, do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
10誌馬 14:3 Go to the king and speak to him as follows." And Joab put the words into her mouth.
10誌馬 14:4 When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance, and said, "Help, O king!"
10誌馬 14:5 The king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
10誌馬 14:6 Your servant had two sons, and they fought with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him.
10誌馬 14:7 Now the whole family has risen against your servant. They say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother, so that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he murdered, even if we destroy the heir as well.' Thus they would quench my one remaining ember, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth."
10誌馬 14:8 Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."
10誌馬 14:9 The woman of Tekoa said to the king, "On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless."
10誌馬 14:10 The king said, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again."
10誌馬 14:11 Then she said, "Please, may the king keep the LORD your God in mind, so that the avenger of blood may kill no more, and my son not be destroyed." He said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."
10誌馬 14:12 Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." He said, "Speak."
10誌馬 14:13 The woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.
10誌馬 14:14 We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up. But God will not take away a life; he will devise plans so as not to keep an outcast banished forever from his presence.
10誌馬 14:15 Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid; your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
10誌馬 14:16 For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would cut both me and my son off from the heritage of God.'
10誌馬 14:17 Your servant thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest'; for my lord the king is like the angel of God, discerning good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!"
10誌馬 14:18 Then the king answered the woman, "Do not withhold from me anything I ask you." The woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."
10誌馬 14:19 The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn right or left from anything that my lord the king has said. For it was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.
10誌馬 14:20 In order to change the course of affairs your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth."
10誌馬 14:21 Then the king said to Joab, "Very well, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom."
10誌馬 14:22 Joab prostrated himself with his face to the ground and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant."
10誌馬 14:23 So Joab set off, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 14:24 The king said, "Let him go to his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Absalom went to his own house, and did not come into the king's presence.
10誌馬 14:25 Now in all Israel there was no one to be praised so much for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
10誌馬 14:26 When he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
10誌馬 14:27 There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.
10誌馬 14:28 So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence.
10誌馬 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king; but Joab would not come to him. He sent a second time, but Joab would not come.
10誌馬 14:30 Then he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
10誌馬 14:31 Then Joab rose and went to Absalom at his house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
10誌馬 14:32 Absalom answered Joab, "Look, I sent word to you: Come here, that I may send you to the king with the question, 'Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.' Now let me go into the king's presence; if there is guilt in me, let him kill me!"
10誌馬 14:33 Then Joab went to the king and told him; and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
10誌馬 15:1 After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him.
10誌馬 15:2 Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road into the gate; and when anyone brought a suit before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out and say, "From what city are you?" When the person said, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,"
10誌馬 15:3 Absalom would say, "See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you."
10誌馬 15:4 Absalom said moreover, "If only I were judge in the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice."
10誌馬 15:5 Whenever people came near to do obeisance to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of them, and kiss them.
10誌馬 15:6 Thus Absalom did to every Israelite who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
10誌馬 15:7 At the end of four years Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go to Hebron and pay the vow that I have made to the LORD.
10誌馬 15:8 For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram: If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will worship the LORD in Hebron."
10誌馬 15:9 The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he got up, and went to Hebron.
10誌馬 15:10 But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then shout: Absalom has become king at Hebron!"
10誌馬 15:11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom; they were invited guests, and they went in their innocence, knowing nothing of the matter.
10誌馬 15:12 While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. The conspiracy grew in strength, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.
10誌馬 15:13 A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the Israelites have gone after Absalom."
10誌馬 15:14 Then David said to all his officials who were with him at Jerusalem, "Get up! Let us flee, or there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry, or he will soon overtake us, and bring disaster down upon us, and attack the city with the edge of the sword."
10誌馬 15:15 The king's officials said to the king, "Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king decides."
10誌馬 15:16 So the king left, followed by all his household, except ten concubines whom he left behind to look after the house.
10誌馬 15:17 The king left, followed by all the people; and they stopped at the last house.
10誌馬 15:18 All his officials passed by him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.
10誌馬 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why are you also coming with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your home.
10誌馬 15:20 You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your kinsfolk with you; and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you."
10誌馬 15:21 But Ittai answered the king, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be."
10誌馬 15:22 David said to Ittai, "Go then, march on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
10誌馬 15:23 The whole country wept aloud as all the people passed by; the king crossed the Wadi Kidron, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.
10誌馬 15:24 Abiathar came up, and Zadok also, with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city.
10誌馬 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and the place where it stays.
10誌馬 15:26 But if he says, 'I take no pleasure in you,' here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him."
10誌馬 15:27 The king also said to the priest Zadok, "Look, go back to the city in peace, you and Abiathar, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar.
10誌馬 15:28 See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
10誌馬 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
10誌馬 15:30 But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot; and all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.
10誌馬 15:31 David was told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, "O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
10誌馬 15:32 When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head.
10誌馬 15:33 David said to him, "If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
10誌馬 15:34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
10誌馬 15:35 The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar.
10誌馬 15:36 Their two sons are with them there, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan; and by them you shall report to me everything you hear."
10誌馬 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
10誌馬 16:1 When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, carrying two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred bunches of raisins, one hundred of summer fruits, and one skin of wine.
10誌馬 16:2 The king said to Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who faint in the wilderness."
10誌馬 16:3 The king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to the king, "He remains in Jerusalem; for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"
10誌馬 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." Ziba said, "I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord the king."
10誌馬 16:5 When King David came to Bahurim, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out whose name was Shimei son of Gera; he came out cursing.
10誌馬 16:6 He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; now all the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left.
10誌馬 16:7 Shimei shouted while he cursed, "Out! Out! Murderer! Scoundrel!
10誌馬 16:8 The LORD has avenged on all of you the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, disaster has overtaken you; for you are a man of blood."
10誌馬 16:9 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."
10誌馬 16:10 But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David,' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
10誌馬 16:11 David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "My own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.
10誌馬 16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on my distress, and the LORD will repay me with good for this cursing of me today."
10誌馬 16:13 So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, throwing stones and flinging dust at him.
10誌馬 16:14 The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary at the Jordan; and there he refreshed himself.
10誌馬 16:15 Now Absalom and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem; Ahithophel was with him.
10誌馬 16:16 When Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
10誌馬 16:17 Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
10誌馬 16:18 Hushai said to Absalom, "No; but the one whom the LORD and this people and all the Israelites have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.
10誌馬 16:19 Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I have served your father, so I will serve you."
10誌馬 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your counsel; what shall we do?"
10誌馬 16:21 Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, the ones he has left to look after the house; and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."
10誌馬 16:22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
10誌馬 16:23 Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the oracle of God; so all the counsel of Ahithophel was esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.
10誌馬 17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight.
10誌馬 17:2 I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged, and throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king,
10誌馬 17:3 and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace."
10誌馬 17:4 The advice pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
10誌馬 17:5 Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear too what he has to say."
10誌馬 17:6 When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, "This is what Ahithophel has said; shall we do as he advises? If not, you tell us."
10誌馬 17:7 Then Hushai said to Absalom, "This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good."
10誌馬 17:8 Hushai continued, "You know that your father and his men are warriors, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the troops.
10誌馬 17:9 Even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits, or in some other place. And when some of our troops fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.'
10誌馬 17:10 Then even the valiant warrior, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear; for all Israel knows that your father is a warrior, and that those who are with him are valiant warriors.
10誌馬 17:11 But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, like the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.
10誌馬 17:12 So we shall come upon him in whatever place he may be found, and we shall light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and he will not survive, nor will any of those with him.
10誌馬 17:13 If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there."
10誌馬 17:14 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring ruin on Absalom.
10誌馬 17:15 Then Hushai said to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, "Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and so I have counseled.
10誌馬 17:16 Therefore send quickly and tell David, 'Do not lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over; otherwise the king and all the people who are with him will be swallowed up.'"
10誌馬 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel; a servant girl used to go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David; for they could not risk being seen entering the city.
10誌馬 17:18 But a boy saw them, and told Absalom; so both of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard; and they went down into it.
10誌馬 17:19 The man's wife took a covering, stretched it over the well's mouth, and spread out grain on it; and nothing was known of it.
10誌馬 17:20 When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman said to them, "They have crossed over the brook of water." And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 17:21 After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, "Go and cross the water quickly; for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you."
10誌馬 17:22 So David and all the people who were with him set out and crossed the Jordan; by daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
10誌馬 17:23 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order, and hanged himself; he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.
10誌馬 17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim, while Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
10誌馬 17:25 Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army in the place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
10誌馬 17:26 The Israelites and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
10誌馬 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
10誌馬 17:28 brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans and lentils,
10誌馬 17:29 honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat; for they said, "The troops are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness."
10誌馬 18:1 Then David mustered the men who were with him, and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
10誌馬 18:2 And David divided the army into three groups: one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the men, "I myself will also go out with you."
10誌馬 18:3 But the men said, "You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore it is better that you send us help from the city."
10誌馬 18:4 The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
10誌馬 18:5 The king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders concerning Absalom.
10誌馬 18:6 So the army went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
10誌馬 18:7 The men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the slaughter there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.
10誌馬 18:8 The battle spread over the face of all the country; and the forest claimed more victims that day than the sword.
10誌馬 18:9 Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. His head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.
10誌馬 18:10 A man saw it, and told Joab, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
10誌馬 18:11 Joab said to the man who told him, "What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt."
10誌馬 18:12 But the man said to Joab, "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not raise my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying: For my sake protect the young man Absalom!
10誌馬 18:13 On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof."
10誌馬 18:14 Joab said, "I will not waste time like this with you." He took three spears in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, while he was still alive in the oak.
10誌馬 18:15 And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him, and killed him.
10誌馬 18:16 Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the troops.
10誌馬 18:17 They took Absalom, threw him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Meanwhile all the Israelites fled to their homes.
10誌馬 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar that is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance"; he called the pillar by his own name. It is called Absalom's Monument to this day.
10誌馬 18:19 Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run, and carry tidings to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the power of his enemies."
10誌馬 18:20 Joab said to him, "You are not to carry tidings today; you may carry tidings another day, but today you shall not do so, because the king's son is dead."
10誌馬 18:21 Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran.
10誌馬 18:22 Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said again to Joab, "Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why will you run, my son, seeing that you have no reward for the tidings?"
10誌馬 18:23 "Come what may," he said, "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
10誌馬 18:24 Now David was sitting between the two gates. The sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he looked up, he saw a man running alone.
10誌馬 18:25 The sentinel shouted and told the king. The king said, "If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth." He kept coming, and drew near.
10誌馬 18:26 Then the sentinel saw another man running; and the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, "See, another man running alone!" The king said, "He also is bringing tidings."
10誌馬 18:27 The sentinel said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok." The king said, "He is a good man, and comes with good tidings."
10誌馬 18:28 Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, "All is well!" He prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground, and said, "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king."
10誌馬 18:29 The king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was."
10誌馬 18:30 The king said, "Turn aside, and stand here." So he turned aside, and stood still.
10誌馬 18:31 Then the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, "Good tidings for my lord the king! For the LORD has vindicated you this day, delivering you from the power of all who rose up against you."
10誌馬 18:32 The king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" The Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up to do you harm, be like that young man."
10誌馬 18:33 The king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10誌馬 19:1 It was told Joab, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."
10誌馬 19:2 So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the troops; for the troops heard that day, "The king is grieving for his son."
10誌馬 19:3 The troops stole into the city that day as soldiers steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle.
10誌馬 19:4 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10誌馬 19:5 Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, "Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your officers who have saved your life today, and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and your concubines,
10誌馬 19:6 for love of those who hate you and for hatred of those who love you. You have made it clear today that commanders and officers are nothing to you; for I perceive that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.
10誌馬 19:7 So go out at once and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night; and this will be worse for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your youth until now."
10誌馬 19:8 Then the king got up and took his seat in the gate. The troops were all told, "See, the king is sitting in the gate"; and all the troops came before the king. Meanwhile, all the Israelites had fled to their homes.
10誌馬 19:9 All the people were disputing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and saved us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.
10誌馬 19:10 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
10誌馬 19:11 King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, "Say to the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king.
10誌馬 19:12 You are my kin, you are my bone and my flesh; why then should you be the last to bring back the king?'
10誌馬 19:13 And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? So may God do to me, and more, if you are not the commander of my army from now on, in place of Joab.'"
10誌馬 19:14 Amasa swayed the hearts of all the people of Judah as one, and they sent word to the king, "Return, both you and all your servants."
10誌馬 19:15 So the king came back to the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring him over the Jordan.
10誌馬 19:16 Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the people of Judah to meet King David;
10誌馬 19:17 with him were a thousand people from Benjamin. And Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king,
10誌馬 19:18 while the crossing was taking place, to bring over the king's household, and to do his pleasure. Shimei son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan,
10誌馬 19:19 and said to the king, "May my lord not hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem; may the king not bear it in mind.
10誌馬 19:20 For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, see, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."
10誌馬 19:21 Abishai son of Zeruiah answered, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
10誌馬 19:22 But David said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today become an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?"
10誌馬 19:23 The king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king gave him his oath.
10誌馬 19:24 Mephibosheth grandson of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes, from the day the king left until the day he came back in safety.
10誌馬 19:25 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
10誌馬 19:26 He answered, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said to him, 'Saddle a donkey for me, so that I may ride on it and go with the king.' For your servant is lame.
10誌馬 19:27 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.
10誌馬 19:28 For all my father's house were doomed to death before my lord the king; but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to appeal to the king?"
10誌馬 19:29 The king said to him, "Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land."
10誌馬 19:30 Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take it all, since my lord the king has arrived home safely."
10誌馬 19:31 Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.
10誌馬 19:32 Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
10誌馬 19:33 The king said to Barzillai, "Come over with me, and I will provide for you in Jerusalem at my side."
10誌馬 19:34 But Barzillai said to the king, "How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
10誌馬 19:35 Today I am eighty years old; can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
10誌馬 19:36 Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king recompense me with such a reward?
10誌馬 19:37 Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own town, near the graves of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do for him whatever seems good to you."
10誌馬 19:38 The king answered, "Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you; and all that you desire of me I will do for you."
10誌馬 19:39 Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed over; the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.
10誌馬 19:40 The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; all the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
10誌馬 19:41 Then all the people of Israel came to the king, and said to him, "Why have our kindred the people of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"
10誌馬 19:42 All the people of Judah answered the people of Israel, "Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?"
10誌馬 19:43 But the people of Israel answered the people of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the words of the people of Judah were fiercer than the words of the people of Israel.
10誌馬 20:1 Now a scoundrel named Sheba son of Bichri, a Benjaminite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and cried out, "We have no portion in David, no share in the son of Jesse! Everyone to your tents, O Israel!"
10誌馬 20:2 So all the people of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba son of Bichri; but the people of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 20:3 David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and put them in a house under guard, and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.
10誌馬 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself."
10誌馬 20:5 So Amasa went to summon Judah; but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him.
10誌馬 20:6 David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities for himself, and escape from us."
10誌馬 20:7 Joab's men went out after him, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:8 When they were at the large stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier's garment and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist; as he went forward it fell out.
10誌馬 20:9 Joab said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10誌馬 20:10 But Amasa did not notice the sword in Joab's hand; Joab struck him in the belly so that his entrails poured out on the ground, and he died. He did not strike a second blow. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:11 And one of Joab's men took his stand by Amasa, and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab."
10誌馬 20:12 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood on the highway, and the man saw that all the people were stopping. Since he saw that all who came by him were stopping, he carried Amasa from the highway into a field, and threw a garment over him.
10誌馬 20:13 Once he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites assembled, and followed him inside.
10誌馬 20:15 Joab's forces came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah; they threw up a siege-ramp against the city, and it stood against the rampart. Joab's forces were battering the wall to break it down.
10誌馬 20:16 Then a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, 'Come here, I want to speak to you.'"
10誌馬 20:17 He came near her; and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" He answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." He answered, "I am listening."
10誌馬 20:18 Then she said, "They used to say in the old days, 'Let them inquire at Abel'; and so they would settle a matter.
10誌馬 20:19 I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel; you seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel; why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?"
10誌馬 20:20 Joab answered, "Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy!
10誌馬 20:21 That is not the case! But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David; give him up alone, and I will withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head shall be thrown over the wall to you."
10誌馬 20:22 Then the woman went to all the people with her wise plan. And they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, and all went to their homes, while Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
10誌馬 20:23 Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
10誌馬 20:24 Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
10誌馬 20:25 Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
10誌馬 20:26 and Ira the Jairite was also David's priest.
10誌馬 21:1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. The LORD said, "There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death."
10誌馬 21:2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the people of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; although the people of Israel had sworn to spare them, Saul had tried to wipe them out in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.)
10誌馬 21:3 David said to the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make expiation, that you may bless the heritage of the LORD?"
10誌馬 21:4 The Gibeonites said to him, "It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put anyone to death in Israel." He said, "What do you say that I should do for you?"
10誌馬 21:5 They said to the king, "The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel--
10誌馬 21:6 let seven of his sons be handed over to us, and we will impale them before the LORD at Gibeon on the mountain of the LORD." The king said, "I will hand them over."
10誌馬 21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
10誌馬 21:8 The king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
10誌馬 21:9 he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they impaled them on the mountain before the LORD. The seven of them perished together. They were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest.
10誌馬 21:10 Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it on a rock for herself, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell on them from the heavens; she did not allow the birds of the air to come on the bodies by day, or the wild animals by night.
10誌馬 21:11 When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
10誌馬 21:12 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the people of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.
10誌馬 21:13 He brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who had been impaled.
10誌馬 21:14 They buried the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of his father Kish; they did all that the king commanded. After that, God heeded supplications for the land.
10誌馬 21:15 The Philistines went to war again with Israel, and David went down together with his servants. They fought against the Philistines, and David grew weary.
10誌馬 21:16 Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze, and who was fitted out with new weapons, said he would kill David.
10誌馬 21:17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, "You shall not go out with us to battle any longer, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel."
10誌馬 21:18 After this a battle took place with the Philistines, at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants.
10誌馬 21:19 Then there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
10誌馬 21:20 There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great size, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; he too was descended from the giants.
10誌馬 21:21 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David's brother Shimei, killed him.
10誌馬 21:22 These four were descended from the giants in Gath; they fell by the hands of David and his servants.
10誌馬 22:1 David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
10誌馬 22:2 He said: The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
10誌馬 22:3 my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
10誌馬 22:4 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
10誌馬 22:5 For the waves of death encompassed me, the torrents of perdition assailed me;
10誌馬 22:6 the cords of Sheol entangled me, the snares of death confronted me.
10誌馬 22:7 In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I called. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry came to his ears.
10誌馬 22:8 Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
10誌馬 22:9 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
10誌馬 22:10 He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
10誌馬 22:11 He rode on a cherub, and flew; he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
10誌馬 22:12 He made darkness around him a canopy, thick clouds, a gathering of water.
10誌馬 22:13 Out of the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth.
10誌馬 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven; the Most High uttered his voice.
10誌馬 22:15 He sent out arrows, and scattered them--lightning, and routed them.
10誌馬 22:16 Then the channels of the sea were seen, the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
10誌馬 22:17 He reached from on high, he took me, he drew me out of mighty waters.
10誌馬 22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
10誌馬 22:19 They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my stay.
10誌馬 22:20 He brought me out into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
10誌馬 22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
10誌馬 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
10誌馬 22:23 For all his ordinances were before me, and from his statutes I did not turn aside.
10誌馬 22:24 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
10誌馬 22:25 Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.
10誌馬 22:26 With the loyal you show yourself loyal; with the blameless you show yourself blameless;
10誌馬 22:27 with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself perverse.
10誌馬 22:28 You deliver a humble people, but your eyes are upon the haughty to bring them down.
10誌馬 22:29 Indeed, you are my lamp, O LORD, the LORD lightens my darkness.
10誌馬 22:30 By you I can crush a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
10誌馬 22:31 This God--his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
10誌馬 22:32 For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?
10誌馬 22:33 The God who has girded me with strength has opened wide my path.
10誌馬 22:34 He made my feet like the feet of deer, and set me secure on the heights.
10誌馬 22:35 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
10誌馬 22:36 You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your help has made me great.
10誌馬 22:37 You have made me stride freely, and my feet do not slip;
10誌馬 22:38 I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.
10誌馬 22:39 I consumed them; I struck them down, so that they did not rise; they fell under my feet.
10誌馬 22:40 For you girded me with strength for the battle; you made my assailants sink under me.
10誌馬 22:41 You made my enemies turn their backs to me, those who hated me, and I destroyed them.
10誌馬 22:42 They looked, but there was no one to save them; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
10誌馬 22:43 I beat them fine like the dust of the earth, I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.
10誌馬 22:44 You delivered me from strife with the peoples; you kept me as the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
10誌馬 22:45 Foreigners came cringing to me; as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.
10誌馬 22:46 Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their strongholds.
10誌馬 22:47 The LORD lives! Blessed be my rock, and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation,
10誌馬 22:48 the God who gave me vengeance and brought down peoples under me,
10誌馬 22:49 who brought me out from my enemies; you exalted me above my adversaries, you delivered me from the violent.
10誌馬 22:50 For this I will extol you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.
10誌馬 22:51 He is a tower of salvation for his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
10誌馬 23:1 Now these are the last words of David: The oracle of David, son of Jesse, the oracle of the man whom God exalted, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the favorite of the Strong One of Israel:
10誌馬 23:2 The spirit of the LORD speaks through me, his word is upon my tongue.
10誌馬 23:3 The God of Israel has spoken, the Rock of Israel has said to me: One who rules over people justly, ruling in the fear of God,
10誌馬 23:4 is like the light of morning, like the sun rising on a cloudless morning, gleaming from the rain on the grassy land.
10誌馬 23:5 Is not my house like this with God? For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. Will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?
10誌馬 23:6 But the godless are all like thorns that are thrown away; for they cannot be picked up with the hand;
10誌馬 23:7 to touch them one uses an iron bar or the shaft of a spear. And they are entirely consumed in fire on the spot.
10誌馬 23:8 These are the names of the warriors whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the Three; he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
10誌馬 23:9 Next to him among the three warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew,
10誌馬 23:10 but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. Then the people came back to him--but only to strip the dead.
10誌馬 23:11 Next to him was Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines.
10誌馬 23:12 But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory.
10誌馬 23:13 Towards the beginning of harvest three of the thirty chiefs went down to join David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 23:14 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
10誌馬 23:15 David said longingly, "O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
10誌馬 23:16 Then the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,
10誌馬 23:17 for he said, "The LORD forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. The three warriors did these things.
10誌馬 23:18 Now Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Thirty. With his spear he fought against three hundred men and killed them, and won a name beside the Three.
10誌馬 23:19 He was the most renowned of the Thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the Three.
10誌馬 23:20 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant warrior from Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
10誌馬 23:21 And he killed an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but Benaiah went against him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
10誌馬 23:22 Such were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and won a name beside the three warriors.
10誌馬 23:23 He was renowned among the Thirty, but he did not attain to the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
10誌馬 23:24 Among the Thirty were Asahel brother of Joab; Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem;
10誌馬 23:25 Shammah of Harod; Elika of Harod;
10誌馬 23:26 Helez the Paltite; Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa;
10誌馬 23:27 Abiezer of Anathoth; Mebunnai the Hushathite;
10誌馬 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite; Maharai of Netophah;
10誌馬 23:29 Heleb son of Baanah of Netophah; Ittai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites;
10誌馬 23:30 Benaiah of Pirathon; Hiddai of the torrents of Gaash;
10誌馬 23:31 Abi-albon the Arbathite; Azmaveth of Bahurim;
10誌馬 23:32 Eliahba of Shaalbon; the sons of Jashen: Jonathan
10誌馬 23:33 son of Shammah the Hararite; Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite;
10誌馬 23:34 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai of Maacah; Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite;
10誌馬 23:35 Hezro of Carmel; Paarai the Arbite;
10誌馬 23:36 Igal son of Nathan of Zobah; Bani the Gadite;
10誌馬 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah;
10誌馬 23:38 Ira the Ithrite; Gareb the Ithrite;
10誌馬 23:39 Uriah the Hittite--thirty-seven in all.
10誌馬 24:1 Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go, count the people of Israel and Judah."
10誌馬 24:2 So the king said to Joab and the commanders of the army, who were with him, "Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and take a census of the people, so that I may know how many there are."
10誌馬 24:3 But Joab said to the king, "May the LORD your God increase the number of the people a hundredfold, while the eyes of my lord the king can still see it! But why does my lord the king want to do this?"
10誌馬 24:4 But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to take a census of the people of Israel.
10誌馬 24:5 They crossed the Jordan, and began from Aroer and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.
10誌馬 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they went around to Sidon,
10誌馬 24:7 and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beer-sheba.
10誌馬 24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
10誌馬 24:9 Joab reported to the king the number of those who had been recorded: in Israel there were eight hundred thousand soldiers able to draw the sword, and those of Judah were five hundred thousand.
10誌馬 24:10 But afterward, David was stricken to the heart because he had numbered the people. David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, I pray you, take away the guilt of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
10誌馬 24:11 When David rose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
10誌馬 24:12 "Go and say to David: Thus says the LORD: Three things I offer you; choose one of them, and I will do it to you."
10誌馬 24:13 So Gad came to David and told him; he asked him, "Shall three years of famine come to you on your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to the one who sent me."
10誌馬 24:14 Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into human hands."
10誌馬 24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from that morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand of the people died, from Dan to Beer-sheba.
10誌馬 24:16 But when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented concerning the evil, and said to the angel who was bringing destruction among the people, "It is enough; now stay your hand." The angel of the LORD was then by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
10誌馬 24:17 When David saw the angel who was destroying the people, he said to the LORD, "I alone have sinned, and I alone have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father's house."
10誌馬 24:18 That day Gad came to David and said to him, "Go up and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10誌馬 24:19 Following Gad's instructions, David went up, as the LORD had commanded.
10誌馬 24:20 When Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming toward him; and Araunah went out and prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.
10誌馬 24:21 Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be averted from the people."
10誌馬 24:22 Then Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him; here are the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
10誌馬 24:23 All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God respond favorably to you."
10誌馬 24:24 But the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will buy them from you for a price; I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
10誌馬 24:25 David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being. So the LORD answered his supplication for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.
