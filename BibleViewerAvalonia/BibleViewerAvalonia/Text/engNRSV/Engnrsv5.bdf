24Jr 1:1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
24Jr 1:2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
24Jr 1:3 It came also in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
24Jr 1:4 Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
24Jr 1:5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."
24Jr 1:6 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy."
24Jr 1:7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a boy'; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you,
24Jr 1:8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD."
24Jr 1:9 Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me, "Now I have put my words in your mouth.
24Jr 1:10 See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."
24Jr 1:11 The word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree."
24Jr 1:12 Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."
24Jr 1:13 The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, tilted away from the north."
24Jr 1:14 Then the LORD said to me: Out of the north disaster shall break out on all the inhabitants of the land.
24Jr 1:15 For now I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD; and they shall come and all of them shall set their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its surrounding walls and against all the cities of Judah.
24Jr 1:16 And I will utter my judgments against them, for all their wickedness in forsaking me; they have made offerings to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
24Jr 1:17 But you, gird up your loins; stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not break down before them, or I will break you before them.
24Jr 1:18 And I for my part have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall, against the whole land--against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land.
24Jr 1:19 They will fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you.
24Jr 2:1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
24Jr 2:2 Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD: I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
24Jr 2:3 Israel was holy to the LORD, the first fruits of his harvest. All who ate of it were held guilty; disaster came upon them, says the LORD.
24Jr 2:4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
24Jr 2:5 Thus says the LORD: What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?
24Jr 2:6 They did not say, "Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?"
24Jr 2:7 I brought you into a plentiful land to eat its fruits and its good things. But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
24Jr 2:8 The priests did not say, "Where is the LORD?" Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit.
24Jr 2:9 Therefore once more I accuse you, says the LORD, and I accuse your children's children.
24Jr 2:10 Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing.
24Jr 2:11 Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit.
24Jr 2:12 Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the LORD,
24Jr 2:13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water.
24Jr 2:14 Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become plunder?
24Jr 2:15 The lions have roared against him, they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.
24Jr 2:16 Moreover, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.
24Jr 2:17 Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, while he led you in the way?
24Jr 2:18 What then do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24Jr 2:19 Your wickedness will punish you, and your apostasies will convict you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.
24Jr 2:20 For long ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds, and you said, "I will not serve!" On every high hill and under every green tree you sprawled and played the whore.
24Jr 2:21 Yet I planted you as a choice vine, from the purest stock. How then did you turn degenerate and become a wild vine?
24Jr 2:22 Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, says the Lord GOD.
24Jr 2:23 How can you say, "I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals"? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done--a restive young camel interlacing her tracks,
24Jr 2:24 a wild ass at home in the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
24Jr 2:25 Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, "It is hopeless, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go."
24Jr 2:26 As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed--they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,
24Jr 2:27 who say to a tree, "You are my father," and to a stone, "You gave me birth." For they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. But in the time of their trouble they say, "Come and save us!"
24Jr 2:28 But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them come, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.
24Jr 2:29 Why do you complain against me? You have all rebelled against me, says the LORD.
24Jr 2:30 In vain I have struck down your children; they accepted no correction. Your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
24Jr 2:31 And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD! Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, "We are free, we will come to you no more"?
24Jr 2:32 Can a girl forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.
24Jr 2:33 How well you direct your course to seek lovers! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.
24Jr 2:34 Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things
24Jr 2:35 you say, "I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me." Now I am bringing you to judgment for saying, "I have not sinned."
24Jr 2:36 How lightly you gad about, changing your ways! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
24Jr 2:37 From there also you will come away with your hands on your head; for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper through them.
24Jr 3:1 If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not such a land be greatly polluted? You have played the whore with many lovers; and would you return to me? says the LORD.
24Jr 3:2 Look up to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? By the waysides you have sat waiting for lovers, like a nomad in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your whoring and wickedness.
24Jr 3:3 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have the forehead of a whore, you refuse to be ashamed.
24Jr 3:4 Have you not just now called to me, "My Father, you are the friend of my youth--
24Jr 3:5 will he be angry forever, will he be indignant to the end?" This is how you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could.
24Jr 3:6 The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and played the whore there?
24Jr 3:7 And I thought, "After she has done all this she will return to me"; but she did not return, and her false sister Judah saw it.
24Jr 3:8 She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce; yet her false sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.
24Jr 3:9 Because she took her whoredom so lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.
24Jr 3:10 Yet for all this her false sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says the LORD.
24Jr 3:11 Then the LORD said to me: Faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty than false Judah.
24Jr 3:12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return, faithless Israel, says the LORD. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, says the LORD; I will not be angry forever.
24Jr 3:13 Only acknowledge your guilt, that you have rebelled against the LORD your God, and scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree, and have not obeyed my voice, says the LORD.
24Jr 3:14 Return, O faithless children, says the LORD, for I am your master; I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
24Jr 3:15 I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
24Jr 3:16 And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall no longer say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind, or be remembered, or missed; nor shall another one be made.
24Jr 3:17 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no longer stubbornly follow their own evil will.
24Jr 3:18 In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your ancestors for a heritage.
24Jr 3:19 I thought how I would set you among my children, and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful heritage of all the nations. And I thought you would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me.
24Jr 3:20 Instead, as a faithless wife leaves her husband, so you have been faithless to me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.
24Jr 3:21 A voice on the bare heights is heard, the plaintive weeping of Israel's children, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the LORD their God:
24Jr 3:22 Return, O faithless children, I will heal your faithlessness. "Here we come to you; for you are the LORD our God.
24Jr 3:23 Truly the hills are a delusion, the orgies on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
24Jr 3:24 "But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our ancestors had labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
24Jr 3:25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our ancestors, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
24Jr 4:1 If you return, O Israel, says the LORD, if you return to me, if you remove your abominations from my presence, and do not waver,
24Jr 4:2 and if you swear, "As the LORD lives!" in truth, in justice, and in uprightness, then nations shall be blessed by him, and by him they shall boast.
24Jr 4:3 For thus says the LORD to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.
24Jr 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, remove the foreskin of your hearts, O people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or else my wrath will go forth like fire, and burn with no one to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
24Jr 4:5 Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: Blow the trumpet through the land; shout aloud and say, "Gather together, and let us go into the fortified cities!"
24Jr 4:6 Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, do not delay, for I am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction.
24Jr 4:7 A lion has gone up from its thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.
24Jr 4:8 Because of this put on sackcloth, lament and wail: "The fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us."
24Jr 4:9 On that day, says the LORD, courage shall fail the king and the officials; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded.
24Jr 4:10 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, how utterly you have deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It shall be well with you,' even while the sword is at the throat!"
24Jr 4:11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A hot wind comes from me out of the bare heights in the desert toward my poor people, not to winnow or cleanse--
24Jr 4:12 a wind too strong for that. Now it is I who speak in judgment against them.
24Jr 4:13 Look! He comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles--woe to us, for we are ruined!
24Jr 4:14 O Jerusalem, wash your heart clean of wickedness so that you may be saved. How long shall your evil schemes lodge within you?
24Jr 4:15 For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims disaster from Mount Ephraim.
24Jr 4:16 Tell the nations, "Here they are!" Proclaim against Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.
24Jr 4:17 They have closed in around her like watchers of a field, because she has rebelled against me, says the LORD.
24Jr 4:18 Your ways and your doings have brought this upon you. This is your doom; how bitter it is! It has reached your very heart."
24Jr 4:19 My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent; for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
24Jr 4:20 Disaster overtakes disaster, the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.
24Jr 4:21 How long must I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
24Jr 4:22 "For my people are foolish, they do not know me; they are stupid children, they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but do not know how to do good."
24Jr 4:23 I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.
24Jr 4:24 I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.
24Jr 4:25 I looked, and lo, there was no one at all, and all the birds of the air had fled.
24Jr 4:26 I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.
24Jr 4:27 For thus says the LORD: The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.
24Jr 4:28 Because of this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above grow black; for I have spoken, I have purposed; I have not relented nor will I turn back.
24Jr 4:29 At the noise of horseman and archer every town takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the towns are forsaken, and no one lives in them.
24Jr 4:30 And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in crimson, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.
24Jr 4:31 For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, anguish as of one bringing forth her first child, the cry of daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before killers!"
24Jr 5:1 Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look around and take note! Search its squares and see if you can find one person who acts justly and seeks truth--so that I may pardon Jerusalem.
24Jr 5:2 Although they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.
24Jr 5:3 O LORD, do your eyes not look for truth? You have struck them, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to turn back.
24Jr 5:4 Then I said, "These are only the poor, they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the law of their God.
24Jr 5:5 Let me go to the rich and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the law of their God." But they all alike had broken the yoke, they had burst the bonds.
24Jr 5:6 Therefore a lion from the forest shall kill them, a wolf from the desert shall destroy them. A leopard is watching against their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces--because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.
24Jr 5:7 How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of prostitutes.
24Jr 5:8 They were well-fed lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor's wife.
24Jr 5:9 Shall I not punish them for these things? says the LORD; and shall I not bring retribution on a nation such as this?
24Jr 5:10 Go up through her vine-rows and destroy, but do not make a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the LORD's.
24Jr 5:11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly faithless to me, says the LORD.
24Jr 5:12 They have spoken falsely of the LORD, and have said, "He will do nothing. No evil will come upon us, and we shall not see sword or famine."
24Jr 5:13 The prophets are nothing but wind, for the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!
24Jr 5:14 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: Because they have spoken this word, I am now making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall devour them.
24Jr 5:15 I am going to bring upon you a nation from far away, O house of Israel, says the LORD. It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
24Jr 5:16 Their quiver is like an open tomb; all of them are mighty warriors.
24Jr 5:17 They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; they shall destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
24Jr 5:18 But even in those days, says the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.
24Jr 5:19 And when your people say, "Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?" you shall say to them, "As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours."
24Jr 5:20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, proclaim it in Judah:
24Jr 5:21 Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but do not see, who have ears, but do not hear.
24Jr 5:22 Do you not fear me? says the LORD; Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail, though they roar, they cannot pass over it.
24Jr 5:23 But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.
24Jr 5:24 They do not say in their hearts, "Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest."
24Jr 5:25 Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have deprived you of good.
24Jr 5:26 For scoundrels are found among my people; they take over the goods of others. Like fowlers they set a trap; they catch human beings.
24Jr 5:27 Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of treachery; therefore they have become great and rich,
24Jr 5:28 they have grown fat and sleek. They know no limits in deeds of wickedness; they do not judge with justice the cause of the orphan, to make it prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
24Jr 5:29 Shall I not punish them for these things? says the LORD, and shall I not bring retribution on a nation such as this?
24Jr 5:30 An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:
24Jr 5:31 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule as the prophets direct; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?
24Jr 6:1 Flee for safety, O children of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looms out of the north, and great destruction.
24Jr 6:2 I have likened daughter Zion to the loveliest pasture.
24Jr 6:3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her. They shall pitch their tents around her; they shall pasture, all in their places.
24Jr 6:4 "Prepare war against her; up, and let us attack at noon!" "Woe to us, for the day declines, the shadows of evening lengthen!"
24Jr 6:5 "Up, and let us attack by night, and destroy her palaces!"
24Jr 6:6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: Cut down her trees; cast up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.
24Jr 6:7 As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her wickedness; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.
24Jr 6:8 Take warning, O Jerusalem, or I shall turn from you in disgust, and make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.
24Jr 6:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer, pass your hand again over its branches.
24Jr 6:10 To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? See, their ears are closed, they cannot listen. The word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.
24Jr 6:11 But I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the gatherings of young men as well; both husband and wife shall be taken, the old folk and the very aged.
24Jr 6:12 Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land, says the LORD.
24Jr 6:13 For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 6:14 They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
24Jr 6:15 They acted shamefully, they committed abomination; yet they were not ashamed, they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the LORD.
24Jr 6:16 Thus says the LORD: Stand at the crossroads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way lies; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, "We will not walk in it."
24Jr 6:17 Also I raised up sentinels for you: "Give heed to the sound of the trumpet!" But they said, "We will not give heed."
24Jr 6:18 Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.
24Jr 6:19 Hear, O earth; I am going to bring disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not given heed to my words; and as for my teaching, they have rejected it.
24Jr 6:20 Of what use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.
24Jr 6:21 Therefore thus says the LORD: See, I am laying before this people stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble; parents and children together, neighbor and friend shall perish.
24Jr 6:22 Thus says the LORD: See, a people is coming from the land of the north, a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
24Jr 6:23 They grasp the bow and the javelin, they are cruel and have no mercy, their sound is like the roaring sea; they ride on horses, equipped like a warrior for battle, against you, O daughter Zion!
24Jr 6:24 "We have heard news of them, our hands fall helpless; anguish has taken hold of us, pain as of a woman in labor.
24Jr 6:25 Do not go out into the field, or walk on the road; for the enemy has a sword, terror is on every side."
24Jr 6:26 O my poor people, put on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only child, most bitter lamentation: for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
24Jr 6:27 I have made you a tester and a refiner among my people so that you may know and test their ways.
24Jr 6:28 They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about with slanders; they are bronze and iron, all of them act corruptly.
24Jr 6:29 The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed.
24Jr 6:30 They are called "rejected silver," for the LORD has rejected them.
24Jr 7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 7:2 Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah, you that enter these gates to worship the LORD.
24Jr 7:3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and let me dwell with you in this place.
24Jr 7:4 Do not trust in these deceptive words: "This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD."
24Jr 7:5 For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another,
24Jr 7:6 if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt,
24Jr 7:7 then I will dwell with you in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your ancestors forever and ever.
24Jr 7:8 Here you are, trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
24Jr 7:9 Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,
24Jr 7:10 and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, "We are safe!"--only to go on doing all these abominations?
24Jr 7:11 Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight? You know, I too am watching, says the LORD.
24Jr 7:12 Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
24Jr 7:13 And now, because you have done all these things, says the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,
24Jr 7:14 therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.
24Jr 7:15 And I will cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your kinsfolk, all the offspring of Ephraim.
24Jr 7:16 As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry or prayer on their behalf, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.
24Jr 7:17 Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 7:18 The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
24Jr 7:19 Is it I whom they provoke? says the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own hurt?
24Jr 7:20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: My anger and my wrath shall be poured out on this place, on human beings and animals, on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched.
24Jr 7:21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.
24Jr 7:22 For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
24Jr 7:23 But this command I gave them, "Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you."
24Jr 7:24 Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but, in the stubbornness of their evil will, they walked in their own counsels, and looked backward rather than forward.
24Jr 7:25 From the day that your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day;
24Jr 7:26 yet they did not listen to me, or pay attention, but they stiffened their necks. They did worse than their ancestors did.
24Jr 7:27 So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
24Jr 7:28 You shall say to them: This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.
24Jr 7:29 Cut off your hair and throw it away; raise a lamentation on the bare heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation that provoked his wrath.
24Jr 7:30 For the people of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the LORD; they have set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, defiling it.
24Jr 7:31 And they go on building the high place of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire--which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.
24Jr 7:32 Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter: for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more room.
24Jr 7:33 The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the animals of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.
24Jr 7:34 And I will bring to an end the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of the bride and bridegroom in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for the land shall become a waste.
24Jr 8:1 At that time, says the LORD, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs;
24Jr 8:2 and they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have followed, and which they have inquired of and worshiped; and they shall not be gathered or buried; they shall be like dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 8:3 Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, says the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 8:4 You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: When people fall, do they not get up again? If they go astray, do they not turn back?
24Jr 8:5 Why then has this people turned away in perpetual backsliding? They have held fast to deceit, they have refused to return.
24Jr 8:6 I have given heed and listened, but they do not speak honestly; no one repents of wickedness, saying, "What have I done!" All of them turn to their own course, like a horse plunging headlong into battle.
24Jr 8:7 Even the stork in the heavens knows its times; and the turtledove, swallow, and crane observe the time of their coming; but my people do not know the ordinance of the LORD.
24Jr 8:8 How can you say, "We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us," when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie?
24Jr 8:9 The wise shall be put to shame, they shall be dismayed and taken; since they have rejected the word of the LORD, what wisdom is in them?
24Jr 8:10 Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to conquerors, because from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for unjust gain; from prophet to priest everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 8:11 They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
24Jr 8:12 They acted shamefully, they committed abomination; yet they were not at all ashamed, they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time when I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the LORD.
24Jr 8:13 When I wanted to gather them, says the LORD, there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree; even the leaves are withered, and what I gave them has passed away from them.
24Jr 8:14 Why do we sit still? Gather together, let us go into the fortified cities and perish there; for the LORD our God has doomed us to perish, and has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 8:15 We look for peace, but find no good, for a time of healing, but there is terror instead.
24Jr 8:16 The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their stallions the whole land quakes. They come and devour the land and all that fills it, the city and those who live in it.
24Jr 8:17 See, I am letting snakes loose among you, adders that cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you, says the LORD.
24Jr 8:18 My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick.
24Jr 8:19 Hark, the cry of my poor people from far and wide in the land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?" ("Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols?")
24Jr 8:20 "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."
24Jr 8:21 For the hurt of my poor people I am hurt, I mourn, and dismay has taken hold of me.
24Jr 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of my poor people not been restored?
24Jr 9:1 O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my poor people!
24Jr 9:2 O that I had in the desert a traveler's lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, a band of traitors.
24Jr 9:3 They bend their tongues like bows; they have grown strong in the land for falsehood, and not for truth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, says the LORD.
24Jr 9:4 Beware of your neighbors, and put no trust in any of your kin; for all your kin are supplanters, and every neighbor goes around like a slanderer.
24Jr 9:5 They all deceive their neighbors, and no one speaks the truth; they have taught their tongues to speak lies; they commit iniquity and are too weary to repent.
24Jr 9:6 Oppression upon oppression, deceit upon deceit! They refuse to know me, says the LORD.
24Jr 9:7 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: I will now refine and test them, for what else can I do with my sinful people?
24Jr 9:8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit through the mouth. They all speak friendly words to their neighbors, but inwardly are planning to lay an ambush.
24Jr 9:9 Shall I not punish them for these things? says the LORD; and shall I not bring retribution on a nation such as this?
24Jr 9:10 Take up weeping and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, and the lowing of cattle is not heard; both the birds of the air and the animals have fled and are gone.
24Jr 9:11 I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair of jackals; and I will make the towns of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
24Jr 9:12 Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, so that they may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
24Jr 9:13 And the LORD says: Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, or walked in accordance with it,
24Jr 9:14 but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.
24Jr 9:15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am feeding this people with wormwood, and giving them poisonous water to drink.
24Jr 9:16 I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.
24Jr 9:17 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skilled women to come;
24Jr 9:18 let them quickly raise a dirge over us, so that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids flow with water.
24Jr 9:19 For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: "How we are ruined! We are utterly shamed, because we have left the land, because they have cast down our dwellings."
24Jr 9:20 Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, and let your ears receive the word of his mouth; teach to your daughters a dirge, and each to her neighbor a lament.
24Jr 9:21 "Death has come up into our windows, it has entered our palaces, to cut off the children from the streets and the young men from the squares."
24Jr 9:22 Speak! Thus says the LORD: "Human corpses shall fall like dung upon the open field, like sheaves behind the reaper, and no one shall gather them."
24Jr 9:23 Thus says the LORD: Do not let the wise boast in their wisdom, do not let the mighty boast in their might, do not let the wealthy boast in their wealth;
24Jr 9:24 but let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me, that I am the LORD; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the LORD.
24Jr 9:25 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will attend to all those who are circumcised only in the foreskin:
24Jr 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all those with shaven temples who live in the desert. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.
24Jr 10:1 Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
24Jr 10:2 Thus says the LORD: Do not learn the way of the nations, or be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.
24Jr 10:3 For the customs of the peoples are false: a tree from the forest is cut down, and worked with an ax by the hands of an artisan;
24Jr 10:4 people deck it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move.
24Jr 10:5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good.
24Jr 10:6 There is none like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.
24Jr 10:7 Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? For that is your due; among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you.
24Jr 10:8 They are both stupid and foolish; the instruction given by idols is no better than wood!
24Jr 10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. They are the work of the artisan and of the hands of the goldsmith; their clothing is blue and purple; they are all the product of skilled workers.
24Jr 10:10 But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.
24Jr 10:11 Thus shall you say to them: The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.
24Jr 10:12 It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 10:13 When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain, and he brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 10:14 Everyone is stupid and without knowledge; goldsmiths are all put to shame by their idols; for their images are false, and there is no breath in them.
24Jr 10:15 They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
24Jr 10:16 Not like these is the LORD, the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.
24Jr 10:17 Gather up your bundle from the ground, O you who live under siege!
24Jr 10:18 For thus says the LORD: I am going to sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress on them, so that they shall feel it.
24Jr 10:19 Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is severe. But I said, "Truly this is my punishment, and I must bear it."
24Jr 10:20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone from me, and they are no more; there is no one to spread my tent again, and to set up my curtains.
24Jr 10:21 For the shepherds are stupid, and do not inquire of the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
24Jr 10:22 Hear, a noise! Listen, it is coming--a great commotion from the land of the north to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals.
24Jr 10:23 I know, O LORD, that the way of human beings is not in their control, that mortals as they walk cannot direct their steps.
24Jr 10:24 Correct me, O LORD, but in just measure; not in your anger, or you will bring me to nothing.
24Jr 10:25 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you, and on the peoples that do not call on your name; for they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
24Jr 11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 11:2 Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:3 You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be anyone who does not heed the words of this covenant,
24Jr 11:4 which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron-smelter, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
24Jr 11:5 that I may perform the oath that I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then I answered, "So be it, LORD."
24Jr 11:6 And the LORD said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
24Jr 11:7 For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice.
24Jr 11:8 Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of an evil will. So I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.
24Jr 11:9 And the LORD said to me: Conspiracy exists among the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors of old, who refused to heed my words; they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their ancestors.
24Jr 11:11 Therefore, thus says the LORD, assuredly I am going to bring disaster upon them that they cannot escape; though they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.
24Jr 11:12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they will never save them in the time of their trouble.
24Jr 11:13 For your gods have become as many as your towns, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal.
24Jr 11:14 As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
24Jr 11:15 What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done vile deeds? Can vows and sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?
24Jr 11:16 The LORD once called you, "A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit"; but with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.
24Jr 11:17 The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.
24Jr 11:18 It was the LORD who made it known to me, and I knew; then you showed me their evil deeds.
24Jr 11:19 But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. And I did not know it was against me that they devised schemes, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will no longer be remembered!"
24Jr 11:20 But you, O LORD of hosts, who judge righteously, who try the heart and the mind, let me see your retribution upon them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24Jr 11:21 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the people of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, "You shall not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand"--
24Jr 11:22 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: I am going to punish them; the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
24Jr 11:23 and not even a remnant shall be left of them. For I will bring disaster upon the people of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.
24Jr 12:1 You will be in the right, O LORD, when I lay charges against you; but let me put my case to you. Why does the way of the guilty prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?
24Jr 12:2 You plant them, and they take root; they grow and bring forth fruit; you are near in their mouths yet far from their hearts.
24Jr 12:3 But you, O LORD, know me; You see me and test me--my heart is with you. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter.
24Jr 12:4 How long will the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither? For the wickedness of those who live in it the animals and the birds are swept away, and because people said, "He is blind to our ways."
24Jr 12:5 If you have raced with foot-runners and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses? And if in a safe land you fall down, how will you fare in the thickets of the Jordan?
24Jr 12:6 For even your kinsfolk and your own family, even they have dealt treacherously with you; they are in full cry after you; do not believe them, though they speak friendly words to you.
24Jr 12:7 I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my heritage; I have given the beloved of my heart into the hands of her enemies.
24Jr 12:8 My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest; she has lifted up her voice against me--therefore I hate her.
24Jr 12:9 Is the hyena greedy for my heritage at my command? Are the birds of prey all around her? Go, assemble all the wild animals; bring them to devour her.
24Jr 12:10 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trampled down my portion, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
24Jr 12:11 They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate, but no one lays it to heart.
24Jr 12:12 Upon all the bare heights in the desert spoilers have come; for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land to the other; no one shall be safe.
24Jr 12:13 They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
24Jr 12:14 Thus says the LORD concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage that I have given my people Israel to inherit: I am about to pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
24Jr 12:15 And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again to their heritage and to their land, everyone of them.
24Jr 12:16 And then, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, "As the LORD lives," as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
24Jr 12:17 But if any nation will not listen, then I will completely uproot it and destroy it, says the LORD.
24Jr 13:1 Thus said the LORD to me, "Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth, and put it on your loins, but do not dip it in water."
24Jr 13:2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.
24Jr 13:3 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,
24Jr 13:4 "Take the loincloth that you bought and are wearing, and go now to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."
24Jr 13:5 So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
24Jr 13:6 And after many days the LORD said to me, "Go now to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."
24Jr 13:7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. But now the loincloth was ruined; it was good for nothing.
24Jr 13:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 13:9 Thus says the LORD: Just so I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own will and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.
24Jr 13:11 For as the loincloth clings to one's loins, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the LORD, in order that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory. But they would not listen.
24Jr 13:12 You shall speak to them this word: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Every wine-jar should be filled with wine. And they will say to you, "Do you think we do not know that every wine-jar should be filled with wine?"
24Jr 13:13 Then you shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land--the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem--with drunkenness.
24Jr 13:14 And I will dash them one against another, parents and children together, says the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion when I destroy them.
24Jr 13:15 Hear and give ear; do not be haughty, for the LORD has spoken.
24Jr 13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, and before your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight; while you look for light, he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.
24Jr 13:17 But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive.
24Jr 13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother; "Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."
24Jr 13:19 The towns of the Negeb are shut up with no one to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.
24Jr 13:20 Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you have trained to be your allies? Will not pangs take hold of you, like those of a woman in labor?
24Jr 13:22 And if you say in your heart, "Why have these things come upon me?" it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you are violated.
24Jr 13:23 Can Ethiopians change their skin or leopards their spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
24Jr 13:24 I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
24Jr 13:25 This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, says the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies.
24Jr 13:26 I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.
24Jr 13:27 I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your shameless prostitutions on the hills of the countryside. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?
24Jr 14:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
24Jr 14:2 Judah mourns and her gates languish; they lie in gloom on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
24Jr 14:3 Her nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns, they find no water, they return with their vessels empty. They are ashamed and dismayed and cover their heads,
24Jr 14:4 because the ground is cracked. Because there has been no rain on the land the farmers are dismayed; they cover their heads.
24Jr 14:5 Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
24Jr 14:6 The wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail because there is no herbage.
24Jr 14:7 Although our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for your name's sake; our apostasies indeed are many, and we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:8 O hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, why should you be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler turning aside for the night?
24Jr 14:9 Why should you be like someone confused, like a mighty warrior who cannot give help? Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not forsake us!
24Jr 14:10 Thus says the LORD concerning this people: Truly they have loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.
24Jr 14:11 The LORD said to me: Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
24Jr 14:12 Although they fast, I do not hear their cry, and although they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I do not accept them; but by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence I consume them.
24Jr 14:13 Then I said: "Ah, Lord GOD! Here are the prophets saying to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you true peace in this place.'"
24Jr 14:14 And the LORD said to me: The prophets are prophesying lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds.
24Jr 14:15 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name though I did not send them, and who say, "Sword and famine shall not come on this land": By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
24Jr 14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword. There shall be no one to bury them--themselves, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them.
24Jr 14:17 You shall say to them this word: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter--my people--is struck down with a crushing blow, with a very grievous wound.
24Jr 14:18 If I go out into the field, look--those killed by the sword! And if I enter the city, look--those sick with famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade throughout the land, and have no knowledge.
24Jr 14:19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Does your heart loathe Zion? Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us? We look for peace, but find no good; for a time of healing, but there is terror instead.
24Jr 14:20 We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:21 Do not spurn us, for your name's sake; do not dishonor your glorious throne; remember and do not break your covenant with us.
24Jr 14:22 Can any idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not you, O LORD our God? We set our hope on you, for it is you who do all this.
24Jr 15:1 Then the LORD said to me: Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go!
24Jr 15:2 And when they say to you, "Where shall we go?" you shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: Those destined for pestilence, to pestilence, and those destined for the sword, to the sword; those destined for famine, to famine, and those destined for captivity, to captivity.
24Jr 15:3 And I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the air and the wild animals of the earth to devour and destroy.
24Jr 15:4 I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what King Manasseh son of Hezekiah of Judah did in Jerusalem.
24Jr 15:5 Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, or who will bemoan you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
24Jr 15:6 You have rejected me, says the LORD, you are going backward; so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you--I am weary of relenting.
24Jr 15:7 I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them, I have destroyed my people; they did not turn from their ways.
24Jr 15:8 Their widows became more numerous than the sand of the seas; I have brought against the mothers of youths a destroyer at noonday; I have made anguish and terror fall upon her suddenly.
24Jr 15:9 She who bore seven has languished; she has swooned away; her sun went down while it was yet day; she has been shamed and disgraced. And the rest of them I will give to the sword before their enemies, says the LORD.
24Jr 15:10 Woe is me, my mother, that you ever bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.
24Jr 15:11 The LORD said: Surely I have intervened in your life for good, surely I have imposed enemies on you in a time of trouble and in a time of distress.
24Jr 15:12 Can iron and bronze break iron from the north?
24Jr 15:13 Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory.
24Jr 15:14 I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.
24Jr 15:15 O LORD, you know; remember me and visit me, and bring down retribution for me on my persecutors. In your forbearance do not take me away; know that on your account I suffer insult.
24Jr 15:16 Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart; for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.
24Jr 15:17 I did not sit in the company of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice; under the weight of your hand I sat alone, for you had filled me with indignation.
24Jr 15:18 Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Truly, you are to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail.
24Jr 15:19 Therefore thus says the LORD: If you turn back, I will take you back, and you shall stand before me. If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, you shall serve as my mouth. It is they who will turn to you, not you who will turn to them.
24Jr 15:20 And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you, says the LORD.
24Jr 15:21 I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.
24Jr 16:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 16:2 You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
24Jr 16:3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bear them and the fathers who beget them in this land:
24Jr 16:4 They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall become like dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth.
24Jr 16:5 For thus says the LORD: Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament, or bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, says the LORD, my steadfast love and mercy.
24Jr 16:6 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them; there shall be no gashing, no shaving of the head for them.
24Jr 16:7 No one shall break bread for the mourner, to offer comfort for the dead; nor shall anyone give them the cup of consolation to drink for their fathers or their mothers.
24Jr 16:8 You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.
24Jr 16:9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to banish from this place, in your days and before your eyes, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
24Jr 16:10 And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, "Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?"
24Jr 16:11 then you shall say to them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken me, says the LORD, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law;
24Jr 16:12 and because you have behaved worse than your ancestors, for here you are, every one of you, following your stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to me.
24Jr 16:13 Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.
24Jr 16:14 Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, "As the LORD lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,"
24Jr 16:15 but "As the LORD lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had driven them." For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their ancestors.
24Jr 16:16 I am now sending for many fishermen, says the LORD, and they shall catch them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
24Jr 16:17 For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my presence, nor is their iniquity concealed from my sight.
24Jr 16:18 And I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.
24Jr 16:19 O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in the day of trouble, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and say: Our ancestors have inherited nothing but lies, worthless things in which there is no profit.
24Jr 16:20 Can mortals make for themselves gods? Such are no gods!
24Jr 16:21 "Therefore I am surely going to teach them, this time I am going to teach them my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the LORD."
24Jr 17:1 The sin of Judah is written with an iron pen; with a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their hearts, and on the horns of their altars,
24Jr 17:2 while their children remember their altars and their sacred poles, beside every green tree, and on the high hills,
24Jr 17:3 on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your sin throughout all your territory.
24Jr 17:4 By your own act you shall lose the heritage that I gave you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.
24Jr 17:5 Thus says the LORD: Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their strength, whose hearts turn away from the LORD.
24Jr 17:6 They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief comes. They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
24Jr 17:7 Blessed are those who trust in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.
24Jr 17:8 They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream. It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green; in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit.
24Jr 17:9 The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse--who can understand it?
24Jr 17:10 I the LORD test the mind and search the heart, to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.
24Jr 17:11 Like the partridge hatching what it did not lay, so are all who amass wealth unjustly; in mid-life it will leave them, and at their end they will prove to be fools.
24Jr 17:12 O glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, shrine of our sanctuary!
24Jr 17:13 O hope of Israel! O LORD! All who forsake you shall be put to shame; those who turn away from you shall be recorded in the underworld, for they have forsaken the fountain of living water, the LORD.
24Jr 17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for you are my praise.
24Jr 17:15 See how they say to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come!"
24Jr 17:16 But I have not run away from being a shepherd in your service, nor have I desired the fatal day. You know what came from my lips; it was before your face.
24Jr 17:17 Do not become a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster;
24Jr 17:18 Let my persecutors be shamed, but do not let me be shamed; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction!
24Jr 17:19 Thus said the LORD to me: Go and stand in the People's Gate, by which the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
24Jr 17:20 and say to them: Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
24Jr 17:21 Thus says the LORD: For the sake of your lives, take care that you do not bear a burden on the sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 17:22 And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the sabbath or do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors.
24Jr 17:23 Yet they did not listen or incline their ear; they stiffened their necks and would not hear or receive instruction.
24Jr 17:24 But if you listen to me, says the LORD, and bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but keep the sabbath day holy and do no work on it,
24Jr 17:25 then there shall enter by the gates of this city kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited forever.
24Jr 17:26 And people shall come from the towns of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
24Jr 17:27 But if you do not listen to me, to keep the sabbath day holy, and to carry in no burden through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates; it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.
24Jr 18:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 18:2 "Come, go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words."
24Jr 18:3 So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.
24Jr 18:4 The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.
24Jr 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 18:6 Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the LORD. Just like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
24Jr 18:7 At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,
24Jr 18:8 but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it.
24Jr 18:9 And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,
24Jr 18:10 but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it.
24Jr 18:11 Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
24Jr 18:12 But they say, "It is no use! We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of our evil will."
24Jr 18:13 Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations: Who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a most horrible thing.
24Jr 18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion? Do the mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?
24Jr 18:15 But my people have forgotten me, they burn offerings to a delusion; they have stumbled in their ways, in the ancient roads, and have gone into bypaths, not the highway,
24Jr 18:16 making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at forever. All who pass by it are horrified and shake their heads.
24Jr 18:17 Like the wind from the east, I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity.
24Jr 18:18 Then they said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah--for instruction shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us bring charges against him, and let us not heed any of his words."
24Jr 18:19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and listen to what my adversaries say!
24Jr 18:20 Is evil a recompense for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
24Jr 18:21 Therefore give their children over to famine; hurl them out to the power of the sword, let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be slain by the sword in battle.
24Jr 18:22 May a cry be heard from their houses, when you bring the marauder suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to catch me, and laid snares for my feet.
24Jr 18:23 Yet you, O LORD, know all their plotting to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, do not blot out their sin from your sight. Let them be tripped up before you; deal with them while you are angry.
24Jr 19:1 Thus said the LORD: Go and buy a potter's earthenware jug. Take with you some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests,
24Jr 19:2 and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you.
24Jr 19:3 You shall say: Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
24Jr 19:4 Because the people have forsaken me, and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent,
24Jr 19:5 and gone on building the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it enter my mind.
24Jr 19:6 Therefore the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter.
24Jr 19:7 And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth.
24Jr 19:8 And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters.
24Jr 19:9 And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and all shall eat the flesh of their neighbors in the siege, and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.
24Jr 19:10 Then you shall break the jug in the sight of those who go with you,
24Jr 19:11 and shall say to them: Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended. In Topheth they shall bury until there is no more room to bury.
24Jr 19:12 Thus will I do to this place, says the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth.
24Jr 19:13 And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Topheth--all the houses upon whose roofs offerings have been made to the whole host of heaven, and libations have been poured out to other gods.
24Jr 19:14 When Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people:
24Jr 19:15 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am now bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their necks, refusing to hear my words.
24Jr 20:1 Now the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
24Jr 20:2 Then Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
24Jr 20:3 The next morning when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, The LORD has named you not Pashhur but "Terror-all-around."
24Jr 20:4 For thus says the LORD: I am making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.
24Jr 20:5 I will give all the wealth of this city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and seize them, and carry them to Babylon.
24Jr 20:6 And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, shall go into captivity, and to Babylon you shall go; there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.
24Jr 20:7 O LORD, you have enticed me, and I was enticed; you have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.
24Jr 20:8 For whenever I speak, I must cry out, I must shout, "Violence and destruction!" For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.
24Jr 20:9 If I say, "I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name," then within me there is something like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.
24Jr 20:10 For I hear many whispering: "Terror is all around! Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" All my close friends are watching for me to stumble. "Perhaps he can be enticed, and we can prevail against him, and take our revenge on him."
24Jr 20:11 But the LORD is with me like a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
24Jr 20:12 O LORD of hosts, you test the righteous, you see the heart and the mind; let me see your retribution upon them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.
24Jr 20:14 Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!
24Jr 20:15 Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, "A child is born to you, a son," making him very glad.
24Jr 20:16 Let that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,
24Jr 20:17 because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb forever great.
24Jr 20:18 Why did I come forth from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?
24Jr 21:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, saying,
24Jr 21:2 "Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon is making war against us; perhaps the LORD will perform a wonderful deed for us, as he has often done, and will make him withdraw from us."
24Jr 21:3 Then Jeremiah said to them:
24Jr 21:4 Thus you shall say to Zedekiah: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I am going to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls; and I will bring them together into the center of this city.
24Jr 21:5 I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in anger, in fury, and in great wrath.
24Jr 21:6 And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both human beings and animals; they shall die of a great pestilence.
24Jr 21:7 Afterward, says the LORD, I will give King Zedekiah of Judah, and his servants, and the people in this city--those who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine--into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword; he shall not pity them, or spare them, or have compassion.
24Jr 21:8 And to this people you shall say: Thus says the LORD: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death.
24Jr 21:9 Those who stay in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but those who go out and surrender to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have their lives as a prize of war.
24Jr 21:10 For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, says the LORD: it shall be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
24Jr 21:11 To the house of the king of Judah say: Hear the word of the LORD,
24Jr 21:12 O house of David! Thus says the LORD: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor anyone who has been robbed, or else my wrath will go forth like fire, and burn, with no one to quench it, because of your evil doings.
24Jr 21:13 See, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, O rock of the plain, says the LORD; you who say, "Who can come down against us, or who can enter our places of refuge?"
24Jr 21:14 I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the LORD; I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall devour all that is around it.
24Jr 22:1 Thus says the LORD: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
24Jr 22:2 and say: Hear the word of the LORD, O King of Judah sitting on the throne of David--you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates.
24Jr 22:3 Thus says the LORD: Act with justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor anyone who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place.
24Jr 22:4 For if you will indeed obey this word, then through the gates of this house shall enter kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their servants, and their people.
24Jr 22:5 But if you will not heed these words, I swear by myself, says the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
24Jr 22:6 For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon; but I swear that I will make you a desert, an uninhabited city.
24Jr 22:7 I will prepare destroyers against you, all with their weapons; they shall cut down your choicest cedars and cast them into the fire.
24Jr 22:8 And many nations will pass by this city, and all of them will say one to another, "Why has the LORD dealt in this way with that great city?"
24Jr 22:9 And they will answer, "Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods and served them."
24Jr 22:10 Do not weep for him who is dead, nor bemoan him; weep rather for him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land.
24Jr 22:11 For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum son of King Josiah of Judah, who succeeded his father Josiah, and who went away from this place: He shall return here no more,
24Jr 22:12 but in the place where they have carried him captive he shall die, and he shall never see this land again.
24Jr 22:13 Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice; who makes his neighbors work for nothing, and does not give them their wages;
24Jr 22:14 who says, "I will build myself a spacious house with large upper rooms," and who cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar, and painting it with vermilion.
24Jr 22:15 Are you a king because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
24Jr 22:16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know me? says the LORD.
24Jr 22:17 But your eyes and heart are only on your dishonest gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for practicing oppression and violence.
24Jr 22:18 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah: They shall not lament for him, saying, "Alas, my brother!" or "Alas, sister!" They shall not lament for him, saying, "Alas, lord!" or "Alas, his majesty!"
24Jr 22:19 With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried--dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 22:20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are crushed.
24Jr 22:21 I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, "I will not listen." This has been your way from your youth, for you have not obeyed my voice.
24Jr 22:22 The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; then you will be ashamed and dismayed because of all your wickedness.
24Jr 22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in labor!
24Jr 22:24 As I live, says the LORD, even if King Coniah son of Jehoiakim of Judah were the signet ring on my right hand, even from there I would tear you off
24Jr 22:25 and give you into the hands of those who seek your life, into the hands of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 22:26 I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die.
24Jr 22:27 But they shall not return to the land to which they long to return.
24Jr 22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised broken pot, a vessel no one wants? Why are he and his offspring hurled out and cast away in a land that they do not know?
24Jr 22:29 O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!
24Jr 22:30 Thus says the LORD: Record this man as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days; for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David, and ruling again in Judah.
24Jr 23:1 Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD.
24Jr 23:2 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD.
24Jr 23:3 Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
24Jr 23:4 I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.
24Jr 23:5 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 23:6 In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: "The LORD is our righteousness."
24Jr 23:7 Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, "As the LORD lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,"
24Jr 23:8 but "As the LORD lives who brought out and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had driven them." Then they shall live in their own land.
24Jr 23:9 Concerning the prophets: My heart is crushed within me, all my bones shake; I have become like a drunkard, like one overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words.
24Jr 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course has been evil, and their might is not right.
24Jr 23:11 Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their wickedness, says the LORD.
24Jr 23:12 Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall; for I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.
24Jr 23:13 In the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24Jr 23:14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a more shocking thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from wickedness; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.
24Jr 23:15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: "I am going to make them eat wormwood, and give them poisoned water to drink; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land."
24Jr 23:16 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you; they are deluding you. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
24Jr 23:17 They keep saying to those who despise the word of the LORD, "It shall be well with you"; and to all who stubbornly follow their own stubborn hearts, they say, "No calamity shall come upon you."
24Jr 23:18 For who has stood in the council of the LORD so as to see and to hear his word? Who has given heed to his word so as to proclaim it?
24Jr 23:19 Look, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
24Jr 23:20 The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
24Jr 23:21 I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
24Jr 23:22 But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
24Jr 23:23 Am I a God near by, says the LORD, and not a God far off?
24Jr 23:24 Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them? says the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the LORD.
24Jr 23:25 I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, "I have dreamed, I have dreamed!"
24Jr 23:26 How long? Will the hearts of the prophets ever turn back--those who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart?
24Jr 23:27 They plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, just as their ancestors forgot my name for Baal.
24Jr 23:28 Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let the one who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says the LORD.
24Jr 23:29 Is not my word like fire, says the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?
24Jr 23:30 See, therefore, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who steal my words from one another.
24Jr 23:31 See, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who use their own tongues and say, "Says the LORD."
24Jr 23:32 See, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the LORD, and who tell them, and who lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or appoint them; so they do not profit this people at all, says the LORD.
24Jr 23:33 When this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, "What is the burden of the LORD?" you shall say to them, "You are the burden, and I will cast you off, says the LORD."
24Jr 23:34 And as for the prophet, priest, or the people who say, "The burden of the LORD," I will punish them and their households.
24Jr 23:35 Thus shall you say to one another, among yourselves, "What has the LORD answered?" or "What has the LORD spoken?"
24Jr 23:36 But "the burden of the LORD" you shall mention no more, for the burden is everyone's own word, and so you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
24Jr 23:37 Thus you shall ask the prophet, "What has the LORD answered you?" or "What has the LORD spoken?"
24Jr 23:38 But if you say, "the burden of the LORD," thus says the LORD: Because you have said these words, "the burden of the LORD," when I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, "the burden of the LORD,"
24Jr 23:39 therefore, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your ancestors.
24Jr 23:40 And I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
24Jr 24:1 The LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD. This was after King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, together with the officials of Judah, the artisans, and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon.
24Jr 24:2 One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
24Jr 24:3 And the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."
24Jr 24:4 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 24:5 Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 24:6 I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
24Jr 24:7 I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
24Jr 24:8 But thus says the LORD: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 24:9 I will make them a horror, an evil thing, to all the kingdoms of the earth--a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.
24Jr 24:10 And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they are utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.
24Jr 25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah (that was the first year of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon),
24Jr 25:2 which the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
24Jr 25:3 For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened.
24Jr 25:4 And though the LORD persistently sent you all his servants the prophets, you have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear
24Jr 25:5 when they said, "Turn now, everyone of you, from your evil way and wicked doings, and you will remain upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your ancestors from of old and forever;
24Jr 25:6 do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm."
24Jr 25:7 Yet you did not listen to me, says the LORD, and so you have provoked me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.
24Jr 25:8 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
24Jr 25:9 I am going to send for all the tribes of the north, says the LORD, even for King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these nations around; I will utterly destroy them, and make them an object of horror and of hissing, and an everlasting disgrace.
24Jr 25:10 And I will banish from them the sound of mirth and the sound of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
24Jr 25:11 This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
24Jr 25:12 Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste.
24Jr 25:13 I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
24Jr 25:14 For many nations and great kings shall make slaves of them also; and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.
24Jr 25:15 For thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24Jr 25:16 They shall drink and stagger and go out of their minds because of the sword that I am sending among them.
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
24Jr 25:18 Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolation and a waste, an object of hissing and of cursing, as they are today;
24Jr 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people;
24Jr 25:20 all the mixed people; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines--Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
24Jr 25:21 Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
24Jr 25:22 all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea;
24Jr 25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have shaven temples;
24Jr 25:24 all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed peoples that live in the desert;
24Jr 25:25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
24Jr 25:26 all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Sheshach shall drink.
24Jr 25:27 Then you shall say to them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, get drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword that I am sending among you.
24Jr 25:28 And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them: Thus says the LORD of hosts: You must drink!
24Jr 25:29 See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and how can you possibly avoid punishment? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, says the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 25:30 You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: The LORD will roar from on high, and from his holy habitation utter his voice; he will roar mightily against his fold, and shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24Jr 25:31 The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD has an indictment against the nations; he is entering into judgment with all flesh, and the guilty he will put to the sword, says the LORD.
24Jr 25:32 Thus says the LORD of hosts: See, disaster is spreading from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth!
24Jr 25:33 Those slain by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall become dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 25:34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, for the days of your slaughter have come--and your dispersions, and you shall fall like a choice vessel.
24Jr 25:35 Flight shall fail the shepherds, and there shall be no escape for the lords of the flock.
24Jr 25:36 Hark! the cry of the shepherds, and the wail of the lords of the flock! For the LORD is despoiling their pasture,
24Jr 25:37 and the peaceful folds are devastated, because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
24Jr 25:38 Like a lion he has left his covert; for their land has become a waste because of the cruel sword, and because of his fierce anger.
24Jr 26:1 At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
24Jr 26:2 Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD; speak to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word.
24Jr 26:3 It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their evil doings.
24Jr 26:4 You shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,
24Jr 26:5 and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently--though you have not heeded--
24Jr 26:6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.
24Jr 26:7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:8 And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, "You shall die!
24Jr 26:9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:10 When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
24Jr 26:11 Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
24Jr 26:12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, "It is the LORD who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
24Jr 26:13 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against you.
24Jr 26:14 But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
24Jr 26:15 Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."
24Jr 26:16 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
24Jr 26:17 And some of the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembled people,
24Jr 26:18 "Micah of Moresheth, who prophesied during the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'
24Jr 26:19 Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah actually put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD change his mind about the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster on ourselves!"
24Jr 26:20 There was another man prophesying in the name of the LORD, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words exactly like those of Jeremiah.
24Jr 26:21 And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
24Jr 26:22 Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Achbor and men with him to Egypt,
24Jr 26:23 and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and threw his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
24Jr 26:24 But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over into the hands of the people to be put to death.
24Jr 27:1 In the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
24Jr 27:2 Thus the LORD said to me: Make yourself a yoke of straps and bars, and put them on your neck.
24Jr 27:3 Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah.
24Jr 27:4 Give them this charge for their masters: Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:
24Jr 27:5 It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the people and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever I please.
24Jr 27:6 Now I have given all these lands into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him even the wild animals of the field to serve him.
24Jr 27:7 All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
24Jr 27:8 But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this king, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, then I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, says the LORD, until I have completed its destruction by his hand.
24Jr 27:9 You, therefore, must not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'
24Jr 27:10 For they are prophesying a lie to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land; I will drive you out, and you will perish.
24Jr 27:11 But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, says the LORD, to till it and live there.
24Jr 27:12 I spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah in the same way: Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
24Jr 27:13 Why should you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
24Jr 27:14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you not to serve the king of Babylon, for they are prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:15 I have not sent them, says the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.
24Jr 27:16 Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, "The vessels of the LORD's house will soon be brought back from Babylon," for they are prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:17 Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
24Jr 27:18 If indeed they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
24Jr 27:19 For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
24Jr 27:20 which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--
24Jr 27:21 thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
24Jr 27:22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall stay, until the day when I give attention to them, says the LORD. Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.
24Jr 28:1 In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
24Jr 28:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 28:3 Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
24Jr 28:4 I will also bring back to this place King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the LORD, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
24Jr 28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD;
24Jr 28:6 and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD fulfill the words that you have prophesied, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles.
24Jr 28:7 But listen now to this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
24Jr 28:8 The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms.
24Jr 28:9 As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes true, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet."
24Jr 28:10 Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, and broke it.
24Jr 28:11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: This is how I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years." At this, the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
24Jr 28:12 Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 28:13 Go, tell Hananiah, Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars only to forge iron bars in place of them!
24Jr 28:14 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all these nations so that they may serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and they shall indeed serve him; I have even given him the wild animals.
24Jr 28:15 And the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you made this people trust in a lie.
24Jr 28:16 Therefore thus says the LORD: I am going to send you off the face of the earth. Within this year you will be dead, because you have spoken rebellion against the LORD."
24Jr 28:17 In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
24Jr 29:1 These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24Jr 29:2 This was after King Jeconiah, and the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.
24Jr 29:3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. It said:
24Jr 29:4 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24Jr 29:5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce.
24Jr 29:6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
24Jr 29:7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
24Jr 29:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let the prophets and the diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream,
24Jr 29:9 for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, says the LORD.
24Jr 29:10 For thus says the LORD: Only when Babylon's seventy years are completed will I visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place.
24Jr 29:11 For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the LORD, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.
24Jr 29:12 Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you.
24Jr 29:13 When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart,
24Jr 29:14 I will let you find me, says the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
24Jr 29:15 Because you have said, "The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,"--
24Jr 29:16 Thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who live in this city, your kinsfolk who did not go out with you into exile:
24Jr 29:17 Thus says the LORD of hosts, I am going to let loose on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like rotten figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
24Jr 29:18 I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of cursing, and horror, and hissing, and a derision among all the nations where I have driven them,
24Jr 29:19 because they did not heed my words, says the LORD, when I persistently sent to you my servants the prophets, but they would not listen, says the LORD.
24Jr 29:20 But now, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon, hear the word of the LORD:
24Jr 29:21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: I am going to deliver them into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.
24Jr 29:22 And on account of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
24Jr 29:23 because they have perpetrated outrage in Israel and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them; I am the one who knows and bears witness, says the LORD.
24Jr 29:24 To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
24Jr 29:25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: In your own name you sent a letter to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying,
24Jr 29:26 The LORD himself has made you priest instead of the priest Jehoiada, so that there may be officers in the house of the LORD to control any madman who plays the prophet, to put him in the stocks and the collar.
24Jr 29:27 So now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who plays the prophet for you?
24Jr 29:28 For he has actually sent to us in Babylon, saying, "It will be a long time; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat what they produce."
24Jr 29:29 The priest Zephaniah read this letter in the hearing of the prophet Jeremiah.
24Jr 29:30 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 29:31 Send to all the exiles, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has led you to trust in a lie,
24Jr 29:32 therefore thus says the LORD: I am going to punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants; he shall not have anyone living among this people to see the good that I am going to do to my people, says the LORD, for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.
24Jr 30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 30:2 Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
24Jr 30:3 For the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the LORD, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors and they shall take possession of it.
24Jr 30:4 These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
24Jr 30:5 Thus says the LORD: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace.
24Jr 30:6 Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?
24Jr 30:7 Alas! that day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be rescued from it.
24Jr 30:8 On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will break the yoke from off his neck, and I will burst his bonds, and strangers shall no more make a servant of him.
24Jr 30:9 But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24Jr 30:10 But as for you, have no fear, my servant Jacob, says the LORD, and do not be dismayed, O Israel; for I am going to save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and no one shall make him afraid.
24Jr 30:11 For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you; I will make an end of all the nations among which I scattered you, but of you I will not make an end. I will chastise you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
24Jr 30:12 For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, your wound is grievous.
24Jr 30:13 There is no one to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you.
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are so numerous.
24Jr 30:15 Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are so numerous, I have done these things to you.
24Jr 30:16 Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.
24Jr 30:17 For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, says the LORD, because they have called you an outcast: "It is Zion; no one cares for her!"
24Jr 30:18 Thus says the LORD: I am going to restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob, and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt upon its mound, and the citadel set on its rightful site.
24Jr 30:19 Out of them shall come thanksgiving, and the sound of merrymakers. I will make them many, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be disdained.
24Jr 30:20 Their children shall be as of old, their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.
24Jr 30:21 Their prince shall be one of their own, their ruler shall come from their midst; I will bring him near, and he shall approach me, for who would otherwise dare to approach me? says the LORD.
24Jr 30:22 And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
24Jr 30:23 Look, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
24Jr 30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will understand this.
24Jr 31:1 At that time, says the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
24Jr 31:2 Thus says the LORD: The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; when Israel sought for rest,
24Jr 31:3 the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
24Jr 31:4 Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel! Again you shall take your tambourines, and go forth in the dance of the merrymakers.
24Jr 31:5 Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit.
24Jr 31:6 For there shall be a day when sentinels will call in the hill country of Ephraim: "Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God."
24Jr 31:7 For thus says the LORD: Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, "Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel."
24Jr 31:8 See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.
24Jr 31:9 With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back, I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble; for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
24Jr 31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; say, "He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock."
24Jr 31:11 For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
24Jr 31:12 They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD, over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.
24Jr 31:13 Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry. I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.
24Jr 31:14 I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty, says the LORD.
24Jr 31:15 Thus says the LORD: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.
24Jr 31:16 Thus says the LORD: Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for there is a reward for your work, says the LORD: they shall come back from the land of the enemy;
24Jr 31:17 there is hope for your future, says the LORD: your children shall come back to their own country.
24Jr 31:18 Indeed I heard Ephraim pleading: "You disciplined me, and I took the discipline; I was like a calf untrained. Bring me back, let me come back, for you are the LORD my God.
24Jr 31:19 For after I had turned away I repented; and after I was discovered, I struck my thigh; I was ashamed, and I was dismayed because I bore the disgrace of my youth."
24Jr 31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he the child I delight in? As often as I speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore I am deeply moved for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says the LORD.
24Jr 31:21 Set up road markers for yourself, make yourself guideposts; consider well the highway, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin Israel, return to these your cities.
24Jr 31:22 How long will you waver, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing on the earth: a woman encompasses a man.
24Jr 31:23 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its towns when I restore their fortunes: "The LORD bless you, O abode of righteousness, O holy hill!"
24Jr 31:24 And Judah and all its towns shall live there together, and the farmers and those who wander with their flocks.
24Jr 31:25 I will satisfy the weary, and all who are faint I will replenish.
24Jr 31:26 Thereupon I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
24Jr 31:27 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals.
24Jr 31:28 And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD.
24Jr 31:29 In those days they shall no longer say: "The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge."
24Jr 31:30 But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge.
24Jr 31:31 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24Jr 31:32 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt--a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD.
24Jr 31:33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
24Jr 31:34 No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, "Know the LORD," for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.
24Jr 31:35 Thus says the LORD, who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar--the LORD of hosts is his name:
24Jr 31:36 If this fixed order were ever to cease from my presence, says the LORD, then also the offspring of Israel would cease to be a nation before me forever.
24Jr 31:37 Thus says the LORD: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all they have done, says the LORD.
24Jr 31:38 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24Jr 31:39 And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah.
24Jr 31:40 The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Wadi Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be sacred to the LORD. It shall never again be uprooted or overthrown.
24Jr 32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
24Jr 32:2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah,
24Jr 32:3 where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him. Zedekiah had said, "Why do you prophesy and say: Thus says the LORD: I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
24Jr 32:4 King Zedekiah of Judah shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;
24Jr 32:5 and he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I attend to him, says the LORD; though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed?"
24Jr 32:6 Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 32:7 Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, "Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours."
24Jr 32:8 Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, "Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself." Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
24Jr 32:9 And I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
24Jr 32:10 I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.
24Jr 32:11 Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy;
24Jr 32:12 and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard.
24Jr 32:13 In their presence I charged Baruch, saying,
24Jr 32:14 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.
24Jr 32:15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.
24Jr 32:16 After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
24Jr 32:17 Ah Lord GOD! It is you who made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.
24Jr 32:18 You show steadfast love to the thousandth generation, but repay the guilt of parents into the laps of their children after them, O great and mighty God whose name is the LORD of hosts,
24Jr 32:19 great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways of mortals, rewarding all according to their ways and according to the fruit of their doings.
24Jr 32:20 You showed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all humankind, and have made yourself a name that continues to this very day.
24Jr 32:21 You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror;
24Jr 32:22 and you gave them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
24Jr 32:23 and they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or follow your law; of all you commanded them to do, they did nothing. Therefore you have made all these disasters come upon them.
24Jr 32:24 See, the siege-ramps have been cast up against the city to take it, and the city, faced with sword, famine, and pestilence, has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has happened, as you yourself can see.
24Jr 32:25 Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"--though the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 32:26 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 32:27 See, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too hard for me?
24Jr 32:28 Therefore, thus says the LORD: I am going to give this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he shall take it.
24Jr 32:29 The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come, set it on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and libations have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
24Jr 32:30 For the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; the people of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the LORD.
24Jr 32:31 This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built until this day, so that I will remove it from my sight
24Jr 32:32 because of all the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger--they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the citizens of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24Jr 32:33 They have turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I have taught them persistently, they would not listen and accept correction.
24Jr 32:34 They set up their abominations in the house that bears my name, and defiled it.
24Jr 32:35 They built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter my mind that they should do this abomination, causing Judah to sin.
24Jr 32:36 Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, "It is being given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence":
24Jr 32:37 See, I am going to gather them from all the lands to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to this place, and I will settle them in safety.
24Jr 32:38 They shall be my people, and I will be their God.
24Jr 32:39 I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for all time, for their own good and the good of their children after them.
24Jr 32:40 I will make an everlasting covenant with them, never to draw back from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they may not turn from me.
24Jr 32:41 I will rejoice in doing good to them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
24Jr 32:42 For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good fortune that I now promise them.
24Jr 32:43 Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation, without human beings or animals; it has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 32:44 Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, of the hill country, of the Shephelah, and of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:1 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard:
24Jr 33:2 Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it--the LORD is his name:
24Jr 33:3 Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.
24Jr 33:4 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege-ramps and before the sword:
24Jr 33:5 The Chaldeans are coming in to fight and to fill them with the dead bodies of those whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness.
24Jr 33:6 I am going to bring it recovery and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.
24Jr 33:7 I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first.
24Jr 33:8 I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.
24Jr 33:9 And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them; they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.
24Jr 33:10 Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, "It is a waste without human beings or animals," in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without inhabitants, human or animal, there shall once more be heard
24Jr 33:11 the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD: "Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!" For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:12 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place that is waste, without human beings or animals, and in all its towns there shall again be pasture for shepherds resting their flocks.
24Jr 33:13 In the towns of the hill country, of the Shephelah, and of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:14 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24Jr 33:15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 33:16 In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: "The LORD is our righteousness."
24Jr 33:17 For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
24Jr 33:18 and the levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to make grain offerings, and to make sacrifices for all time.
24Jr 33:19 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:20 Thus says the LORD: If any of you could break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their appointed time,
24Jr 33:21 only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken, so that he would not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with my ministers the Levites.
24Jr 33:22 Just as the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will increase the offspring of my servant David, and the Levites who minister to me.
24Jr 33:23 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:24 Have you not observed how these people say, "The two families that the LORD chose have been rejected by him," and how they hold my people in such contempt that they no longer regard them as a nation?
24Jr 33:25 Thus says the LORD: Only if I had not established my covenant with day and night and the ordinances of heaven and earth,
24Jr 33:26 would I reject the offspring of Jacob and of my servant David and not choose any of his descendants as rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy upon them.
24Jr 34:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth and all the peoples under his dominion were fighting against Jerusalem and all its cities:
24Jr 34:2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to King Zedekiah of Judah and say to him: Thus says the LORD: I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
24Jr 34:3 And you yourself shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be captured and handed over to him; you shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face; and you shall go to Babylon.
24Jr 34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O King Zedekiah of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: You shall not die by the sword;
24Jr 34:5 you shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your ancestors, the earlier kings who preceded you, so they shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, "Alas, lord!" For I have spoken the word, says the LORD.
24Jr 34:6 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
24Jr 34:7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
24Jr 34:8 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
24Jr 34:9 that all should set free their Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should hold another Judean in slavery.
24Jr 34:10 And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that all would set free their slaves, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free.
24Jr 34:11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them again into subjection as slaves.
24Jr 34:12 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 34:13 Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,
24Jr 34:14 "Every seventh year each of you must set free any Hebrews who have been sold to you and have served you six years; you must set them free from your service." But your ancestors did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
24Jr 34:15 You yourselves recently repented and did what was right in my sight by proclaiming liberty to one another, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name;
24Jr 34:16 but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back your male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them again into subjection to be your slaves.
24Jr 34:17 Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by granting a release to your neighbors and friends; I am going to grant a release to you, says the LORD--a release to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24Jr 34:18 And those who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make like the calf when they cut it in two and passed between its parts:
24Jr 34:19 the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf
24Jr 34:20 shall be handed over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives. Their corpses shall become food for the birds of the air and the wild animals of the earth.
24Jr 34:21 And as for King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials, I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.
24Jr 34:22 I am going to command, says the LORD, and will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. The towns of Judah I will make a desolation without inhabitant.
24Jr 35:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:
24Jr 35:2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.
24Jr 35:3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
24Jr 35:4 I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.
24Jr 35:5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, "Have some wine."
24Jr 35:6 But they answered, "We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, 'You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children;
24Jr 35:7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.'
24Jr 35:8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
24Jr 35:9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed;
24Jr 35:10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
24Jr 35:11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.' That is why we are living in Jerusalem."
24Jr 35:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 35:13 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the LORD.
24Jr 35:14 The command has been carried out that Jonadab son of Rechab gave to his descendants to drink no wine; and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their ancestor's command. But I myself have spoken to you persistently, and you have not obeyed me.
24Jr 35:15 I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, 'Turn now everyone of you from your evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall live in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors.' But you did not incline your ear or obey me.
24Jr 35:16 The descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the command that their ancestor gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
24Jr 35:17 Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.
24Jr 35:18 But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab, and kept all his precepts, and done all that he commanded you,
24Jr 35:19 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab son of Rechab shall not lack a descendant to stand before me for all time.
24Jr 36:1 In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 36:2 Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
24Jr 36:3 It may be that when the house of Judah hears of all the disasters that I intend to do to them, all of them may turn from their evil ways, so that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
24Jr 36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at Jeremiah's dictation all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
24Jr 36:5 And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, "I am prevented from entering the house of the LORD;
24Jr 36:6 so you go yourself, and on a fast day in the hearing of the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the people of Judah who come up from their towns.
24Jr 36:7 It may be that their plea will come before the LORD, and that all of them will turn from their evil ways, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
24Jr 36:8 And Baruch son of Neriah did all that the prophet Jeremiah ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
24Jr 36:9 In the fifth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
24Jr 36:10 Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
24Jr 36:11 When Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
24Jr 36:12 he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber; and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
24Jr 36:13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
24Jr 36:14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
24Jr 36:15 And they said to him, "Sit down and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
24Jr 36:16 When they heard all the words, they turned to one another in alarm, and said to Baruch, "We certainly must report all these words to the king."
24Jr 36:17 Then they questioned Baruch, "Tell us now, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
24Jr 36:18 Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll."
24Jr 36:19 Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."
24Jr 36:20 Leaving the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, they went to the court of the king; and they reported all the words to the king.
24Jr 36:21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
24Jr 36:22 Now the king was sitting in his winter apartment (it was the ninth month), and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him.
24Jr 36:23 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
24Jr 36:24 Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words, was alarmed, nor did they tear their garments.
24Jr 36:25 Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24Jr 36:26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the secretary Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But the LORD hid them.
24Jr 36:27 Now, after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 36:28 Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which King Jehoiakim of Judah has burned.
24Jr 36:29 And concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah you shall say: Thus says the LORD, You have dared to burn this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it human beings and animals?
24Jr 36:30 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah: He shall have no one to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
24Jr 36:31 And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah, all the disasters with which I have threatened them--but they would not listen.
24Jr 36:32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the secretary Baruch son of Neriah, who wrote on it at Jeremiah's dictation all the words of the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
24Jr 37:1 Zedekiah son of Josiah, whom King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, succeeded Coniah son of Jehoiakim.
24Jr 37:2 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.
24Jr 37:3 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah saying, "Please pray for us to the LORD our God."
24Jr 37:4 Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
24Jr 37:5 Meanwhile, the army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
24Jr 37:6 Then the word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah:
24Jr 37:7 Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: This is what the two of you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me, Pharaoh's army, which set out to help you, is going to return to its own land, to Egypt.
24Jr 37:8 And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.
24Jr 37:9 Thus says the LORD: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go away.
24Jr 37:10 Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.
24Jr 37:11 Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,
24Jr 37:12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his share of property among the people there.
24Jr 37:13 When he reached the Benjamin Gate, a sentinel there named Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah arrested the prophet Jeremiah saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
24Jr 37:14 And Jeremiah said, "That is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Irijah would not listen to him, and arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24Jr 37:15 The officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of the secretary Jonathan, for it had been made a prison.
24Jr 37:16 Thus Jeremiah was put in the cistern house, in the cells, and remained there many days.
24Jr 37:17 Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is!" Then he said, "You shall be handed over to the king of Babylon."
24Jr 37:18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
24Jr 37:19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?
24Jr 37:20 Now please hear me, my lord king: be good enough to listen to my plea, and do not send me back to the house of the secretary Jonathan to die there."
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
24Jr 38:1 Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
24Jr 38:2 Thus says the LORD, Those who stay in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but those who go out to the Chaldeans shall live; they shall have their lives as a prize of war, and live.
24Jr 38:3 Thus says the LORD, This city shall surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.
24Jr 38:4 Then the officials said to the king, "This man ought to be put to death, because he is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, and all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah said, "Here he is; he is in your hands; for the king is powerless against you."
24Jr 38:6 So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. Now there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
24Jr 38:7 Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. The king happened to be sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
24Jr 38:8 So Ebed-melech left the king's house and spoke to the king,
24Jr 38:9 "My lord king, these men have acted wickedly in all they did to the prophet Jeremiah by throwing him into the cistern to die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."
24Jr 38:10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, "Take three men with you from here, and pull the prophet Jeremiah up from the cistern before he dies."
24Jr 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe of the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.
24Jr 38:12 Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Just put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.
24Jr 38:13 Then they drew Jeremiah up by the ropes and pulled him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
24Jr 38:14 King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I have something to ask you; do not hide anything from me."
24Jr 38:15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, you will put me to death, will you not? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me."
24Jr 38:16 So King Zedekiah swore an oath in secret to Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who gave us our lives, I will not put you to death or hand you over to these men who seek your life."
24Jr 38:17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will only surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
24Jr 38:18 But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be handed over to the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand."
24Jr 38:19 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for I might be handed over to them and they would abuse me."
24Jr 38:20 Jeremiah said, "That will not happen. Just obey the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall go well with you, and your life shall be spared.
24Jr 38:21 But if you are determined not to surrender, this is what the LORD has shown me--
24Jr 38:22 a vision of all the women remaining in the house of the king of Judah being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and saying, 'Your trusted friends have seduced you and have overcome you; Now that your feet are stuck in the mud, they desert you.'
24Jr 38:23 All your wives and your children shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire."
24Jr 38:24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do not let anyone else know of this conversation, or you will die.
24Jr 38:25 If the officials should hear that I have spoken with you, and they should come and say to you, 'Just tell us what you said to the king; do not conceal it from us, or we will put you to death. What did the king say to you?'
24Jr 38:26 then you shall say to them, 'I was presenting my plea to the king not to send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
24Jr 38:27 All the officials did come to Jeremiah and questioned him; and he answered them in the very words the king had commanded. So they stopped questioning him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
24Jr 38:28 And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
24Jr 39:1 In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it;
24Jr 39:2 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
24Jr 39:3 When Jerusalem was taken, all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 39:4 When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah.
24Jr 39:5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him.
24Jr 39:6 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; also the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
24Jr 39:7 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon.
24Jr 39:8 The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24Jr 39:9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard exiled to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
24Jr 39:10 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
24Jr 39:11 King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
24Jr 39:12 "Take him, look after him well and do him no harm, but deal with him as he may ask you."
24Jr 39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon sent
24Jr 39:14 and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan to be brought home. So he stayed with his own people.
24Jr 39:15 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guard:
24Jr 39:16 Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian: Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to fulfill my words against this city for evil and not for good, and they shall be accomplished in your presence on that day.
24Jr 39:17 But I will save you on that day, says the LORD, and you shall not be handed over to those whom you dread.
24Jr 39:18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have trusted in me, says the LORD.
24Jr 40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in fetters along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
24Jr 40:2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God threatened this place with this disaster;
24Jr 40:3 and now the LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said, because all of you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice. Therefore this thing has come upon you.
24Jr 40:4 Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you; but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.
24Jr 40:5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go." So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.
24Jr 40:6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
24Jr 40:7 When all the leaders of the forces in the open country and their troops heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,
24Jr 40:8 they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their troops.
24Jr 40:9 Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan swore to them and their troops, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall go well with you.
24Jr 40:10 As for me, I am staying at Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and live in the towns that you have taken over."
24Jr 40:11 Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor over them,
24Jr 40:12 then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah; and they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
24Jr 40:13 Now Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24Jr 40:14 and said to him, "Are you at all aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.
24Jr 40:15 Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, "Please let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one else will know. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered around you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?"
24Jr 40:16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Do not do such a thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael."
24Jr 41:1 In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,
24Jr 41:2 Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, because the king of Babylon had appointed him governor in the land.
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
24Jr 41:4 On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
24Jr 41:5 eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 41:6 And Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam."
24Jr 41:7 When they reached the middle of the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them, and threw them into a cistern.
24Jr 41:8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not kill us, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields." So he refrained, and did not kill them along with their companions.
24Jr 41:9 Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against King Baasha of Israel; Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled that cistern with those whom he had killed.
24Jr 41:10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:11 But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the crimes that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,
24Jr 41:12 they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
24Jr 41:13 And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they were glad.
24Jr 41:14 So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan son of Kareah.
24Jr 41:15 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:16 Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael son of Nethaniah had carried away captive from Mizpah after he had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam--soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon.
24Jr 41:17 And they set out, and stopped at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
24Jr 41:18 because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
24Jr 42:1 Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached
24Jr 42:2 the prophet Jeremiah and said, "Be good enough to listen to our plea, and pray to the LORD your God for us--for all this remnant. For there are only a few of us left out of many, as your eyes can see.
24Jr 42:3 Let the LORD your God show us where we should go and what we should do."
24Jr 42:4 The prophet Jeremiah said to them, "Very well: I am going to pray to the LORD your God as you request, and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you; I will keep nothing back from you."
24Jr 42:5 They in their turn said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to everything that the LORD your God sends us through you.
24Jr 42:6 Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, in order that it may go well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."
24Jr 42:7 At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
24Jr 42:8 Then he summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
24Jr 42:9 and said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea before him:
24Jr 42:10 If you will only remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I am sorry for the disaster that I have brought upon you.
24Jr 42:11 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, as you have been; do not be afraid of him, says the LORD, for I am with you, to save you and to rescue you from his hand.
24Jr 42:12 I will grant you mercy, and he will have mercy on you and restore you to your native soil.
24Jr 42:13 But if you continue to say, 'We will not stay in this land,' thus disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
24Jr 42:14 and saying, 'No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war, or hear the sound of the trumpet, or be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,'
24Jr 42:15 then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you are determined to enter Egypt and go to settle there,
24Jr 42:16 then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there, in the land of Egypt; and the famine that you dread shall follow close after you into Egypt; and there you shall die.
24Jr 42:17 All the people who have determined to go to Egypt to settle there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I am bringing upon them.
24Jr 42:18 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Just as my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an object of execration and horror, of cursing and ridicule. You shall see this place no more.
24Jr 42:19 The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, Do not go to Egypt. Be well aware that I have warned you today
24Jr 42:20 that you have made a fatal mistake. For you yourselves sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us and we will do it.'
24Jr 42:21 So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you.
24Jr 42:22 Be well aware, then, that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go and settle."
24Jr 43:1 When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the LORD their God, with which the LORD their God had sent him to them,
24Jr 43:2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie. The LORD our God did not send you to say, 'Do not go to Egypt to settle there';
24Jr 43:3 but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon."
24Jr 43:4 So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to stay in the land of Judah.
24Jr 43:5 But Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to settle in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven--
24Jr 43:6 the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan; also the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah.
24Jr 43:7 And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they arrived at Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
24Jr 43:9 Take some large stones in your hands, and bury them in the clay pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes. Let the Judeans see you do it,
24Jr 43:10 and say to them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to send and take my servant King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he will set his throne above these stones that I have buried, and he will spread his royal canopy over them.
24Jr 43:11 He shall come and ravage the land of Egypt, giving those who are destined for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are destined for captivity, to captivity, and those who are destined for the sword, to the sword.
24Jr 43:12 He shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them and carry them away captive; and he shall pick clean the land of Egypt, as a shepherd picks his cloak clean of vermin; and he shall depart from there safely.
24Jr 43:13 He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.
24Jr 44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Judeans living in the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros,
24Jr 44:2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Look at them; today they are a desolation, without an inhabitant in them,
24Jr 44:3 because of the wickedness that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they had not known, neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors.
24Jr 44:4 Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, "I beg you not to do this abominable thing that I hate!"
24Jr 44:5 But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their wickedness and make no offerings to other gods.
24Jr 44:6 So my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a waste and a desolation, as they still are today.
24Jr 44:7 And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves, to cut off man and woman, child and infant, from the midst of Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant?
24Jr 44:8 Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to settle? Will you be cut off and become an object of cursing and ridicule among all the nations of the earth?
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten the crimes of your ancestors, of the kings of Judah, of their wives, your own crimes and those of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 44:10 They have shown no contrition or fear to this day, nor have they walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your ancestors.
24Jr 44:11 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am determined to bring disaster on you, to bring all Judah to an end.
24Jr 44:12 I will take the remnant of Judah who are determined to come to the land of Egypt to settle, and they shall perish, everyone; in the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall perish; from the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine; and they shall become an object of execration and horror, of cursing and ridicule.
24Jr 44:13 I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
24Jr 44:14 so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to settle in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah. Although they long to go back to live there, they shall not go back, except some fugitives.
24Jr 44:15 Then all the men who were aware that their wives had been making offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
24Jr 44:16 "As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you.
24Jr 44:17 Instead, we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials, used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. We used to have plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no misfortune.
24Jr 44:18 But from the time we stopped making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have perished by the sword and by famine."
24Jr 44:19 And the women said, "Indeed we will go on making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her; do you think that we made cakes for her, marked with her image, and poured out libations to her without our husbands' being involved?"
24Jr 44:20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who were giving him this answer:
24Jr 44:21 "As for the offerings that you made in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind?
24Jr 44:22 The LORD could no longer bear the sight of your evil doings, the abominations that you committed; therefore your land became a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is to this day.
24Jr 44:23 It is because you burned offerings, and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his decrees, that this disaster has befallen you, as is still evident today."
24Jr 44:24 Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you Judeans who are in the land of Egypt,
24Jr 44:25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have accomplished in deeds what you declared in words, saying, 'We are determined to perform the vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out libations to her.' By all means, keep your vows and make your libations!
24Jr 44:26 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you Judeans who live in the land of Egypt: Lo, I swear by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no longer be pronounced on the lips of any of the people of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, 'As the Lord GOD lives.'
24Jr 44:27 I am going to watch over them for harm and not for good; all the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left.
24Jr 44:28 And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have come to the land of Egypt to settle, shall know whose words will stand, mine or theirs!
24Jr 44:29 This shall be the sign to you, says the LORD, that I am going to punish you in this place, in order that you may know that my words against you will surely be carried out:
24Jr 44:30 Thus says the LORD, I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies, those who seek his life, just as I gave King Zedekiah of Judah into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life."
24Jr 45:1 The word that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:
24Jr 45:2 Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
24Jr 45:3 You said, "Woe is me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest."
24Jr 45:4 Thus you shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: I am going to break down what I have built, and pluck up what I have planted--that is, the whole land.
24Jr 45:5 And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am going to bring disaster upon all flesh, says the LORD; but I will give you your life as a prize of war in every place to which you may go."
24Jr 46:1 The word of the LORD that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the nations.
24Jr 46:2 Concerning Egypt, about the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:
24Jr 46:3 Prepare buckler and shield, and advance for battle!
24Jr 46:4 Harness the horses; mount the steeds! Take your stations with your helmets, whet your lances, put on your coats of mail!
24Jr 46:5 Why do I see them terrified? They have fallen back; their warriors are beaten down, and have fled in haste. They do not look back--terror is all around! says the LORD.
24Jr 46:6 The swift cannot flee away, nor can the warrior escape; in the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.
24Jr 46:7 Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge?
24Jr 46:8 Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge. It said, Let me rise, let me cover the earth, let me destroy cities and their inhabitants.
24Jr 46:9 Advance, O horses, and dash madly, O chariots! Let the warriors go forth: Ethiopia and Put who carry the shield, the Ludim, who draw the bow.
24Jr 46:10 That day is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of retribution, to gain vindication from his foes. The sword shall devour and be sated, and drink its fill of their blood. For the Lord GOD of hosts holds a sacrifice in the land of the north by the river Euphrates.
24Jr 46:11 Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you.
24Jr 46:12 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for warrior has stumbled against warrior; both have fallen together.
24Jr 46:13 The word that the LORD spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about the coming of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon to attack the land of Egypt:
24Jr 46:14 Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol; proclaim in Memphis and Tahpanhes; Say, "Take your stations and be ready, for the sword shall devour those around you."
24Jr 46:15 Why has Apis fled? Why did your bull not stand? --because the LORD thrust him down.
24Jr 46:16 Your multitude stumbled and fell, and one said to another, "Come, let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, because of the destroying sword."
24Jr 46:17 Give Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the name "Braggart who missed his chance."
24Jr 46:18 As I live, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, one is coming like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea.
24Jr 46:19 Pack your bags for exile, sheltered daughter Egypt! For Memphis shall become a waste, a ruin, without inhabitant.
24Jr 46:20 A beautiful heifer is Egypt--a gadfly from the north lights upon her.
24Jr 46:21 Even her mercenaries in her midst are like fatted calves; they too have turned and fled together, they did not stand; for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 46:22 She makes a sound like a snake gliding away; for her enemies march in force, and come against her with axes, like those who fell trees.
24Jr 46:23 They shall cut down her forest, says the LORD, though it is impenetrable, because they are more numerous than locusts; they are without number.
24Jr 46:24 Daughter Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be handed over to a people from the north.
24Jr 46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said: See, I am bringing punishment upon Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh, and Egypt and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
24Jr 46:26 I will hand them over to those who seek their life, to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and his officers. Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in the days of old, says the LORD.
24Jr 46:27 But as for you, have no fear, my servant Jacob, and do not be dismayed, O Israel; for I am going to save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and no one shall make him afraid.
24Jr 46:28 As for you, have no fear, my servant Jacob, says the LORD, for I am with you. I will make an end of all the nations among which I have banished you, but I will not make an end of you! I will chastise you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
24Jr 47:1 The word of the LORD that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
24Jr 47:2 Thus says the LORD: See, waters are rising out of the north and shall become an overflowing torrent; they shall overflow the land and all that fills it, the city and those who live in it. People shall cry out, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
24Jr 47:3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, at the clatter of his chariots, at the rumbling of their wheels, parents do not turn back for children, so feeble are their hands,
24Jr 47:4 because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remains. For the LORD is destroying the Philistines, the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
24Jr 47:5 Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is silenced. O remnant of their power! How long will you gash yourselves?
24Jr 47:6 Ah, sword of the LORD! How long until you are quiet? Put yourself into your scabbard, rest and be still!
24Jr 47:7 How can it be quiet, when the LORD has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the seashore--there he has appointed it.
24Jr 48:1 Concerning Moab. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Alas for Nebo, it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; the fortress is put to shame and broken down;
24Jr 48:2 the renown of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they planned evil against her: "Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!" You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.
24Jr 48:3 Hark! a cry from Horonaim, "Desolation and great destruction!"
24Jr 48:4 "Moab is destroyed!" her little ones cry out.
24Jr 48:5 For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping bitterly; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distressing cry of anguish.
24Jr 48:6 Flee! Save yourselves! Be like a wild ass in the desert!
24Jr 48:7 Surely, because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you also shall be taken; Chemosh shall go out into exile, with his priests and his attendants.
24Jr 48:8 The destroyer shall come upon every town, and no town shall escape; the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.
24Jr 48:9 Set aside salt for Moab, for she will surely fall; her towns shall become a desolation, with no inhabitant in them.
24Jr 48:10 Accursed is the one who is slack in doing the work of the LORD; and accursed is the one who keeps back the sword from bloodshed.
24Jr 48:11 Moab has been at ease from his youth, settled like wine on its dregs; he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into exile; therefore his flavor has remained and his aroma is unspoiled.
24Jr 48:12 Therefore, the time is surely coming, says the LORD, when I shall send to him decanters to decant him, and empty his vessels, and break his jars in pieces.
24Jr 48:13 Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
24Jr 48:14 How can you say, "We are heroes and mighty warriors"?
24Jr 48:15 The destroyer of Moab and his towns has come up, and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 48:16 The calamity of Moab is near at hand and his doom approaches swiftly.
24Jr 48:17 Mourn over him, all you his neighbors, and all who know his name; say, "How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff!"
24Jr 48:18 Come down from glory, and sit on the parched ground, enthroned daughter Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; he has destroyed your strongholds.
24Jr 48:19 Stand by the road and watch, you inhabitant of Aroer! Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping; say, "What has happened?"
24Jr 48:20 Moab is put to shame, for it is broken down; wail and cry! Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
24Jr 48:21 Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mephaath,
24Jr 48:22 and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
24Jr 48:23 and Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,
24Jr 48:24 and Kerioth, and Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near.
24Jr 48:25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the LORD.
24Jr 48:26 Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the LORD; let Moab wallow in his vomit; he too shall become a laughingstock.
24Jr 48:27 Israel was a laughingstock for you, though he was not caught among thieves; but whenever you spoke of him you shook your head!
24Jr 48:28 Leave the towns, and live on the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like the dove that nests on the sides of the mouth of a gorge.
24Jr 48:29 We have heard of the pride of Moab--he is very proud--of his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
24Jr 48:30 I myself know his insolence, says the LORD; his boasts are false, his deeds are false.
24Jr 48:31 Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for all Moab; for the people of Kir-heres I mourn.
24Jr 48:32 More than for Jazer I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches crossed over the sea, reached as far as Jazer; upon your summer fruits and your vintage the destroyer has fallen.
24Jr 48:33 Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of Moab; I have stopped the wine from the wine presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy; the shouting is not the shout of joy.
24Jr 48:34 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. For even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.
24Jr 48:35 And I will bring to an end in Moab, says the LORD, those who offer sacrifice at a high place and make offerings to their gods.
24Jr 48:36 Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the people of Kir-heres; for the riches they gained have perished.
24Jr 48:37 For every head is shaved and every beard cut off; on all the hands there are gashes, and on the loins sackcloth.
24Jr 48:38 On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel that no one wants, says the LORD.
24Jr 48:39 How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all his neighbors.
24Jr 48:40 For thus says the LORD: Look, he shall swoop down like an eagle, and spread his wings against Moab;
24Jr 48:41 the towns shall be taken and the strongholds seized. The hearts of the warriors of Moab, on that day, shall be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24Jr 48:42 Moab shall be destroyed as a people, because he magnified himself against the LORD.
24Jr 48:43 Terror, pit, and trap are before you, O inhabitants of Moab! says the LORD.
24Jr 48:44 Everyone who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and everyone who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the trap. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.
24Jr 48:45 In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop exhausted; for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the house of Sihon; it has destroyed the forehead of Moab, the scalp of the people of tumult.
24Jr 48:46 Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished, for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.
24Jr 48:47 Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the LORD. Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
24Jr 49:1 Concerning the Ammonites. Thus says the LORD: Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad, and his people settled in its towns?
24Jr 49:2 Therefore, the time is surely coming, says the LORD, when I will sound the battle alarm against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it shall become a desolate mound, and its villages shall be burned with fire; then Israel shall dispossess those who dispossessed him, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:3 Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste! Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth, lament, and slash yourselves with whips! For Milcom shall go into exile, with his priests and his attendants.
24Jr 49:4 Why do you boast in your strength? Your strength is ebbing, O faithless daughter. You trusted in your treasures, saying, "Who will attack me?"
24Jr 49:5 I am going to bring terror upon you, says the Lord GOD of hosts, from all your neighbors, and you will be scattered, each headlong, with no one to gather the fugitives.
24Jr 49:6 But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:7 Concerning Edom. Thus says the LORD of hosts: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?
24Jr 49:8 Flee, turn back, get down low, inhabitants of Dedan! For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time when I punish him.
24Jr 49:9 If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves came by night, even they would pillage only what they wanted.
24Jr 49:10 But as for me, I have stripped Esau bare, I have uncovered his hiding places, and he is not able to conceal himself. His offspring are destroyed, his kinsfolk and his neighbors; and he is no more.
24Jr 49:11 Leave your orphans, I will keep them alive; and let your widows trust in me.
24Jr 49:12 For thus says the LORD: If those who do not deserve to drink the cup still have to drink it, shall you be the one to go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished; you must drink it.
24Jr 49:13 For by myself I have sworn, says the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an object of horror and ridicule, a waste, and an object of cursing; and all her towns shall be perpetual wastes.
24Jr 49:14 I have heard tidings from the LORD, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: "Gather yourselves together and come against her, and rise up for battle!"
24Jr 49:15 For I will make you least among the nations, despised by humankind.
24Jr 49:16 The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill. Although you make your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:17 Edom shall become an object of horror; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters.
24Jr 49:18 As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors were overthrown, says the LORD, no one shall live there, nor shall anyone settle in it.
24Jr 49:19 Like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly chase Edom away from it; and I will appoint over it whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who can summon me? Who is the shepherd who can stand before me?
24Jr 49:20 Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
24Jr 49:21 At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble; the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea.
24Jr 49:22 Look, he shall mount up and swoop down like an eagle, and spread his wings against Bozrah, and the heart of the warriors of Edom in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath and Arpad are confounded, for they have heard bad news; they melt in fear, they are troubled like the sea that cannot be quiet.
24Jr 49:24 Damascus has become feeble, she turned to flee, and panic seized her; anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:25 How the famous city is forsaken, the joyful town!
24Jr 49:26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day, says the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 49:27 And I will kindle a fire at the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.
24Jr 49:28 Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon defeated. Thus says the LORD: Rise up, advance against Kedar! Destroy the people of the east!
24Jr 49:29 Take their tents and their flocks, their curtains and all their goods; carry off their camels for yourselves, and a cry shall go up: "Terror is all around!"
24Jr 49:30 Flee, wander far away, hide in deep places, O inhabitants of Hazor! says the LORD. For King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has made a plan against you and formed a purpose against you.
24Jr 49:31 Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, that lives secure, says the LORD, that has no gates or bars, that lives alone.
24Jr 49:32 Their camels shall become booty, their herds of cattle a spoil. I will scatter to every wind those who have shaven temples, and I will bring calamity against them from every side, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:33 Hazor shall become a lair of jackals, an everlasting waste; no one shall live there, nor shall anyone settle in it.
24Jr 49:34 The word of the LORD that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning Elam, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah.
24Jr 49:35 Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am going to break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might;
24Jr 49:36 and I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven; and I will scatter them to all these winds, and there shall be no nation to which the exiles from Elam shall not come.
24Jr 49:37 I will terrify Elam before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; I will bring disaster upon them, my fierce anger, says the LORD. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;
24Jr 49:38 and I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy their king and officials, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:39 But in the latter days I will restore the fortunes of Elam, says the LORD.
24Jr 50:1 The word that the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the prophet Jeremiah:
24Jr 50:2 Declare among the nations and proclaim, set up a banner and proclaim, do not conceal it, say: Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed. Her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.
24Jr 50:3 For out of the north a nation has come up against her; it shall make her land a desolation, and no one shall live in it; both human beings and animals shall flee away.
24Jr 50:4 In those days and in that time, says the LORD, the people of Israel shall come, they and the people of Judah together; they shall come weeping as they seek the LORD their God.
24Jr 50:5 They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, and they shall come and join themselves to the LORD by an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
24Jr 50:6 My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the mountains; from mountain to hill they have gone, they have forgotten their fold.
24Jr 50:7 All who found them have devoured them, and their enemies have said, "We are not guilty, because they have sinned against the LORD, the true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their ancestors."
24Jr 50:8 Flee from Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like male goats leading the flock.
24Jr 50:9 For I am going to stir up and bring against Babylon a company of great nations from the land of the north; and they shall array themselves against her; from there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like the arrows of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
24Jr 50:10 Chaldea shall be plundered; all who plunder her shall be sated, says the LORD.
24Jr 50:11 Though you rejoice, though you exult, O plunderers of my heritage, though you frisk about like a heifer on the grass, and neigh like stallions,
24Jr 50:12 your mother shall be utterly shamed, and she who bore you shall be disgraced. Lo, she shall be the last of the nations, a wilderness, dry land, and a desert.
24Jr 50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD she shall not be inhabited, but shall be an utter desolation; everyone who passes by Babylon shall be appalled and hiss because of all her wounds.
24Jr 50:14 Take up your positions around Babylon, all you that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 50:15 Raise a shout against her from all sides, "She has surrendered; her bulwarks have fallen, her walls are thrown down." For this is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her, do to her as she has done.
24Jr 50:16 Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the wielder of the sickle in time of harvest; because of the destroying sword all of them shall return to their own people, and all of them shall flee to their own land.
24Jr 50:17 Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured it, and now at the end King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has gnawed its bones.
24Jr 50:18 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.
24Jr 50:19 I will restore Israel to its pasture, and it shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead its hunger shall be satisfied.
24Jr 50:20 In those days and at that time, says the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and none shall be found; for I will pardon the remnant that I have spared.
24Jr 50:21 Go up to the land of Merathaim; go up against her, and attack the inhabitants of Pekod and utterly destroy the last of them, says the LORD; do all that I have commanded you.
24Jr 50:22 The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction!
24Jr 50:23 How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
24Jr 50:24 You set a snare for yourself and you were caught, O Babylon, but you did not know it; you were discovered and seized, because you challenged the LORD.
24Jr 50:25 The LORD has opened his armory, and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a task to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 50:26 Come against her from every quarter; open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain, and destroy her utterly; let nothing be left of her.
24Jr 50:27 Kill all her bulls, let them go down to the slaughter. Alas for them, their day has come, the time of their punishment!
24Jr 50:28 Listen! Fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon are coming to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 50:29 Summon archers against Babylon, all who bend the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; just as she has done, do to her--for she has arrogantly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 50:30 Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, says the LORD.
24Jr 50:31 I am against you, O arrogant one, says the Lord GOD of hosts; for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
24Jr 50:32 The arrogant one shall stumble and fall, with no one to raise him up, and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour everything around him.
24Jr 50:33 Thus says the LORD of hosts: The people of Israel are oppressed, and so too are the people of Judah; all their captors have held them fast and refuse to let them go.
24Jr 50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will surely plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 50:35 A sword against the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her officials and her sages!
24Jr 50:36 A sword against the diviners, so that they may become fools! A sword against her warriors, so that they may be destroyed!
24Jr 50:37 A sword against her horses and against her chariots, and against all the foreign troops in her midst, so that they may become women! A sword against all her treasures, that they may be plundered!
24Jr 50:38 A drought against her waters, that they may be dried up! For it is a land of images, and they go mad over idols.
24Jr 50:39 Therefore wild animals shall live with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall inhabit her; she shall never again be peopled, or inhabited for all generations.
24Jr 50:40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says the LORD, so no one shall live there, nor shall anyone settle in her.
24Jr 50:41 Look, a people is coming from the north; a mighty nation and many kings are stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
24Jr 50:42 They wield bow and spear, they are cruel and have no mercy. The sound of them is like the roaring sea; they ride upon horses, set in array as a warrior for battle, against you, O daughter Babylon!
24Jr 50:43 The king of Babylon heard news of them, and his hands fell helpless; anguish seized him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24Jr 50:44 Like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly chase them away from her; and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who can summon me? Who is the shepherd who can stand before me?
24Jr 50:45 Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Babylon, and the purposes that he has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
24Jr 50:46 At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations.
24Jr 51:1 Thus says the LORD: I am going to stir up a destructive wind against Babylon and against the inhabitants of Leb-qamai;
24Jr 51:2 and I will send winnowers to Babylon, and they shall winnow her. They shall empty her land when they come against her from every side on the day of trouble.
24Jr 51:3 Let not the archer bend his bow, and let him not array himself in his coat of mail. Do not spare her young men; utterly destroy her entire army.
24Jr 51:4 They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and wounded in her streets.
24Jr 51:5 Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD of hosts, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 51:6 Flee from the midst of Babylon, save your lives, each of you! Do not perish because of her guilt, for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he is repaying her what is due.
24Jr 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine, and so the nations went mad.
24Jr 51:8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and is shattered; wail for her! Bring balm for her wound; perhaps she may be healed.
24Jr 51:9 We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed. Forsake her, and let each of us go to our own country; for her judgment has reached up to heaven and has been lifted up even to the skies.
24Jr 51:10 The LORD has brought forth our vindication; come, let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
24Jr 51:11 Sharpen the arrows! Fill the quivers! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 51:12 Raise a standard against the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; post sentinels; prepare the ambushes; for the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 51:13 You who live by mighty waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the thread of your life is cut.
24Jr 51:14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself: Surely I will fill you with troops like a swarm of locusts, and they shall raise a shout of victory over you.
24Jr 51:15 It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 51:16 When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain, and he brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 51:17 Everyone is stupid and without knowledge; goldsmiths are all put to shame by their idols; for their images are false, and there is no breath in them.
24Jr 51:18 They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
24Jr 51:19 Not like these is the LORD, the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.
24Jr 51:20 You are my war club, my weapon of battle: with you I smash nations; with you I destroy kingdoms;
24Jr 51:21 with you I smash the horse and its rider; with you I smash the chariot and the charioteer;
24Jr 51:22 with you I smash man and woman; with you I smash the old man and the boy; with you I smash the young man and the girl;
24Jr 51:23 with you I smash shepherds and their flocks; with you I smash farmers and their teams; with you I smash governors and deputies.
24Jr 51:24 I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the wrong that they have done in Zion, says the LORD.
24Jr 51:25 I am against you, O destroying mountain, says the LORD, that destroys the whole earth; I will stretch out my hand against you, and roll you down from the crags, and make you a burned-out mountain.
24Jr 51:26 No stone shall be taken from you for a corner and no stone for a foundation, but you shall be a perpetual waste, says the LORD.
24Jr 51:27 Raise a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations for war against her, summon against her the kingdoms, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a marshal against her, bring up horses like bristling locusts.
24Jr 51:28 Prepare the nations for war against her, the kings of the Medes, with their governors and deputies, and every land under their dominion.
24Jr 51:29 The land trembles and writhes, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
24Jr 51:30 The warriors of Babylon have given up fighting, they remain in their strongholds; their strength has failed, they have become women; her buildings are set on fire, her bars are broken.
24Jr 51:31 One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end:
24Jr 51:32 the fords have been seized, the marshes have been burned with fire, and the soldiers are in panic.
24Jr 51:33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while and the time of her harvest will come.
24Jr 51:34 "King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me like a monster; he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has spewed me out.
24Jr 51:35 May my torn flesh be avenged on Babylon," the inhabitants of Zion shall say. "May my blood be avenged on the inhabitants of Chaldea," Jerusalem shall say.
24Jr 51:36 Therefore thus says the LORD: I am going to defend your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry;
24Jr 51:37 and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins, a den of jackals, an object of horror and of hissing, without inhabitant.
24Jr 51:38 Like lions they shall roar together; they shall growl like lions' whelps.
24Jr 51:39 When they are inflamed, I will set out their drink and make them drunk, until they become merry and then sleep a perpetual sleep and never wake, says the LORD.
24Jr 51:40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats.
24Jr 51:41 How Sheshach is taken, the pride of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!
24Jr 51:42 The sea has risen over Babylon; she has been covered by its tumultuous waves.
24Jr 51:43 Her cities have become an object of horror, a land of drought and a desert, a land in which no one lives, and through which no mortal passes.
24Jr 51:44 I will punish Bel in Babylon, and make him disgorge what he has swallowed. The nations shall no longer stream to him; the wall of Babylon has fallen.
24Jr 51:45 Come out of her, my people! Save your lives, each of you, from the fierce anger of the LORD!
24Jr 51:46 Do not be faint-hearted or fearful at the rumors heard in the land--one year one rumor comes, the next year another, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.
24Jr 51:47 Assuredly, the days are coming when I will punish the images of Babylon; her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.
24Jr 51:48 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall shout for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north, says the LORD.
24Jr 51:49 Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel, as the slain of all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
24Jr 51:50 You survivors of the sword, go, do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and let Jerusalem come into your mind:
24Jr 51:51 We are put to shame, for we have heard insults; dishonor has covered our face, for aliens have come into the holy places of the LORD's house.
24Jr 51:52 Therefore the time is surely coming, says the LORD, when I will punish her idols, and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
24Jr 51:53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strong height, from me destroyers would come upon her, says the LORD.
24Jr 51:54 Listen!--a cry from Babylon! A great crashing from the land of the Chaldeans!
24Jr 51:55 For the LORD is laying Babylon waste, and stilling her loud clamor. Their waves roar like mighty waters, the sound of their clamor resounds;
24Jr 51:56 for a destroyer has come against her, against Babylon; her warriors are taken, their bows are broken; for the LORD is a God of recompense, he will repay in full.
24Jr 51:57 I will make her officials and her sages drunk, also her governors, her deputies, and her warriors; they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and never wake, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24Jr 51:58 Thus says the LORD of hosts: The broad wall of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground, and her high gates shall be burned with fire. The peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, and the nations weary themselves only for fire.
24Jr 51:59 The word that the prophet Jeremiah commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, when he went with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.
24Jr 51:60 Jeremiah wrote in a scroll all the disasters that would come on Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
24Jr 51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: "When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
24Jr 51:62 and say, 'O LORD, you yourself threatened to destroy this place so that neither human beings nor animals shall live in it, and it shall be desolate forever.'
24Jr 51:63 When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it, and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,
24Jr 51:64 and say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disasters that I am bringing on her.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24Jr 52:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
24Jr 52:3 Indeed, Jerusalem and Judah so angered the LORD that he expelled them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24Jr 52:4 And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it; they built siegeworks against it all around.
24Jr 52:5 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
24Jr 52:6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine became so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
24Jr 52:7 Then a breach was made in the city wall; and all the soldiers fled and went out from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They went in the direction of the Arabah.
24Jr 52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered, deserting him.
24Jr 52:9 Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
24Jr 52:10 The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also killed all the officers of Judah at Riblah.
24Jr 52:11 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.
24Jr 52:12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month--which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon--Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:13 He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
24Jr 52:14 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:15 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
24Jr 52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and tillers of the soil.
24Jr 52:17 The pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24Jr 52:18 They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the ladles, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service.
24Jr 52:19 The captain of the guard took away the small bowls also, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the ladles, and the bowls for libation, both those of gold and those of silver.
24Jr 52:20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weighing.
24Jr 52:21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits; it was hollow and its thickness was four fingers.
24Jr 52:22 Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the one capital was five cubits; latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, encircled the top of the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates.
24Jr 52:23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates encircling the latticework numbered one hundred.
24Jr 52:24 The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah, the second priest Zephaniah, and the three guardians of the threshold;
24Jr 52:25 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the soldiers, and seven men of the king's council who were found in the city; the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found inside the city.
24Jr 52:26 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24Jr 52:27 And the king of Babylon struck them down, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile out of its land.
24Jr 52:28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrezzar took into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans;
24Jr 52:29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he took into exile from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;
24Jr 52:30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took into exile of the Judeans seven hundred forty-five persons; all the persons were four thousand six hundred.
24Jr 52:31 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year he began to reign, showed favor to King Jehoiachin of Judah and brought him out of prison;
24Jr 52:32 he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
24Jr 52:33 So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes, and every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table.
24Jr 52:34 For his allowance, a regular daily allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, as long as he lived, up to the day of his death.

25Lm 1:1 How lonely sits the city that once was full of people! How like a widow she has become, she that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces has become a vassal.
25Lm 1:2 She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.
25Lm 1:3 Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude; she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place; her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
25Lm 1:4 The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan; her young girls grieve, and her lot is bitter.
25Lm 1:5 Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper, because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe.
25Lm 1:6 From daughter Zion has departed all her majesty. Her princes have become like stags that find no pasture; they fled without strength before the pursuer.
25Lm 1:7 Jerusalem remembers, in the days of her affliction and wandering, all the precious things that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was no one to help her, the foe looked on mocking over her downfall.
25Lm 1:8 Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she has become a mockery; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans, and turns her face away.
25Lm 1:9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she took no thought of her future; her downfall was appalling, with none to comfort her. "O LORD, look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!"
25Lm 1:10 Enemies have stretched out their hands over all her precious things; she has even seen the nations invade her sanctuary, those whom you forbade to enter your congregation.
25Lm 1:11 All her people groan as they search for bread; they trade their treasures for food to revive their strength. Look, O LORD, and see how worthless I have become.
25Lm 1:12 Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was brought upon me, which the LORD inflicted on the day of his fierce anger.
25Lm 1:13 From on high he sent fire; it went deep into my bones; he spread a net for my feet; he turned me back; he has left me stunned, faint all day long.
25Lm 1:14 My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together; they weigh on my neck, sapping my strength; the Lord handed me over to those whom I cannot withstand.
25Lm 1:15 The LORD has rejected all my warriors in the midst of me; he proclaimed a time against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter Judah.
25Lm 1:16 For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my courage; my children are desolate, for the enemy has prevailed.
25Lm 1:17 Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her; the LORD has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors should become his foes; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them.
25Lm 1:18 The LORD is in the right, for I have rebelled against his word; but hear, all you peoples, and behold my suffering; my young women and young men have gone into captivity.
25Lm 1:19 I called to my lovers but they deceived me; my priests and elders perished in the city while seeking food to revive their strength.
25Lm 1:20 See, O LORD, how distressed I am; my stomach churns, my heart is wrung within me, because I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword bereaves; in the house it is like death.
25Lm 1:21 They heard how I was groaning, with no one to comfort me. All my enemies heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it. Bring on the day you have announced, and let them be as I am.
25Lm 1:22 Let all their evil doing come before you; and deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions; for my groans are many and my heart is faint.
25Lm 2:1 How the Lord in his anger has humiliated daughter Zion! He has thrown down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
25Lm 2:2 The Lord has destroyed without mercy all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has broken down the strongholds of daughter Judah; he has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its rulers.
25Lm 2:3 He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn his right hand from them in the face of the enemy; he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob, consuming all around.
25Lm 2:4 He has bent his bow like an enemy, with his right hand set like a foe; he has killed all in whom we took pride in the tent of daughter Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire.
25Lm 2:5 The Lord has become like an enemy; he has destroyed Israel; He has destroyed all its palaces, laid in ruins its strongholds, and multiplied in daughter Judah mourning and lamentation.
25Lm 2:6 He has broken down his booth like a garden, he has destroyed his tabernacle; the LORD has abolished in Zion festival and sabbath, and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest.
25Lm 2:7 The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary; he has delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; a clamor was raised in the house of the LORD as on a day of festival.
25Lm 2:8 The LORD determined to lay in ruins the wall of daughter Zion; he stretched the line; he did not withhold his hand from destroying; he caused rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
25Lm 2:9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken her bars; her king and princes are among the nations; guidance is no more, and her prophets obtain no vision from the LORD.
25Lm 2:10 The elders of daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth; the young girls of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
25Lm 2:11 My eyes are spent with weeping; my stomach churns; my bile is poured out on the ground because of the destruction of my people, because infants and babes faint in the streets of the city.
25Lm 2:12 They cry to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their life is poured out on their mothers' bosom.
25Lm 2:13 What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter Zion? For vast as the sea is your ruin; who can heal you?
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but have seen oracles for you that are false and misleading.
25Lm 2:15 All who pass along the way clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at daughter Jerusalem; "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?"
25Lm 2:16 All your enemies open their mouths against you; they hiss, they gnash their teeth, they cry: "We have devoured her! Ah, this is the day we longed for; at last we have seen it!"
25Lm 2:17 The LORD has done what he purposed, he has carried out his threat; as he ordained long ago, he has demolished without pity; he has made the enemy rejoice over you, and exalted the might of your foes.
25Lm 2:18 Cry aloud to the Lord! O wall of daughter Zion! Let tears stream down like a torrent day and night! Give yourself no rest, your eyes no respite!
25Lm 2:19 Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord! Lift your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint for hunger at the head of every street.
25Lm 2:20 Look, O LORD, and consider! To whom have you done this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have borne? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
25Lm 2:21 The young and the old are lying on the ground in the streets; my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword; in the day of your anger you have killed them, slaughtering without mercy.
25Lm 2:22 You invited my enemies from all around as if for a day of festival; and on the day of the anger of the LORD no one escaped or survived; those whom I bore and reared my enemy has destroyed.
25Lm 3:1 I am one who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath;
25Lm 3:2 he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;
25Lm 3:3 against me alone he turns his hand, again and again, all day long.
25Lm 3:4 He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones;
25Lm 3:5 he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;
25Lm 3:6 he has made me sit in darkness like the dead of long ago.
25Lm 3:7 He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me;
25Lm 3:8 though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;
25Lm 3:9 he has blocked my ways with hewn stones, he has made my paths crooked.
25Lm 3:10 He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;
25Lm 3:11 he led me off my way and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;
25Lm 3:12 he bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrow.
25Lm 3:13 He shot into my vitals the arrows of his quiver;
25Lm 3:14 I have become the laughingstock of all my people, the object of their taunt-songs all day long.
25Lm 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.
25Lm 3:16 He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;
25Lm 3:17 my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;
25Lm 3:18 so I say, "Gone is my glory, and all that I had hoped for from the LORD."
25Lm 3:19 The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!
25Lm 3:20 My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.
25Lm 3:21 But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:
25Lm 3:22 The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;
25Lm 3:23 they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
25Lm 3:24 "The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."
25Lm 3:25 The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
25Lm 3:26 It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
25Lm 3:27 It is good for one to bear the yoke in youth,
25Lm 3:28 to sit alone in silence when the Lord has imposed it,
25Lm 3:29 to put one's mouth to the dust (there may yet be hope),
25Lm 3:30 to give one's cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults.
25Lm 3:31 For the Lord will not reject forever.
25Lm 3:32 Although he causes grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;
25Lm 3:33 for he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.
25Lm 3:34 When all the prisoners of the land are crushed under foot,
25Lm 3:35 when human rights are perverted in the presence of the Most High,
25Lm 3:36 when one's case is subverted--does the Lord not see it?
25Lm 3:37 Who can command and have it done, if the Lord has not ordained it?
25Lm 3:38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?
25Lm 3:39 Why should any who draw breath complain about the punishment of their sins?
25Lm 3:40 Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD.
25Lm 3:41 Let us lift up our hearts as well as our hands to God in heaven.
25Lm 3:42 We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.
25Lm 3:43 You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;
25Lm 3:44 you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
25Lm 3:45 You have made us filth and rubbish among the peoples.
25Lm 3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us;
25Lm 3:47 panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction.
25Lm 3:48 My eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of my people.
25Lm 3:49 My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,
25Lm 3:50 until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees.
25Lm 3:51 My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the young women in my city.
25Lm 3:52 Those who were my enemies without cause have hunted me like a bird;
25Lm 3:53 they flung me alive into a pit and hurled stones on me;
25Lm 3:54 water closed over my head; I said, "I am lost."
25Lm 3:55 I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit;
25Lm 3:56 you heard my plea, "Do not close your ear to my cry for help, but give me relief!"
25Lm 3:57 You came near when I called on you; you said, "Do not fear!"
25Lm 3:58 You have taken up my cause, O Lord, you have redeemed my life.
25Lm 3:59 You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause.
25Lm 3:60 You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:61 You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:62 The whispers and murmurs of my assailants are against me all day long.
25Lm 3:63 Whether they sit or rise--see, I am the object of their taunt-songs.
25Lm 3:64 Pay them back for their deeds, O LORD, according to the work of their hands!
25Lm 3:65 Give them anguish of heart; your curse be on them!
25Lm 3:66 Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the LORD's heavens.
25Lm 4:1 How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed! The sacred stones lie scattered at the head of every street.
25Lm 4:2 The precious children of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold--how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!
25Lm 4:3 Even the jackals offer the breast and nurse their young, but my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:4 The tongue of the infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives them anything.
25Lm 4:5 Those who feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple cling to ash heaps.
25Lm 4:6 For the chastisement of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, though no hand was laid on it.
25Lm 4:7 Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, their hair like sapphire.
25Lm 4:8 Now their visage is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.
25Lm 4:9 Happier were those pierced by the sword than those pierced by hunger, whose life drains away, deprived of the produce of the field.
25Lm 4:10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of my people.
25Lm 4:11 The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations.
25Lm 4:12 The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25Lm 4:13 It was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of her.
25Lm 4:14 Blindly they wandered through the streets, so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments.
25Lm 4:15 "Away! Unclean!" people shouted at them; "Away! Away! Do not touch!" So they became fugitives and wanderers; it was said among the nations, "They shall stay here no longer."
25Lm 4:16 The LORD himself has scattered them, he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders.
25Lm 4:17 Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; we were watching eagerly for a nation that could not save.
25Lm 4:18 They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered; for our end had come.
25Lm 4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:20 The LORD's anointed, the breath of our life, was taken in their pits--the one of whom we said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the nations."
25Lm 4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter Edom, you that live in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.
25Lm 4:22 The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter Zion, is accomplished, he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter Edom, he will punish, he will uncover your sins.
25Lm 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace!
25Lm 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to aliens.
25Lm 5:3 We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows.
25Lm 5:4 We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought.
25Lm 5:5 With a yoke on our necks we are hard driven; we are weary, we are given no rest.
25Lm 5:6 We have made a pact with Egypt and Assyria, to get enough bread.
25Lm 5:7 Our ancestors sinned; they are no more, and we bear their iniquities.
25Lm 5:8 Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hand.
25Lm 5:9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness.
25Lm 5:10 Our skin is black as an oven from the scorching heat of famine.
25Lm 5:11 Women are raped in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah.
25Lm 5:12 Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders.
25Lm 5:13 Young men are compelled to grind, and boys stagger under loads of wood.
25Lm 5:14 The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music.
25Lm 5:15 The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning.
25Lm 5:16 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!
25Lm 5:17 Because of this our hearts are sick, because of these things our eyes have grown dim:
25Lm 5:18 because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it.
25Lm 5:19 But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations.
25Lm 5:20 Why have you forgotten us completely? Why have you forsaken us these many days?
25Lm 5:21 Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored; renew our days as of old--
25Lm 5:22 unless you have utterly rejected us, and are angry with us beyond measure.
26
26Ezk 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
26Ezk 1:2 On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin),
26Ezk 1:3 the word of the LORD came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was on him there.
26Ezk 1:4 As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually, and in the middle of the fire, something like gleaming amber.
26Ezk 1:5 In the middle of it was something like four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of human form.
26Ezk 1:6 Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
26Ezk 1:7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.
26Ezk 1:8 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
26Ezk 1:9 their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without turning as they moved.
26Ezk 1:10 As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle;
26Ezk 1:11 such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.
26Ezk 1:12 Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.
26Ezk 1:13 In the middle of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire.
26Ezk 1:14 The living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.
26Ezk 1:15 As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
26Ezk 1:16 As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 1:17 When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved.
26Ezk 1:18 Their rims were tall and awesome, for the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
26Ezk 1:19 When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
26Ezk 1:20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:21 When they moved, the others moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:22 Over the heads of the living creatures there was something like a dome, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.
26Ezk 1:23 Under the dome their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body.
26Ezk 1:24 When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings.
26Ezk 1:25 And there came a voice from above the dome over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings.
26Ezk 1:26 And above the dome over their heads there was something like a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was something that seemed like a human form.
26Ezk 1:27 Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendor all around.
26Ezk 1:28 Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendor all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of someone speaking.
26Ezk 2:1 He said to me: O mortal, stand up on your feet, and I will speak with you.
26Ezk 2:2 And when he spoke to me, a spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and I heard him speaking to me.
26Ezk 2:3 He said to me, Mortal, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this very day.
26Ezk 2:4 The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD."
26Ezk 2:5 Whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house), they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
26Ezk 2:6 And you, O mortal, do not be afraid of them, and do not be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words, and do not be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 2:7 You shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 2:8 But you, mortal, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.
26Ezk 2:9 I looked, and a hand was stretched out to me, and a written scroll was in it.
26Ezk 2:10 He spread it before me; it had writing on the front and on the back, and written on it were words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
26Ezk 3:1 He said to me, O mortal, eat what is offered to you; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
26Ezk 3:3 He said to me, Mortal, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it. Then I ate it; and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey.
26Ezk 3:4 He said to me: Mortal, go to the house of Israel and speak my very words to them.
26Ezk 3:5 For you are not sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel--
26Ezk 3:6 not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.
26Ezk 3:7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me; because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
26Ezk 3:8 See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.
26Ezk 3:9 Like the hardest stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not fear them or be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 3:10 He said to me: Mortal, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart and hear with your ears;
26Ezk 3:11 then go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them. Say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD"; whether they hear or refuse to hear.
26Ezk 3:12 Then the spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the LORD rose from its place, I heard behind me the sound of loud rumbling;
26Ezk 3:13 it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a loud rumbling.
26Ezk 3:14 The spirit lifted me up and bore me away; I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me.
26Ezk 3:15 I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat there among them, stunned, for seven days.
26Ezk 3:16 At the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 3:17 Mortal, I have made you a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
26Ezk 3:18 If I say to the wicked, "You shall surely die," and you give them no warning, or speak to warn the wicked from their wicked way, in order to save their life, those wicked persons shall die for their iniquity; but their blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 3:19 But if you warn the wicked, and they do not turn from their wickedness, or from their wicked way, they shall die for their iniquity; but you will have saved your life.
26Ezk 3:20 Again, if the righteous turn from their righteousness and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before them, they shall die; because you have not warned them, they shall die for their sin, and their righteous deeds that they have done shall not be remembered; but their blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 3:21 If, however, you warn the righteous not to sin, and they do not sin, they shall surely live, because they took warning; and you will have saved your life.
26Ezk 3:22 Then the hand of the LORD was upon me there; and he said to me, Rise up, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you.
26Ezk 3:23 So I rose up and went out into the valley; and the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
26Ezk 3:24 The spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house.
26Ezk 3:25 As for you, mortal, cords shall be placed on you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people;
26Ezk 3:26 and I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be speechless and unable to reprove them; for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 3:27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD"; let those who will hear, hear; and let those who refuse to hear, refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 4:1 And you, O mortal, take a brick and set it before you. On it portray a city, Jerusalem;
26Ezk 4:2 and put siegeworks against it, and build a siege-wall against it, and cast up a ramp against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.
26Ezk 4:3 Then take an iron plate and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:4 Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel upon it; you shall bear their punishment for the number of the days that you lie there.
26Ezk 4:5 For I assign to you a number of days, three hundred ninety days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment; and so you shall bear the punishment of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:6 When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah; forty days I assign you, one day for each year.
26Ezk 4:7 You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and with your arm bared you shall prophesy against it.
26Ezk 4:8 See, I am putting cords on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.
26Ezk 4:9 And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread for yourself. During the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred ninety days, you shall eat it.
26Ezk 4:10 The food that you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; at fixed times you shall eat it.
26Ezk 4:11 And you shall drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; at fixed times you shall drink.
26Ezk 4:12 You shall eat it as a barley-cake, baking it in their sight on human dung.
26Ezk 4:13 The LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread, unclean, among the nations to which I will drive them."
26Ezk 4:14 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! I have never defiled myself; from my youth up until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by animals, nor has carrion flesh come into my mouth."
26Ezk 4:15 Then he said to me, "See, I will let you have cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread."
26Ezk 4:16 Then he said to me, Mortal, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay.
26Ezk 4:17 Lacking bread and water, they will look at one another in dismay, and waste away under their punishment.
26Ezk 5:1 And you, O mortal, take a sharp sword; use it as a barber's razor and run it over your head and your beard; then take balances for weighing, and divide the hair.
26Ezk 5:2 One third of the hair you shall burn in the fire inside the city, when the days of the siege are completed; one third you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city; and one third you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
26Ezk 5:3 Then you shall take from these a small number, and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
26Ezk 5:4 From these, again, you shall take some, throw them into the fire and burn them up; from there a fire will come out against all the house of Israel.
26Ezk 5:5 Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
26Ezk 5:6 But she has rebelled against my ordinances and my statutes, becoming more wicked than the nations and the countries all around her, rejecting my ordinances and not following my statutes.
26Ezk 5:7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not followed my statutes or kept my ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are all around you;
26Ezk 5:8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I, I myself, am coming against you; I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 5:9 And because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.
26Ezk 5:10 Surely, parents shall eat their children in your midst, and children shall eat their parents; I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to every wind.
26Ezk 5:11 Therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations--therefore I will cut you down; my eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
26Ezk 5:12 One third of you shall die of pestilence or be consumed by famine among you; one third shall fall by the sword around you; and one third I will scatter to every wind and will unsheathe the sword after them.
26Ezk 5:13 My anger shall spend itself, and I will vent my fury on them and satisfy myself; and they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my jealousy, when I spend my fury on them.
26Ezk 5:14 Moreover I will make you a desolation and an object of mocking among the nations around you, in the sight of all that pass by.
26Ezk 5:15 You shall be a mockery and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious punishments--I, the LORD, have spoken--
26Ezk 5:16 when I loose against you my deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will let loose to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you, and break your staff of bread.
26Ezk 5:17 I will send famine and wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children; pestilence and bloodshed shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 6:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 6:2 O mortal, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
26Ezk 6:3 and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I, I myself will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
26Ezk 6:4 Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense stands shall be broken; and I will throw down your slain in front of your idols.
26Ezk 6:5 I will lay the corpses of the people of Israel in front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
26Ezk 6:6 Wherever you live, your towns shall be waste and your high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense stands cut down, and your works wiped out.
26Ezk 6:7 The slain shall fall in your midst; then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 6:8 But I will spare some. Some of you shall escape the sword among the nations and be scattered through the countries.
26Ezk 6:9 Those of you who escape shall remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I was crushed by their wanton heart that turned away from me, and their wanton eyes that turned after their idols. Then they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations.
26Ezk 6:10 And they shall know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten in vain to bring this disaster upon them.
26Ezk 6:11 Thus says the Lord GOD: Clap your hands and stamp your foot, and say, Alas for all the vile abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
26Ezk 6:12 Those far off shall die of pestilence; those nearby shall fall by the sword; and any who are left and are spared shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
26Ezk 6:13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountain tops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing odor to all their idols.
26Ezk 6:14 I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate and waste, throughout all their settlements, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 7:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 7:2 You, O mortal, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
26Ezk 7:3 Now the end is upon you, I will let loose my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, I will punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:4 My eye will not spare you, I will have no pity. I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are among you. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 7:5 Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! See, it comes.
26Ezk 7:6 An end has come, the end has come. It has awakened against you; see, it comes!
26Ezk 7:7 Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near--of tumult, not of reveling on the mountains.
26Ezk 7:8 Soon now I will pour out my wrath upon you; I will spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your ways, and punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:9 My eye will not spare; I will have no pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are among you. Then you shall know that it is I the LORD who strike.
26Ezk 7:10 See, the day! See, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed, pride has budded.
26Ezk 7:11 Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, not their abundance, not their wealth; no pre-eminence among them.
26Ezk 7:12 The time has come, the day draws near; let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
26Ezk 7:13 For the sellers shall not return to what has been sold as long as they remain alive. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not be revoked. Because of their iniquity, they cannot maintain their lives.
26Ezk 7:14 They have blown the horn and made everything ready; but no one goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
26Ezk 7:15 The sword is outside, pestilence and famine are inside; those in the field die by the sword; those in the city--famine and pestilence devour them.
26Ezk 7:16 If any survivors escape, they shall be found on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning over their iniquity.
26Ezk 7:17 All hands shall grow feeble, all knees turn to water.
26Ezk 7:18 They shall put on sackcloth, horror shall cover them. Shame shall be on all faces, baldness on all their heads.
26Ezk 7:19 They shall fling their silver into the streets, their gold shall be treated as unclean. Their silver and gold cannot save them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. They shall not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
26Ezk 7:20 From their beautiful ornament, in which they took pride, they made their abominable images, their detestable things; therefore I will make of it an unclean thing to them.
26Ezk 7:21 I will hand it over to strangers as booty, to the wicked of the earth as plunder; they shall profane it.
26Ezk 7:22 I will avert my face from them, so that they may profane my treasured place; the violent shall enter it, they shall profane it.
26Ezk 7:23 Make a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes; the city is full of violence.
26Ezk 7:24 I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the arrogance of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.
26Ezk 7:25 When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
26Ezk 7:26 Disaster comes upon disaster, rumor follows rumor; they shall keep seeking a vision from the prophet; instruction shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
26Ezk 7:27 The king shall mourn, the prince shall be wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble. According to their way I will deal with them; according to their own judgments I will judge them. And they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 8:1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
26Ezk 8:2 I looked, and there was a figure that looked like a human being; below what appeared to be its loins it was fire, and above the loins it was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming amber.
26Ezk 8:3 It stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, to the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
26Ezk 8:4 And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I had seen in the valley.
26Ezk 8:5 Then God said to me, "O mortal, lift up your eyes now in the direction of the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.
26Ezk 8:6 He said to me, "Mortal, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? Yet you will see still greater abominations."
26Ezk 8:7 And he brought me to the entrance of the court; I looked, and there was a hole in the wall.
26Ezk 8:8 Then he said to me, "Mortal, dig through the wall"; and when I dug through the wall, there was an entrance.
26Ezk 8:9 He said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here."
26Ezk 8:10 So I went in and looked; there, portrayed on the wall all around, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 8:11 Before them stood seventy of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the fragrant cloud of incense was ascending.
26Ezk 8:12 Then he said to me, "Mortal, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of images? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'"
26Ezk 8:13 He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations that they are committing."
26Ezk 8:14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD; women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
26Ezk 8:15 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O mortal? You will see still greater abominations than these."
26Ezk 8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD; there, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, prostrating themselves to the sun toward the east.
26Ezk 8:17 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O mortal? Is it not bad enough that the house of Judah commits the abominations done here? Must they fill the land with violence, and provoke my anger still further? See, they are putting the branch to their nose!
26Ezk 8:18 Therefore I will act in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my hearing with a loud voice, I will not listen to them."
26Ezk 9:1 Then he cried in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, "Draw near, you executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."
26Ezk 9:2 And six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand; among them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
26Ezk 9:3 Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. The LORD called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his side;
26Ezk 9:4 and said to him, "Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of those who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it."
26Ezk 9:5 To the others he said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him, and kill; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
26Ezk 9:6 Cut down old men, young men and young women, little children and women, but touch no one who has the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were in front of the house.
26Ezk 9:7 Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out and killed in the city.
26Ezk 9:8 While they were killing, and I was left alone, I fell prostrate on my face and cried out, "Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all who remain of Israel as you pour out your wrath upon Jerusalem?"
26Ezk 9:9 He said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of perversity; for they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'
26Ezk 9:10 As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will bring down their deeds upon their heads."
26Ezk 9:11 Then the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
26Ezk 10:1 Then I looked, and above the dome that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in form resembling a throne.
26Ezk 10:2 He said to the man clothed in linen, "Go within the wheelwork underneath the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city." He went in as I looked on.
26Ezk 10:3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court.
26Ezk 10:4 Then the glory of the LORD rose up from the cherub to the threshold of the house; the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
26Ezk 10:5 The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
26Ezk 10:6 When he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.
26Ezk 10:7 And a cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
26Ezk 10:8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
26Ezk 10:9 I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like gleaming beryl.
26Ezk 10:10 And as for their appearance, the four looked alike, something like a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 10:11 When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved; but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without veering as they moved.
26Ezk 10:12 Their entire body, their rims, their spokes, their wings, and the wheels--the wheels of the four of them--were full of eyes all around.
26Ezk 10:13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing "the wheelwork."
26Ezk 10:14 Each one had four faces: the first face was that of the cherub, the second face was that of a human being, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle.
26Ezk 10:15 The cherubim rose up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.
26Ezk 10:16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels at their side did not veer.
26Ezk 10:17 When they stopped, the others stopped, and when they rose up, the others rose up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
26Ezk 10:18 Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house and stopped above the cherubim.
26Ezk 10:19 The cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight as they went out with the wheels beside them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD; and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26Ezk 10:20 These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
26Ezk 10:21 Each had four faces, each four wings, and underneath their wings something like human hands.
26Ezk 10:22 As for what their faces were like, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one moved straight ahead.
26Ezk 11:1 The spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. There, at the entrance of the gateway, were twenty-five men; among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, officials of the people.
26Ezk 11:2 He said to me, "Mortal, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
26Ezk 11:3 they say, 'The time is not near to build houses; this city is the pot, and we are the meat.'
26Ezk 11:4 Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O mortal."
26Ezk 11:5 Then the spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, "Say, Thus says the LORD: This is what you think, O house of Israel; I know the things that come into your mind.
26Ezk 11:6 You have killed many in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain.
26Ezk 11:7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: The slain whom you have placed within it are the meat, and this city is the pot; but you shall be taken out of it.
26Ezk 11:8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 11:9 I will take you out of it and give you over to the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.
26Ezk 11:10 You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 11:11 This city shall not be your pot, and you shall not be the meat inside it; I will judge you at the border of Israel.
26Ezk 11:12 Then you shall know that I am the LORD, whose statutes you have not followed, and whose ordinances you have not kept, but you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are around you."
26Ezk 11:13 Now, while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, cried with a loud voice, and said, "Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
26Ezk 11:14 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 11:15 Mortal, your kinsfolk, your own kin, your fellow exiles, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, "They have gone far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession."
26Ezk 11:16 Therefore say: Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far away among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have gone.
26Ezk 11:17 Therefore say: Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
26Ezk 11:18 When they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
26Ezk 11:19 I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
26Ezk 11:20 so that they may follow my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
26Ezk 11:21 But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 11:22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26Ezk 11:23 And the glory of the LORD ascended from the middle of the city, and stopped on the mountain east of the city.
26Ezk 11:24 The spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen left me.
26Ezk 11:25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
26Ezk 12:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:2 Mortal, you are living in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, who have ears to hear but do not hear;
26Ezk 12:3 for they are a rebellious house. Therefore, mortal, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight; you shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile; and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who go into exile.
26Ezk 12:5 Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry the baggage through it.
26Ezk 12:6 In their sight you shall lift the baggage on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark; you shall cover your face, so that you may not see the land; for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 12:7 I did just as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands; I brought it out in the dark, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
26Ezk 12:8 In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:9 Mortal, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, "What are you doing?"
26Ezk 12:10 Say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel in it."
26Ezk 12:11 Say, "I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity."
26Ezk 12:12 And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage on his shoulder in the dark, and shall go out; he shall dig through the wall and carry it through; he shall cover his face, so that he may not see the land with his eyes.
26Ezk 12:13 I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it; and he shall die there.
26Ezk 12:14 I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will unsheathe the sword behind them.
26Ezk 12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
26Ezk 12:16 But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations where they go; then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 12:17 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:18 Mortal, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness;
26Ezk 12:19 and say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, because their land shall be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who live in it.
26Ezk 12:20 The inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 12:21 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:22 Mortal, what is this proverb of yours about the land of Israel, which says, "The days are prolonged, and every vision comes to nothing"?
26Ezk 12:23 Tell them therefore, "Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall use it no more as a proverb in Israel." But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision.
26Ezk 12:24 For there shall no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
26Ezk 12:25 But I the LORD will speak the word that I speak, and it will be fulfilled. It will no longer be delayed; but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and fulfill it, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 12:26 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:27 Mortal, the house of Israel is saying, "The vision that he sees is for many years ahead; he prophesies for distant times."
26Ezk 12:28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be fulfilled, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 13:2 Mortal, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying; say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: "Hear the word of the LORD!"
26Ezk 13:3 Thus says the Lord GOD, Alas for the senseless prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
26Ezk 13:4 Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel.
26Ezk 13:5 You have not gone up into the breaches, or repaired a wall for the house of Israel, so that it might stand in battle on the day of the LORD.
26Ezk 13:6 They have envisioned falsehood and lying divination; they say, "Says the LORD," when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they wait for the fulfillment of their word!
26Ezk 13:7 Have you not seen a false vision or uttered a lying divination, when you have said, "Says the LORD," even though I did not speak?
26Ezk 13:8 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have uttered falsehood and envisioned lies, I am against you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:9 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations; they shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:10 Because, in truth, because they have misled my people, saying, "Peace," when there is no peace; and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear whitewash on it.
26Ezk 13:11 Say to those who smear whitewash on it that it shall fall. There will be a deluge of rain, great hailstones will fall, and a stormy wind will break out.
26Ezk 13:12 When the wall falls, will it not be said to you, "Where is the whitewash you smeared on it?"
26Ezk 13:13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: In my wrath I will make a stormy wind break out, and in my anger there shall be a deluge of rain, and hailstones in wrath to destroy it.
26Ezk 13:14 I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you shall perish within it; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:15 Thus I will spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it--
26Ezk 13:16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for it, when there was no peace, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 13:17 As for you, mortal, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own imagination; prophesy against them
26Ezk 13:18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew bands on all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every height, in the hunt for human lives! Will you hunt down lives among my people, and maintain your own lives?
26Ezk 13:19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death persons who should not die and keeping alive persons who should not live, by your lies to my people, who listen to lies.
26Ezk 13:20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I am against your bands with which you hunt lives; I will tear them from your arms, and let the lives go free, the lives that you hunt down like birds.
26Ezk 13:21 I will tear off your veils, and save my people from your hands; they shall no longer be prey in your hands; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:22 Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not disheartened them, and you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their wicked way and save their lives;
26Ezk 13:23 therefore you shall no longer see false visions or practice divination; I will save my people from your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 14:1 Certain elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me.
26Ezk 14:2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:3 Mortal, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and placed their iniquity as a stumbling block before them; shall I let myself be consulted by them?
26Ezk 14:4 Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any of those of the house of Israel who take their idols into their hearts and place their iniquity as a stumbling block before them, and yet come to the prophet--I the LORD will answer those who come with the multitude of their idols,
26Ezk 14:5 in order that I may take hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, all of whom are estranged from me through their idols.
26Ezk 14:6 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
26Ezk 14:7 For any of those of the house of Israel, or of the aliens who reside in Israel, who separate themselves from me, taking their idols into their hearts and placing their iniquity as a stumbling block before them, and yet come to a prophet to inquire of me by him, I the LORD will answer them myself.
26Ezk 14:8 I will set my face against them; I will make them a sign and a byword and cut them off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 14:9 If a prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
26Ezk 14:10 And they shall bear their punishment--the punishment of the inquirer and the punishment of the prophet shall be the same--
26Ezk 14:11 so that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions. Then they shall be my people and I will be their God, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 14:12 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:13 Mortal, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it human beings and animals,
26Ezk 14:14 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job, these three, were in it, they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 14:15 If I send wild animals through the land to ravage it, so that it is made desolate, and no one may pass through because of the animals;
26Ezk 14:16 even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would save neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.
26Ezk 14:17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, 'Let a sword pass through the land,' and I cut off human beings and animals from it;
26Ezk 14:18 though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would save neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be saved.
26Ezk 14:19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off humans and animals from it;
26Ezk 14:20 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would save neither son nor daughter; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness.
26Ezk 14:21 For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four deadly acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild animals, and pestilence, to cut off humans and animals from it!
26Ezk 14:22 Yet, survivors shall be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; they will come out to you. When you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
26Ezk 14:23 They shall console you, when you see their ways and their deeds; and you shall know that it was not without cause that I did all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 15:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 15:2 O mortal, how does the wood of the vine surpass all other wood--the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
26Ezk 15:3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Does one take a peg from it on which to hang any object?
26Ezk 15:4 It is put in the fire for fuel; when the fire has consumed both ends of it and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
26Ezk 15:5 When it was whole it was used for nothing; how much less--when the fire has consumed it, and it is charred--can it ever be used for anything!
26Ezk 15:6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
26Ezk 15:7 I will set my face against them; although they escape from the fire, the fire shall still consume them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
26Ezk 15:8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 16:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 16:2 Mortal, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
26Ezk 16:3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.
26Ezk 16:4 As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in cloths.
26Ezk 16:5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you out of compassion for you; but you were thrown out in the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.
26Ezk 16:6 I passed by you, and saw you flailing about in your blood. As you lay in your blood, I said to you, "Live!
26Ezk 16:7 and grow up like a plant of the field." You grew up and became tall and arrived at full womanhood; your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.
26Ezk 16:8 I passed by you again and looked on you; you were at the age for love. I spread the edge of my cloak over you, and covered your nakedness: I pledged myself to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord GOD, and you became mine.
26Ezk 16:9 Then I bathed you with water and washed off the blood from you, and anointed you with oil.
26Ezk 16:10 I clothed you with embroidered cloth and with sandals of fine leather; I bound you in fine linen and covered you with rich fabric.
26Ezk 16:11 I adorned you with ornaments: I put bracelets on your arms, a chain on your neck,
26Ezk 16:12 a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.
26Ezk 16:13 You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, rich fabric, and embroidered cloth. You had choice flour and honey and oil for food. You grew exceedingly beautiful, fit to be a queen.
26Ezk 16:14 Your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of my splendor that I had bestowed on you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 16:15 But you trusted in your beauty, and played the whore because of your fame, and lavished your whorings on any passer-by.
26Ezk 16:16 You took some of your garments, and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore; nothing like this has ever been or ever shall be.
26Ezk 16:17 You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and my silver that I had given you, and made for yourself male images, and with them played the whore;
26Ezk 16:18 and you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
26Ezk 16:19 Also my bread that I gave you--I fed you with choice flour and oil and honey--you set it before them as a pleasing odor; and so it was, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 16:20 You took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. As if your whorings were not enough!
26Ezk 16:21 You slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering to them.
26Ezk 16:22 And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, flailing about in your blood.
26Ezk 16:23 After all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! says the Lord GOD),
26Ezk 16:24 you built yourself a platform and made yourself a lofty place in every square;
26Ezk 16:25 at the head of every street you built your lofty place and prostituted your beauty, offering yourself to every passer-by, and multiplying your whoring.
26Ezk 16:26 You played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger.
26Ezk 16:27 Therefore I stretched out my hand against you, reduced your rations, and gave you up to the will of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
26Ezk 16:28 You played the whore with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied.
26Ezk 16:29 You multiplied your whoring with Chaldea, the land of merchants; and even with this you were not satisfied.
26Ezk 16:30 How sick is your heart, says the Lord GOD, that you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen whore;
26Ezk 16:31 building your platform at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square! Yet you were not like a whore, because you scorned payment.
26Ezk 16:32 Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
26Ezk 16:33 Gifts are given to all whores; but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from all around for your whorings.
26Ezk 16:34 So you were different from other women in your whorings: no one solicited you to play the whore; and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; you were different.
26Ezk 16:35 Therefore, O whore, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 16:36 Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whoring with your lovers, and because of all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
26Ezk 16:37 therefore, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated; I will gather them against you from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, so that they may see all your nakedness.
26Ezk 16:38 I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring blood upon you in wrath and jealousy.
26Ezk 16:39 I will deliver you into their hands, and they shall throw down your platform and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful objects and leave you naked and bare.
26Ezk 16:40 They shall bring up a mob against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
26Ezk 16:41 They shall burn your houses and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; I will stop you from playing the whore, and you shall also make no more payments.
26Ezk 16:42 So I will satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall turn away from you; I will be calm, and will be angry no longer.
26Ezk 16:43 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things; therefore, I have returned your deeds upon your head, says the Lord GOD. Have you not committed lewdness beyond all your abominations?
26Ezk 16:44 See, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, "Like mother, like daughter."
26Ezk 16:45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26Ezk 16:46 Your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
26Ezk 16:47 You not only followed their ways, and acted according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
26Ezk 16:48 As I live, says the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
26Ezk 16:49 This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.
26Ezk 16:50 They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.
26Ezk 16:51 Samaria has not committed half your sins; you have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed.
26Ezk 16:52 Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have brought about for your sisters a more favorable judgment; because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
26Ezk 16:53 I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes along with theirs,
26Ezk 16:54 in order that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.
26Ezk 16:55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
26Ezk 16:56 Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,
26Ezk 16:57 before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you are a mockery to the daughters of Aram and all her neighbors, and to the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.
26Ezk 16:58 You must bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, says the LORD.
26Ezk 16:59 Yes, thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath, breaking the covenant;
26Ezk 16:60 yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant.
26Ezk 16:61 Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed when I take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and give them to you as daughters, but not on account of my covenant with you.
26Ezk 16:62 I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
26Ezk 16:63 in order that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you all that you have done, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 17:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:2 O mortal, propound a riddle, and speak an allegory to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 17:3 Say: Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle, with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to the Lebanon. He took the top of the cedar,
26Ezk 17:4 broke off its topmost shoot; He carried it to a land of trade, set it in a city of merchants.
26Ezk 17:5 Then he took a seed from the land, placed it in fertile soil; A plant by abundant waters, he set it like a willow twig.
26Ezk 17:6 It sprouted and became a vine spreading out, but low; Its branches turned toward him, its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine; it brought forth branches, put forth foliage.
26Ezk 17:7 There was another great eagle, with great wings and much plumage. And see! This vine stretched out its roots toward him; It shot out its branches toward him, so that he might water it. From the bed where it was planted
26Ezk 17:8 it was transplanted to good soil by abundant waters, so that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
26Ezk 17:9 Say: Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it prosper? Will he not pull up its roots, cause its fruit to rot and wither, its fresh sprouting leaves to fade? No strong arm or mighty army will be needed to pull it from its roots.
26Ezk 17:10 When it is transplanted, will it thrive? When the east wind strikes it, will it not utterly wither, wither on the bed where it grew?
26Ezk 17:11 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:12 Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and its officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon.
26Ezk 17:13 He took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath (he had taken away the chief men of the land),
26Ezk 17:14 so that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
26Ezk 17:15 But he rebelled against him by sending ambassadors to Egypt, in order that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?
26Ezk 17:16 As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king resides who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke--in Babylon he shall die.
26Ezk 17:17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when ramps are cast up and siege-walls built to cut off many lives.
26Ezk 17:18 Because he despised the oath and broke the covenant, because he gave his hand and yet did all these things, he shall not escape.
26Ezk 17:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, I will surely return upon his head my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke.
26Ezk 17:20 I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treason he has committed against me.
26Ezk 17:21 All the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 17:22 Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of a cedar; I will set it out. I will break off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs; I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
26Ezk 17:23 On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it, in order that it may produce boughs and bear fruit, and become a noble cedar. Under it every kind of bird will live; in the shade of its branches will nest winged creatures of every kind.
26Ezk 17:24 All the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD. I bring low the high tree, I make high the low tree; I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I the LORD have spoken; I will accomplish it.
26Ezk 18:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 18:2 What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, "The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge"?
26Ezk 18:3 As I live, says the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
26Ezk 18:4 Know that all lives are mine; the life of the parent as well as the life of the child is mine: it is only the person who sins that shall die.
26Ezk 18:5 If a man is righteous and does what is lawful and right--
26Ezk 18:6 if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period,
26Ezk 18:7 does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
26Ezk 18:8 does not take advance or accrued interest, withholds his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between contending parties,
26Ezk 18:9 follows my statutes, and is careful to observe my ordinances, acting faithfully--such a one is righteous; he shall surely live, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 18:10 If he has a son who is violent, a shedder of blood,
26Ezk 18:11 who does any of these things (though his father does none of them), who eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,
26Ezk 18:13 takes advance or accrued interest; shall he then live? He shall not. He has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.
26Ezk 18:14 But if this man has a son who sees all the sins that his father has done, considers, and does not do likewise,
26Ezk 18:15 who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:16 does not wrong anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
26Ezk 18:17 withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no advance or accrued interest, observes my ordinances, and follows my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.
26Ezk 18:18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, he dies for his iniquity.
26Ezk 18:19 Yet you say, "Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?" When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.
26Ezk 18:20 The person who sins shall die. A child shall not suffer for the iniquity of a parent, nor a parent suffer for the iniquity of a child; the righteousness of the righteous shall be his own, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be his own.
26Ezk 18:21 But if the wicked turn away from all their sins that they have committed and keep all my statutes and do what is lawful and right, they shall surely live; they shall not die.
26Ezk 18:22 None of the transgressions that they have committed shall be remembered against them; for the righteousness that they have done they shall live.
26Ezk 18:23 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord GOD, and not rather that they should turn from their ways and live?
26Ezk 18:24 But when the righteous turn away from their righteousness and commit iniquity and do the same abominable things that the wicked do, shall they live? None of the righteous deeds that they have done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which they are guilty and the sin they have committed, they shall die.
26Ezk 18:25 Yet you say, "The way of the Lord is unfair." Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26Ezk 18:26 When the righteous turn away from their righteousness and commit iniquity, they shall die for it; for the iniquity that they have committed they shall die.
26Ezk 18:27 Again, when the wicked turn away from the wickedness they have committed and do what is lawful and right, they shall save their life.
26Ezk 18:28 Because they considered and turned away from all the transgressions that they had committed, they shall surely live; they shall not die.
26Ezk 18:29 Yet the house of Israel says, "The way of the Lord is unfair." O house of Israel, are my ways unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26Ezk 18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, all of you according to your ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions; otherwise iniquity will be your ruin.
26Ezk 18:31 Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?
26Ezk 18:32 For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, says the Lord GOD. Turn, then, and live.
26Ezk 19:1 As for you, raise up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
26Ezk 19:2 and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She lay down among young lions, rearing her cubs.
26Ezk 19:3 She raised up one of her cubs; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured humans.
26Ezk 19:4 The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was caught in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 19:5 When she saw that she was thwarted, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
26Ezk 19:6 He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured people.
26Ezk 19:7 And he ravaged their strongholds, and laid waste their towns; the land was appalled, and all in it, at the sound of his roaring.
26Ezk 19:8 The nations set upon him from the provinces all around; they spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
26Ezk 19:9 With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, so that his voice should be heard no more on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 19:10 Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches from abundant water.
26Ezk 19:11 Its strongest stem became a ruler's scepter; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it stood out in its height with its mass of branches.
26Ezk 19:12 But it was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was withered; the fire consumed it.
26Ezk 19:13 Now it is transplanted into the wilderness, into a dry and thirsty land.
26Ezk 19:14 And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation, and it is used as a lamentation.
26Ezk 20:1 In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain elders of Israel came to consult the LORD, and sat down before me.
26Ezk 20:2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:3 Mortal, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: Why are you coming? To consult me? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you.
26Ezk 20:4 Will you judge them, mortal, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their ancestors,
26Ezk 20:5 and say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob--making myself known to them in the land of Egypt--I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:6 On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.
26Ezk 20:7 And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:8 But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; not one of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:9 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:10 So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:11 I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live.
26Ezk 20:12 Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, so that they might know that I the LORD sanctify them.
26Ezk 20:13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not observe my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make an end of them.
26Ezk 20:14 But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:15 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,
26Ezk 20:16 because they rejected my ordinances and did not observe my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
26Ezk 20:17 Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make an end of them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:18 I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not follow the statutes of your parents, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
26Ezk 20:19 I the LORD am your God; follow my statutes, and be careful to observe my ordinances,
26Ezk 20:20 and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, so that you may know that I the LORD am your God.
26Ezk 20:21 But the children rebelled against me; they did not follow my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:22 But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:23 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
26Ezk 20:24 because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their ancestors' idols.
26Ezk 20:25 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live.
26Ezk 20:26 I defiled them through their very gifts, in their offering up all their firstborn, in order that I might horrify them, so that they might know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:27 Therefore, mortal, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this again your ancestors blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.
26Ezk 20:28 For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
26Ezk 20:29 (I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So it is called Bamah to this day.)
26Ezk 20:30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your ancestors and go astray after their detestable things?
26Ezk 20:31 When you offer your gifts and make your children pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be consulted by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you.
26Ezk 20:32 What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, "Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone."
26Ezk 20:33 As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.
26Ezk 20:34 I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;
26Ezk 20:35 and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
26Ezk 20:36 As I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 20:37 I will make you pass under the staff, and will bring you within the bond of the covenant.
26Ezk 20:38 I will purge out the rebels among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they reside as aliens, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve your idols, everyone of you now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.
26Ezk 20:40 For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred things.
26Ezk 20:41 As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 20:42 You shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your ancestors.
26Ezk 20:43 There you shall remember your ways and all the deeds by which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.
26Ezk 20:44 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, or corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 20:45 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:46 Mortal, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb;
26Ezk 20:47 say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
26Ezk 20:48 All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
26Ezk 20:49 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! they are saying of me, 'Is he not a maker of allegories?'"
26Ezk 21:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:2 Mortal, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries; prophesy against the land of Israel
26Ezk 21:3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: I am coming against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
26Ezk 21:4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north;
26Ezk 21:5 and all flesh shall know that I the LORD have drawn my sword out of its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.
26Ezk 21:6 Moan therefore, mortal; moan with breaking heart and bitter grief before their eyes.
26Ezk 21:7 And when they say to you, "Why do you moan?" you shall say, "Because of the news that has come. Every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will turn to water. See, it comes and it will be fulfilled," says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 21:8 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:9 Mortal, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord; Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened, it is also polished;
26Ezk 21:10 It is sharpened for slaughter, honed to flash like lightning! How can we make merry? You have despised the rod, and all discipline.
26Ezk 21:11 The sword is given to be polished, to be grasped in the hand; It is sharpened, the sword is polished, to be placed in the slayer's hand.
26Ezk 21:12 Cry and wail, O mortal, for it is against my people; it is against all Israel's princes; they are thrown to the sword, together with my people. Ah! Strike the thigh!
26Ezk 21:13 For consider: What! If you despise the rod, will it not happen? says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 21:14 And you, mortal, prophesy; Strike hand to hand. Let the sword fall twice, thrice; it is a sword for killing. A sword for great slaughter--it surrounds them;
26Ezk 21:15 therefore hearts melt and many stumble. At all their gates I have set the point of the sword. Ah! It is made for flashing, it is polished for slaughter.
26Ezk 21:16 Attack to the right! Engage to the left! Wherever your edge is directed.
26Ezk 21:17 I too will strike hand to hand, I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken.
26Ezk 21:18 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:19 Mortal, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall issue from the same land. And make a signpost, make it for a fork in the road leading to a city;
26Ezk 21:20 mark out the road for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites or to Judah and to Jerusalem the fortified.
26Ezk 21:21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the fork in the two roads, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he inspects the liver.
26Ezk 21:22 Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to call out for slaughter, for raising the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build siege-towers.
26Ezk 21:23 But to them it will seem like a false divination; they have sworn solemn oaths; but he brings their guilt to remembrance, bringing about their capture.
26Ezk 21:24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have brought your guilt to remembrance, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
26Ezk 21:25 As for you, vile, wicked prince of Israel, you whose day has come, the time of final punishment,
26Ezk 21:26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban, take off the crown; things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, abase that which is high.
26Ezk 21:27 A ruin, a ruin, a ruin--I will make it! (Such has never occurred.) Until he comes whose right it is; to him I will give it.
26Ezk 21:28 As for you, mortal, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; say: A sword, a sword! Drawn for slaughter Polished to consume, to flash like lightning.
26Ezk 21:29 Offering false visions for you, divining lies for you, they place you over the necks of the vile, wicked ones--those whose day has come, the time of final punishment.
26Ezk 21:30 Return it to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
26Ezk 21:31 I will pour out my indignation upon you, with the fire of my wrath I will blow upon you. I will deliver you into brutish hands, those skillful to destroy.
26Ezk 21:32 You shall be fuel for the fire, your blood shall enter the earth; You shall be remembered no more, for I the LORD have spoken.
26Ezk 22:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:2 You, mortal, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to it all its abominable deeds.
26Ezk 22:3 You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city! Shedding blood within itself; its time has come; making its idols, defiling itself.
26Ezk 22:4 You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made; you have brought your day near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a disgrace before the nations, and a mockery to all the countries.
26Ezk 22:5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.
26Ezk 22:6 The princes of Israel in you, everyone according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
26Ezk 22:7 Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the alien residing within you suffers extortion; the orphan and the widow are wronged in you.
26Ezk 22:8 You have despised my holy things, and profaned my sabbaths.
26Ezk 22:9 In you are those who slander to shed blood, those in you who eat upon the mountains, who commit lewdness in your midst.
26Ezk 22:10 In you they uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women in their menstrual periods.
26Ezk 22:11 One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you defiles his sister, his father's daughter.
26Ezk 22:12 In you, they take bribes to shed blood; you take both advance interest and accrued interest, and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; and you have forgotten me, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 22:13 See, I strike my hands together at the dishonest gain you have made, and at the blood that has been shed within you.
26Ezk 22:14 Can your courage endure, or can your hands remain strong in the days when I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
26Ezk 22:15 I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and I will purge your filthiness out of you.
26Ezk 22:16 And I shall be profaned through you in the sight of the nations; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 22:17 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:18 Mortal, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them, silver, bronze, tin, iron, and lead. In the smelter they have become dross.
26Ezk 22:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
26Ezk 22:20 As one gathers silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into a smelter, to blow the fire upon them in order to melt them; so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you.
26Ezk 22:21 I will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted within it.
26Ezk 22:22 As silver is melted in a smelter, so you shall be melted in it; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.
26Ezk 22:23 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:24 Mortal, say to it: You are a land that is not cleansed, not rained upon in the day of indignation.
26Ezk 22:25 Its princes within it are like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows within it.
26Ezk 22:26 Its priests have done violence to my teaching and have profaned my holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
26Ezk 22:27 Its officials within it are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
26Ezk 22:28 Its prophets have smeared whitewash on their behalf, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, "Thus says the Lord GOD," when the LORD has not spoken.
26Ezk 22:29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the alien without redress.
26Ezk 22:30 And I sought for anyone among them who would repair the wall and stand in the breach before me on behalf of the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.
26Ezk 22:31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; I have returned their conduct upon their heads, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 23:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 23:2 Mortal, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
26Ezk 23:3 they played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; their breasts were caressed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled.
26Ezk 23:4 Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
26Ezk 23:5 Oholah played the whore while she was mine; she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors
26Ezk 23:6 clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, mounted horsemen.
26Ezk 23:7 She bestowed her favors upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone for whom she lusted.
26Ezk 23:8 She did not give up her whorings that she had practiced since Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.
26Ezk 23:9 Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.
26Ezk 23:10 These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. Judgment was executed upon her, and she became a byword among women.
26Ezk 23:11 Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she in her lusting and in her whorings, which were worse than those of her sister.
26Ezk 23:12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, mounted horsemen, all of them handsome young men.
26Ezk 23:13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
26Ezk 23:14 But she carried her whorings further; she saw male figures carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
26Ezk 23:15 with belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers--a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:16 When she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust; and after she defiled herself with them, she turned from them in disgust.
26Ezk 23:18 When she carried on her whorings so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her sister.
26Ezk 23:19 Yet she increased her whorings, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
26Ezk 23:20 and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose emission was like that of stallions.
26Ezk 23:21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your bosom and caressed your young breasts.
26Ezk 23:22 Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: I will rouse against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
26Ezk 23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and warriors, all of them riding on horses.
26Ezk 23:24 They shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples; they shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet, and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their ordinances.
26Ezk 23:25 I will direct my indignation against you, in order that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
26Ezk 23:26 They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels.
26Ezk 23:27 So I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring brought from the land of Egypt; you shall not long for them, or remember Egypt any more.
26Ezk 23:28 For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust;
26Ezk 23:29 and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit of your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whorings shall be exposed. Your lewdness and your whorings
26Ezk 23:30 have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations, and polluted yourself with their idols.
26Ezk 23:31 You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
26Ezk 23:32 Thus says the Lord GOD: You shall drink your sister's cup, deep and wide; you shall be scorned and derided, it holds so much.
26Ezk 23:33 You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation is the cup of your sister Samaria;
26Ezk 23:34 you shall drink it and drain it out, and gnaw its sherds, and tear out your breasts; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 23:35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore bear the consequences of your lewdness and whorings.
26Ezk 23:36 The LORD said to me: Mortal, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds.
26Ezk 23:37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
26Ezk 23:38 Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my sabbaths.
26Ezk 23:39 For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. This is what they did in my house.
26Ezk 23:40 They even sent for men to come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments;
26Ezk 23:41 you sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.
26Ezk 23:42 The sound of a raucous multitude was around her, with many of the rabble brought in drunken from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the arms of the women, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
26Ezk 23:43 Then I said, Ah, she is worn out with adulteries, but they carry on their sexual acts with her.
26Ezk 23:44 For they have gone in to her, as one goes in to a whore. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, wanton women.
26Ezk 23:45 But righteous judges shall declare them guilty of adultery and of bloodshed; because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
26Ezk 23:46 For thus says the Lord GOD: Bring up an assembly against them, and make them an object of terror and of plunder.
26Ezk 23:47 The assembly shall stone them and with their swords they shall cut them down; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses.
26Ezk 23:48 Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, so that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
26Ezk 23:49 They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 24:1 In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:2 Mortal, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
26Ezk 24:3 And utter an allegory to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Set on the pot, set it on, pour in water also;
26Ezk 24:4 put in it the pieces, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones.
26Ezk 24:5 Take the choicest one of the flock, pile the logs under it; boil its pieces, seethe also its bones in it.
26Ezk 24:6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, the pot whose rust is in it, whose rust has not gone out of it! Empty it piece by piece, making no choice at all.
26Ezk 24:7 For the blood she shed is inside it; she placed it on a bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground, to cover it with earth.
26Ezk 24:8 To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have placed the blood she shed on a bare rock, so that it may not be covered.
26Ezk 24:9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile great.
26Ezk 24:10 Heap up the logs, kindle the fire; boil the meat well, mix in the spices, let the bones be burned.
26Ezk 24:11 Stand it empty upon the coals, so that it may become hot, its copper glow, its filth melt in it, its rust be consumed.
26Ezk 24:12 In vain I have wearied myself; its thick rust does not depart. To the fire with its rust!
26Ezk 24:13 Yet, when I cleansed you in your filthy lewdness, you did not become clean from your filth; you shall not again be cleansed until I have satisfied my fury upon you.
26Ezk 24:14 I the LORD have spoken; the time is coming, I will act. I will not refrain, I will not spare, I will not relent. According to your ways and your doings I will judge you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 24:15 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:16 Mortal, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
26Ezk 24:17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.
26Ezk 24:18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
26Ezk 24:19 Then the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting this way?"
26Ezk 24:20 Then I said to them: The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:21 Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and your heart's desire; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
26Ezk 24:22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.
26Ezk 24:23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
26Ezk 24:24 Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; you shall do just as he has done. When this comes, then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 24:25 And you, mortal, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their heart's affection, and also their sons and their daughters,
26Ezk 24:26 on that day, one who has escaped will come to you to report to you the news.
26Ezk 24:27 On that day your mouth shall be opened to the one who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be silent. So you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 25:2 Mortal, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 25:3 Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, "Aha!" over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when it went into exile;
26Ezk 25:4 therefore I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession. They shall set their encampments among you and pitch their tents in your midst; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
26Ezk 25:5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a fold for flocks. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within you against the land of Israel,
26Ezk 25:7 therefore I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:8 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab said, The house of Judah is like all the other nations,
26Ezk 25:9 therefore I will lay open the flank of Moab from the towns on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
26Ezk 25:10 I will give it along with Ammon to the people of the East as a possession. Thus Ammon shall be remembered no more among the nations,
26Ezk 25:11 and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 25:12 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance upon them,
26Ezk 25:13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it humans and animals, and I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
26Ezk 25:14 I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall act in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 25:15 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because with unending hostilities the Philistines acted in vengeance, and with malice of heart took revenge in destruction;
26Ezk 25:16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
26Ezk 25:17 I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful punishments. Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance on them.
26Ezk 26:1 In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 26:2 Mortal, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, "Aha, broken is the gateway of the peoples; it has swung open to me; I shall be replenished, now that it is wasted."
26Ezk 26:3 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: See, I am against you, O Tyre! I will hurl many nations against you, as the sea hurls its waves.
26Ezk 26:4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down its towers. I will scrape its soil from it and make it a bare rock.
26Ezk 26:5 It shall become, in the midst of the sea, a place for spreading nets. I have spoken, says the Lord GOD. It shall become plunder for the nations,
26Ezk 26:6 and its daughter-towns in the country shall be killed by the sword. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 26:7 For thus says the Lord GOD: I will bring against Tyre from the north King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, king of kings, together with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great and powerful army.
26Ezk 26:8 Your daughter-towns in the country he shall put to the sword. He shall set up a siege-wall against you, cast up a ramp against you, and raise a roof of shields against you.
26Ezk 26:9 He shall direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls and break down your towers with his axes.
26Ezk 26:10 His horses shall be so many that their dust shall cover you. At the noise of cavalry, wheels, and chariots your very walls shall shake, when he enters your gates like those entering a breached city.
26Ezk 26:11 With the hoofs of his horses he shall trample all your streets. He shall put your people to the sword, and your strong pillars shall fall to the ground.
26Ezk 26:12 They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise: they shall break down your walls and destroy your fine houses. Your stones and timber and soil they shall cast into the water.
26Ezk 26:13 I will silence the music of your songs; the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more.
26Ezk 26:14 I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for spreading nets. You shall never again be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 26:15 Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter goes on within you?
26Ezk 26:16 Then all the princes of the sea shall step down from their thrones; they shall remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling, and shall sit on the ground; they shall tremble every moment, and be appalled at you.
26Ezk 26:17 And they shall raise a lamentation over you, and say to you: How you have vanished from the seas, O city renowned, once mighty on the sea, you and your inhabitants, who imposed your terror on all the mainland!
26Ezk 26:18 Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; the coastlands by the sea are dismayed at your passing.
26Ezk 26:19 For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,
26Ezk 26:20 then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of long ago, and I will make you live in the world below, among primeval ruins, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or have a place in the land of the living.
26Ezk 26:21 I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more; though sought for, you will never be found again, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 27:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 27:2 Now you, mortal, raise a lamentation over Tyre,
26Ezk 27:3 and say to Tyre, which sits at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coastlands, Thus says the Lord GOD: O Tyre, you have said, "I am perfect in beauty."
26Ezk 27:4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders made perfect your beauty.
26Ezk 27:5 They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26Ezk 27:6 From oaks of Bashan they made your oars; they made your deck of pines from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory.
26Ezk 27:7 Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail, serving as your ensign; blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was your awning.
26Ezk 27:8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; skilled men of Zemer were within you, they were your pilots.
26Ezk 27:9 The elders of Gebal and its artisans were within you, caulking your seams; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were within you, to barter for your wares.
26Ezk 27:10 Paras and Lud and Put were in your army, your mighty warriors; they hung shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor.
26Ezk 27:11 Men of Arvad and Helech were on your walls all around; men of Gamad were at your towers. They hung their quivers all around your walls; they made perfect your beauty.
26Ezk 27:12 Tarshish did business with you out of the abundance of your great wealth; silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your wares.
26Ezk 27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they exchanged human beings and vessels of bronze for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:14 Beth-togarmah exchanged for your wares horses, war horses, and mules.
26Ezk 27:15 The Rhodians traded with you; many coastlands were your own special markets; they brought you in payment ivory tusks and ebony.
26Ezk 27:16 Edom did business with you because of your abundant goods; they exchanged for your wares turquoise, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies.
26Ezk 27:17 Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged for your merchandise wheat from Minneth, millet, honey, oil, and balm.
26Ezk 27:18 Damascus traded with you for your abundant goods--because of your great wealth of every kind--wine of Helbon, and white wool.
26Ezk 27:19 Vedan and Javan from Uzal entered into trade for your wares; wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were bartered for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:20 Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.
26Ezk 27:21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your favored dealers in lambs, rams, and goats; in these they did business with you.
26Ezk 27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; they exchanged for your wares the best of all kinds of spices, and all precious stones, and gold.
26Ezk 27:23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you.
26Ezk 27:24 These traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of blue and embroidered work, and in carpets of colored material, bound with cords and made secure; in these they traded with you.
26Ezk 27:25 The ships of Tarshish traveled for you in your trade. So you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 27:26 Your rowers have brought you into the high seas. The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 27:27 Your riches, your wares, your merchandise, your mariners and your pilots, your caulkers, your dealers in merchandise, and all your warriors within you, with all the company that is with you, sink into the heart of the seas on the day of your ruin.
26Ezk 27:28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside shakes,
26Ezk 27:29 and down from their ships come all that handle the oar. The mariners and all the pilots of the sea stand on the shore
26Ezk 27:30 and wail aloud over you, and cry bitterly. They throw dust on their heads and wallow in ashes;
26Ezk 27:31 they make themselves bald for you, and put on sackcloth, and they weep over you in bitterness of soul, with bitter mourning.
26Ezk 27:32 In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you, and lament over you: "Who was ever destroyed like Tyre in the midst of the sea?
26Ezk 27:33 When your wares came from the seas, you satisfied many peoples; with your abundant wealth and merchandise you enriched the kings of the earth.
26Ezk 27:34 Now you are wrecked by the seas, in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and all your crew have sunk with you.
26Ezk 27:35 All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you; and their kings are horribly afraid, their faces are convulsed.
26Ezk 27:36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever."
26Ezk 28:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:2 Mortal, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: Because your heart is proud and you have said, "I am a god; I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas," yet you are but a mortal, and no god, though you compare your mind with the mind of a god.
26Ezk 28:3 You are indeed wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you;
26Ezk 28:4 by your wisdom and your understanding you have amassed wealth for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries.
26Ezk 28:5 By your great wisdom in trade you have increased your wealth, and your heart has become proud in your wealth.
26Ezk 28:6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you compare your mind with the mind of a god,
26Ezk 28:7 therefore, I will bring strangers against you, the most terrible of the nations; they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.
26Ezk 28:8 They shall thrust you down to the Pit, and you shall die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
26Ezk 28:9 Will you still say, "I am a god," in the presence of those who kill you, though you are but a mortal, and no god, in the hands of those who wound you?
26Ezk 28:10 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:12 Mortal, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26Ezk 28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, carnelian, chrysolite, and moonstone, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald; and worked in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared.
26Ezk 28:14 With an anointed cherub as guardian I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the stones of fire.
26Ezk 28:15 You were blameless in your ways from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you.
26Ezk 28:16 In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian cherub drove you out from among the stones of fire.
26Ezk 28:17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.
26Ezk 28:18 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade, you profaned your sanctuaries. So I brought out fire from within you; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you.
26Ezk 28:19 All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever.
26Ezk 28:20 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:21 Mortal, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
26Ezk 28:22 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, O Sidon, and I will gain glory in your midst. They shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in it, and manifest my holiness in it;
26Ezk 28:23 for I will send pestilence into it, and bloodshed into its streets; and the dead shall fall in its midst, by the sword that is against it on every side. And they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 28:24 The house of Israel shall no longer find a pricking brier or a piercing thorn among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. And they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 28:25 Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall settle on their own soil that I gave to my servant Jacob.
26Ezk 28:26 They shall live in safety in it, and shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall live in safety, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. And they shall know that I am the LORD their God.
26Ezk 29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:2 Mortal, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt;
26Ezk 29:3 speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon sprawling in the midst of its channels, saying, "My Nile is my own; I made it for myself."
26Ezk 29:4 I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your channels stick to your scales. I will draw you up from your channels, with all the fish of your channels sticking to your scales.
26Ezk 29:5 I will fling you into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your channels; you shall fall in the open field, and not be gathered and buried. To the animals of the earth and to the birds of the air I have given you as food.
26Ezk 29:6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD because you were a staff of reed to the house of Israel;
26Ezk 29:7 when they grasped you with the hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and made all their legs unsteady.
26Ezk 29:8 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you human being and animal;
26Ezk 29:9 and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they shall know that I am the LORD. Because you said, "The Nile is mine, and I made it,"
26Ezk 29:10 therefore, I am against you, and against your channels, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.
26Ezk 29:11 No human foot shall pass through it, and no animal foot shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.
26Ezk 29:12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.
26Ezk 29:13 Further, thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered;
26Ezk 29:14 and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin; and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.
26Ezk 29:15 It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations; and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.
26Ezk 29:16 The Egyptians shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel; they will recall their iniquity, when they turned to them for aid. Then they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 29:17 In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:18 Mortal, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had expended against it.
26Ezk 29:19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will give the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army.
26Ezk 29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored, because they worked for me, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 29:21 On that day I will cause a horn to sprout up for the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 30:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:2 Mortal, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Wail, "Alas for the day!"
26Ezk 30:3 For a day is near, the day of the LORD is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
26Ezk 30:4 A sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt, and its wealth is carried away, and its foundations are torn down.
26Ezk 30:5 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all Arabia, and Libya, and the people of the allied land shall fall with them by the sword.
26Ezk 30:6 Thus says the LORD: Those who support Egypt shall fall, and its proud might shall come down; from Migdol to Syene they shall fall within it by the sword, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 30:7 They shall be desolated among other desolated countries, and their cities shall lie among cities laid waste.
26Ezk 30:8 Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set fire to Egypt, and all who help it are broken.
26Ezk 30:9 On that day, messengers shall go out from me in ships to terrify the unsuspecting Ethiopians; and anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt's doom; for it is coming!
26Ezk 30:10 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt, by the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.
26Ezk 30:11 He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
26Ezk 30:12 I will dry up the channels, and will sell the land into the hand of evildoers; I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it by the hand of foreigners; I the LORD have spoken.
26Ezk 30:13 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis; there shall no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; so I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 30:14 I will make Pathros a desolation, and will set fire to Zoan, and will execute acts of judgment on Thebes.
26Ezk 30:15 I will pour my wrath upon Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the hordes of Thebes.
26Ezk 30:16 I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium shall be in great agony; Thebes shall be breached, and Memphis face adversaries by day.
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of On and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and the cities themselves shall go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:18 At Tehaphnehes the day shall be dark, when I break there the dominion of Egypt, and its proud might shall come to an end; the city shall be covered by a cloud, and its daughter-towns shall go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:19 Thus I will execute acts of judgment on Egypt. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 30:20 In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:21 Mortal, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword.
26Ezk 30:22 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong arm and the one that was broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
26Ezk 30:23 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them throughout the lands.
26Ezk 30:24 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him with the groans of one mortally wounded.
26Ezk 30:25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall stretch it out against the land of Egypt,
26Ezk 30:26 and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 31:1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 31:2 Mortal, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: Whom are you like in your greatness?
26Ezk 31:3 Consider Assyria, a cedar of Lebanon, with fair branches and forest shade, and of great height, its top among the clouds.
26Ezk 31:4 The waters nourished it, the deep made it grow tall, making its rivers flow around the place it was planted, sending forth its streams to all the trees of the field.
26Ezk 31:5 So it towered high above all the trees of the field; its boughs grew large and its branches long, from abundant water in its shoots.
26Ezk 31:6 All the birds of the air made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth to their young; and in its shade all great nations lived.
26Ezk 31:7 It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its roots went down to abundant water.
26Ezk 31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor the fir trees equal its boughs; the plane trees were as nothing compared with its branches; no tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.
26Ezk 31:9 I made it beautiful with its mass of branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God.
26Ezk 31:10 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds, and its heart was proud of its height,
26Ezk 31:11 I gave it into the hand of the prince of the nations; he has dealt with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out.
26Ezk 31:12 Foreigners from the most terrible of the nations have cut it down and left it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs lie broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth went away from its shade and left it.
26Ezk 31:13 On its fallen trunk settle all the birds of the air, and among its boughs lodge all the wild animals.
26Ezk 31:14 All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height. For all of them are handed over to death, to the world below; along with all mortals, with those who go down to the Pit.
26Ezk 31:15 Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day it went down to Sheol I closed the deep over it and covered it; I restrained its rivers, and its mighty waters were checked. I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
26Ezk 31:16 I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that were well watered, were consoled in the world below.
26Ezk 31:17 They also went down to Sheol with it, to those killed by the sword, along with its allies, those who lived in its shade among the nations.
26Ezk 31:18 Which among the trees of Eden was like you in glory and in greatness? Now you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below; you shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his horde, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:2 Mortal, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: You consider yourself a lion among the nations, but you are like a dragon in the seas; you thrash about in your streams, trouble the water with your feet, and foul your streams.
26Ezk 32:3 Thus says the Lord GOD: In an assembly of many peoples I will throw my net over you; and I will haul you up in my dragnet.
26Ezk 32:4 I will throw you on the ground, on the open field I will fling you, and will cause all the birds of the air to settle on you, and I will let the wild animals of the whole earth gorge themselves with you.
26Ezk 32:5 I will strew your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your carcass.
26Ezk 32:6 I will drench the land with your flowing blood up to the mountains, and the watercourses will be filled with you.
26Ezk 32:7 When I blot you out, I will cover the heavens, and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
26Ezk 32:8 All the shining lights of the heavens I will darken above you, and put darkness on your land, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:9 I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, as I carry you captive among the nations, into countries you have not known.
26Ezk 32:10 I will make many peoples appalled at you; their kings shall shudder because of you. When I brandish my sword before them, they shall tremble every moment for their lives, each one of them, on the day of your downfall.
26Ezk 32:11 For thus says the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come against you.
26Ezk 32:12 I will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them most terrible among the nations. They shall bring to ruin the pride of Egypt, and all its hordes shall perish.
26Ezk 32:13 I will destroy all its livestock from beside abundant waters; and no human foot shall trouble them any more, nor shall the hoofs of cattle trouble them.
26Ezk 32:14 Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their streams to run like oil, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:15 When I make the land of Egypt desolate and when the land is stripped of all that fills it, when I strike down all who live in it, then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 32:16 This is a lamentation; it shall be chanted. The women of the nations shall chant it. Over Egypt and all its hordes they shall chant it, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:17 In the twelfth year, in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:18 Mortal, wail over the hordes of Egypt, and send them down, with Egypt and the daughters of majestic nations, to the world below, with those who go down to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:19 "Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down! Be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!"
26Ezk 32:20 They shall fall among those who are killed by the sword. Egypt has been handed over to the sword; carry away both it and its hordes.
26Ezk 32:21 The mighty chiefs shall speak of them, with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol: "They have come down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, killed by the sword."
26Ezk 32:22 Assyria is there, and all its company, their graves all around it, all of them killed, fallen by the sword.
26Ezk 32:23 Their graves are set in the uttermost parts of the Pit. Its company is all around its grave, all of them killed, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:24 Elam is there, and all its hordes around its grave; all of them killed, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the world below, who spread terror in the land of the living. They bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:25 They have made Elam a bed among the slain with all its hordes, their graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword; for terror of them was spread in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; they are placed among the slain.
26Ezk 32:26 Meshech and Tubal are there, and all their multitude, their graves all around them, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword; for they spread terror in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:27 And they do not lie with the fallen warriors of long ago who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were laid under their heads, and whose shields are upon their bones; for the terror of the warriors was in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:28 So you shall be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are killed by the sword.
26Ezk 32:29 Edom is there, its kings and all its princes, who for all their might are laid with those who are killed by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:30 The princes of the north are there, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down in shame with the slain, for all the terror that they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those who are killed by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:31 When Pharaoh sees them, he will be consoled for all his hordes--Pharaoh and all his army, killed by the sword, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 32:32 For he spread terror in the land of the living; therefore he shall be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword--Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 33:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:2 O Mortal, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one of their number as their sentinel;
26Ezk 33:3 and if the sentinel sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people;
26Ezk 33:4 then if any who hear the sound of the trumpet do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes them away, their blood shall be upon their own heads.
26Ezk 33:5 They heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; their blood shall be upon themselves. But if they had taken warning, they would have saved their lives.
26Ezk 33:6 But if the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any of them, they are taken away in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at the sentinel's hand.
26Ezk 33:7 So you, mortal, I have made a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
26Ezk 33:8 If I say to the wicked, "O wicked ones, you shall surely die," and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at your hand.
26Ezk 33:9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from their ways, and they do not turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but you will have saved your life.
26Ezk 33:10 Now you, mortal, say to the house of Israel, Thus you have said: "Our transgressions and our sins weigh upon us, and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?"
26Ezk 33:11 Say to them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from their ways and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?
26Ezk 33:12 And you, mortal, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not save them when they transgress; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, it shall not make them stumble when they turn from their wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by their righteousness when they sin.
26Ezk 33:13 Though I say to the righteous that they shall surely live, yet if they trust in their righteousness and commit iniquity, none of their righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that they have committed they shall die.
26Ezk 33:14 Again, though I say to the wicked, "You shall surely die," yet if they turn from their sin and do what is lawful and right--
26Ezk 33:15 if the wicked restore the pledge, give back what they have taken by robbery, and walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity--they shall surely live, they shall not die.
26Ezk 33:16 None of the sins that they have committed shall be remembered against them; they have done what is lawful and right, they shall surely live.
26Ezk 33:17 Yet your people say, "The way of the Lord is not just," when it is their own way that is not just.
26Ezk 33:18 When the righteous turn from their righteousness, and commit iniquity, they shall die for it.
26Ezk 33:19 And when the wicked turn from their wickedness, and do what is lawful and right, they shall live by it.
26Ezk 33:20 Yet you say, "The way of the Lord is not just." O house of Israel, I will judge all of you according to your ways!
26Ezk 33:21 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, someone who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has fallen."
26Ezk 33:22 Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; but he had opened my mouth by the time the fugitive came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer unable to speak.
26Ezk 33:23 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:24 Mortal, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, "Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess."
26Ezk 33:25 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
26Ezk 33:26 You depend on your swords, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
26Ezk 33:27 Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and those who are in the open field I will give to the wild animals to be devoured; and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
26Ezk 33:28 I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and its proud might shall come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through.
26Ezk 33:29 Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.
26Ezk 33:30 As for you, mortal, your people who talk together about you by the walls, and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to a neighbor, "Come and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD."
26Ezk 33:31 They come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not obey them. For flattery is on their lips, but their heart is set on their gain.
26Ezk 33:32 To them you are like a singer of love songs, one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; they hear what you say, but they will not do it.
26Ezk 33:33 When this comes--and come it will!--then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.
26Ezk 34:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 34:2 Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them--to the shepherds: Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?
26Ezk 34:3 You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.
26Ezk 34:4 You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.
26Ezk 34:5 So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.
26Ezk 34:6 My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.
26Ezk 34:7 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 34:8 As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;
26Ezk 34:9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
26Ezk 34:10 Thus says the Lord GOD, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.
26Ezk 34:11 For thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
26Ezk 34:12 As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.
26Ezk 34:13 I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.
26Ezk 34:14 I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 34:15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 34:16 I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.
26Ezk 34:17 As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats:
26Ezk 34:18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? When you drink of clear water, must you foul the rest with your feet?
26Ezk 34:19 And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?
26Ezk 34:20 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26Ezk 34:21 Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide,
26Ezk 34:22 I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
26Ezk 34:23 I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
26Ezk 34:24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 34:25 I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild animals from the land, so that they may live in the wild and sleep in the woods securely.
26Ezk 34:26 I will make them and the region around my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.
26Ezk 34:27 The trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase. They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the hands of those who enslaved them.
26Ezk 34:28 They shall no more be plunder for the nations, nor shall the animals of the land devour them; they shall live in safety, and no one shall make them afraid.
26Ezk 34:29 I will provide for them a splendid vegetation so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the insults of the nations.
26Ezk 34:30 They shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 34:31 You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture and I am your God, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 35:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 35:2 Mortal, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
26Ezk 35:3 and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, Mount Seir; I stretch out my hand against you to make you a desolation and a waste.
26Ezk 35:4 I lay your towns in ruins; you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:5 Because you cherished an ancient enmity, and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment;
26Ezk 35:6 therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed shall pursue you.
26Ezk 35:7 I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation; and I will cut off from it all who come and go.
26Ezk 35:8 I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses those killed with the sword shall fall.
26Ezk 35:9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall never be inhabited. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:10 Because you said, "These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them,"--although the LORD was there--
26Ezk 35:11 therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among you, when I judge you.
26Ezk 35:12 You shall know that I, the LORD, have heard all the abusive speech that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, "They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour."
26Ezk 35:13 And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it.
26Ezk 35:14 Thus says the Lord GOD: As the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
26Ezk 35:15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:1 And you, mortal, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 36:2 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, "Aha!" and, "The ancient heights have become our possession,"
26Ezk 36:3 therefore prophesy, and say: Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they made you desolate indeed, and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became an object of gossip and slander among the people;
26Ezk 36:4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted towns, which have become a source of plunder and an object of derision to the rest of the nations all around;
26Ezk 36:5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I am speaking in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who, with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, took my land as their possession, because of its pasture, to plunder it.
26Ezk 36:6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the watercourses and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am speaking in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the insults of the nations;
26Ezk 36:7 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer insults.
26Ezk 36:8 But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they shall soon come home.
26Ezk 36:9 See now, I am for you; I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown;
26Ezk 36:10 and I will multiply your population, the whole house of Israel, all of it; the towns shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt;
26Ezk 36:11 and I will multiply human beings and animals upon you. They shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:12 I will lead people upon you--my people Israel--and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance. No longer shall you bereave them of children.
26Ezk 36:13 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they say to you, "You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,"
26Ezk 36:14 therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, says the Lord GOD;
26Ezk 36:15 and no longer will I let you hear the insults of the nations, no longer shall you bear the disgrace of the peoples; and no longer shall you cause your nation to stumble, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 36:16 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 36:17 Mortal, when the house of Israel lived on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds; their conduct in my sight was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual period.
26Ezk 36:18 So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it.
26Ezk 36:19 I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them.
26Ezk 36:20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, "These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land."
26Ezk 36:21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.
26Ezk 36:22 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.
26Ezk 36:23 I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.
26Ezk 36:24 I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.
26Ezk 36:25 I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
26Ezk 36:26 A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26Ezk 36:27 I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.
26Ezk 36:28 Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
26Ezk 36:29 I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you.
26Ezk 36:30 I will make the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field abundant, so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.
26Ezk 36:31 Then you shall remember your evil ways, and your dealings that were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable deeds.
26Ezk 36:32 It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and dismayed for your ways, O house of Israel.
26Ezk 36:33 Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the towns to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:34 The land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.
26Ezk 36:35 And they will say, "This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are now inhabited and fortified."
26Ezk 36:36 Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it.
26Ezk 36:37 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will also let the house of Israel ask me to do this for them: to increase their population like a flock.
26Ezk 36:38 Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so shall the ruined towns be filled with flocks of people. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 37:1 The hand of the LORD came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones.
26Ezk 37:2 He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry.
26Ezk 37:3 He said to me, "Mortal, can these bones live?" I answered, "O Lord GOD, you know."
26Ezk 37:4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 37:5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.
26Ezk 37:6 I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 37:7 So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
26Ezk 37:8 I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them.
26Ezk 37:9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
26Ezk 37:10 I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.
26Ezk 37:11 Then he said to me, "Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.'
26Ezk 37:12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
26Ezk 37:13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people.
26Ezk 37:14 I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken and will act," says the LORD.
26Ezk 37:15 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 37:16 Mortal, take a stick and write on it, "For Judah, and the Israelites associated with it"; then take another stick and write on it, "For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with it";
26Ezk 37:17 and join them together into one stick, so that they may become one in your hand.
26Ezk 37:18 And when your people say to you, "Will you not show us what you mean by these?"
26Ezk 37:19 say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am about to take the stick of Joseph (which is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with it; and I will put the stick of Judah upon it, and make them one stick, in order that they may be one in my hand.
26Ezk 37:20 When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes,
26Ezk 37:21 then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from every quarter, and bring them to their own land.
26Ezk 37:22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all. Never again shall they be two nations, and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms.
26Ezk 37:23 They shall never again defile themselves with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. I will save them from all the apostasies into which they have fallen, and will cleanse them. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their GOD.
26Ezk 37:24 My servant David shall be king over them; and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall follow my ordinances and be careful to observe my statutes.
26Ezk 37:25 They shall live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your ancestors lived; they and their children and their children's children shall live there forever; and my servant David shall be their prince forever.
26Ezk 37:26 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will bless them and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forevermore.
26Ezk 37:27 My dwelling place shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
26Ezk 37:28 Then the nations shall know that I the LORD sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forevermore.
26Ezk 38:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 38:2 Mortal, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him
26Ezk 38:3 and say: Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal;
26Ezk 38:4 I will turn you around and put hooks into your jaws, and I will lead you out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company, all of them with shield and buckler, wielding swords.
26Ezk 38:5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Put are with them, all of them with buckler and helmet;
26Ezk 38:6 Gomer and all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remotest parts of the north with all its troops--many peoples are with you.
26Ezk 38:7 Be ready and keep ready, you and all the companies that are assembled around you, and hold yourselves in reserve for them.
26Ezk 38:8 After many days you shall be mustered; in the latter years you shall go against a land restored from war, a land where people were gathered from many nations on the mountains of Israel, which had long lain waste; its people were brought out from the nations and now are living in safety, all of them.
26Ezk 38:9 You shall advance, coming on like a storm; you shall be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.
26Ezk 38:10 Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme.
26Ezk 38:11 You will say, "I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will fall upon the quiet people who live in safety, all of them living without walls, and having no bars or gates";
26Ezk 38:12 to seize spoil and carry off plunder; to assail the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who are acquiring cattle and goods, who live at the center of the earth.
26Ezk 38:13 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its young warriors will say to you, "Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your horde to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to seize a great amount of booty?"
26Ezk 38:14 Therefore, mortal, prophesy, and say to Gog: Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are living securely, you will rouse yourself
26Ezk 38:15 and come from your place out of the remotest parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army;
26Ezk 38:16 you will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the earth. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I display my holiness before their eyes.
26Ezk 38:17 Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?
26Ezk 38:18 On that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, my wrath shall be aroused.
26Ezk 38:19 For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare: On that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
26Ezk 38:20 the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the animals of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all human beings that are on the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground.
26Ezk 38:21 I will summon the sword against Gog in all my mountains, says the Lord GOD; the swords of all will be against their comrades.
26Ezk 38:22 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him; and I will pour down torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur, upon him and his troops and the many peoples that are with him.
26Ezk 38:23 So I will display my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:1 And you, mortal, prophesy against Gog, and say: Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal!
26Ezk 39:2 I will turn you around and drive you forward, and bring you up from the remotest parts of the north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 39:3 I will strike your bow from your left hand, and will make your arrows drop out of your right hand.
26Ezk 39:4 You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples that are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every kind and to the wild animals to be devoured.
26Ezk 39:5 You shall fall in the open field; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:6 I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the coastlands; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:7 My holy name I will make known among my people Israel; and I will not let my holy name be profaned any more; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
26Ezk 39:8 It has come! It has happened, says the Lord GOD. This is the day of which I have spoken.
26Ezk 39:9 Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and make fires of the weapons and burn them--bucklers and shields, bows and arrows, handpikes and spears--and they will make fires of them for seven years.
26Ezk 39:10 They will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any trees in the forests, for they will make their fires of the weapons; they will despoil those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:11 On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers east of the sea; it shall block the path of the travelers, for there Gog and all his horde will be buried; it shall be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:12 Seven months the house of Israel shall spend burying them, in order to cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:13 All the people of the land shall bury them; and it will bring them honor on the day that I show my glory, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:14 They will set apart men to pass through the land regularly and bury any invaders who remain on the face of the land, so as to cleanse it; for seven months they shall make their search.
26Ezk 39:15 As the searchers pass through the land, anyone who sees a human bone shall set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:16 (A city Hamonah is there also.) Thus they shall cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:17 As for you, mortal, thus says the Lord GOD: Speak to the birds of every kind and to all the wild animals: Assemble and come, gather from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.
26Ezk 39:18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth--of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
26Ezk 39:19 You shall eat fat until you are filled, and drink blood until you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you.
26Ezk 39:20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with warriors and all kinds of soldiers, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 39:21 I will display my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.
26Ezk 39:22 The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.
26Ezk 39:23 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they dealt treacherously with me. So I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
26Ezk 39:24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.
26Ezk 39:25 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
26Ezk 39:26 They shall forget their shame, and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they live securely in their land with no one to make them afraid,
26Ezk 39:27 when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, and through them have displayed my holiness in the sight of many nations.
26Ezk 39:28 Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God because I sent them into exile among the nations, and then gathered them into their own land. I will leave none of them behind;
26Ezk 39:29 and I will never again hide my face from them, when I pour out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me there.
26Ezk 40:2 He brought me, in visions of God, to the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
26Ezk 40:3 When he brought me there, a man was there, whose appearance shone like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway.
26Ezk 40:4 The man said to me, "Mortal, look closely and listen attentively, and set your mind upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you; declare all that you see to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 40:5 Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area. The length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
26Ezk 40:6 Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. There were
26Ezk 40:7 recesses, and each recess was one reed wide and one reed deep; and the space between the recesses, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end was one reed deep.
26Ezk 40:8 Then he measured the inner vestibule of the gateway, one cubit.
26Ezk 40:9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its pilasters, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
26Ezk 40:10 There were three recesses on either side of the east gate; the three were of the same size; and the pilasters on either side were of the same size.
26Ezk 40:11 Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the width of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
26Ezk 40:12 There was a barrier before the recesses, one cubit on either side; and the recesses were six cubits on either side.
26Ezk 40:13 Then he measured the gate from the back of the one recess to the back of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, from wall to wall.
26Ezk 40:14 He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and the gate next to the pilaster on every side of the court.
26Ezk 40:15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
26Ezk 40:16 The recesses and their pilasters had windows, with shutters on the inside of the gateway all around, and the vestibules also had windows on the inside all around; and on the pilasters were palm trees.
26Ezk 40:17 Then he brought me into the outer court; there were chambers there, and a pavement, all around the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement.
26Ezk 40:18 The pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
26Ezk 40:19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, one hundred cubits.
26Ezk 40:20 Then he measured the gate of the outer court that faced north--its depth and width.
26Ezk 40:21 Its recesses, three on either side, and its pilasters and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:22 Its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. Seven steps led up to it; and its vestibule was on the inside.
26Ezk 40:23 Opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court; he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.
26Ezk 40:24 Then he led me toward the south, and there was a gate on the south; and he measured its pilasters and its vestibule; they had the same dimensions as the others.
26Ezk 40:25 There were windows all around in it and in its vestibule, like the windows of the others; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:26 There were seven steps leading up to it; its vestibule was on the inside. It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on either side.
26Ezk 40:27 There was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.
26Ezk 40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same dimensions as the others.
26Ezk 40:29 Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:30 There were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits deep and five cubits wide.
26Ezk 40:31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pilasters, and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others.
26Ezk 40:33 Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same dimensions as the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:34 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters, on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same dimensions as the others.
26Ezk 40:36 Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and it had windows all around. Its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26Ezk 40:37 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters, on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:38 There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.
26Ezk 40:39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
26Ezk 40:40 On the outside of the vestibule at the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
26Ezk 40:41 Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
26Ezk 40:42 There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
26Ezk 40:43 There were pegs, one handbreadth long, fastened all around the inside. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
26Ezk 40:44 On the outside of the inner gateway there were chambers for the singers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the east gate facing north.
26Ezk 40:45 He said to me, "This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
26Ezk 40:46 and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the descendants of Zadok, who alone among the descendants of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him."
26Ezk 40:47 He measured the court, one hundred cubits deep, and one hundred cubits wide, a square; and the altar was in front of the temple.
26Ezk 40:48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the pilasters of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.
26Ezk 40:49 The depth of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width twelve cubits; ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars beside the pilasters on either side.
26Ezk 41:1 Then he brought me to the nave, and measured the pilasters; on each side six cubits was the width of the pilasters.
26Ezk 41:2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. He measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.
26Ezk 41:3 Then he went into the inner room and measured the pilasters of the entrance, two cubits; and the width of the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance, seven cubits.
26Ezk 41:4 He measured the depth of the room, twenty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits, beyond the nave. And he said to me, This is the most holy place.
26Ezk 41:5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple.
26Ezk 41:6 The side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.
26Ezk 41:7 The passageway of the side chambers widened from story to story; for the structure was supplied with a stairway all around the temple. For this reason the structure became wider from story to story. One ascended from the bottom story to the uppermost story by way of the middle one.
26Ezk 41:8 I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits.
26Ezk 41:9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits; and the free space between the side chambers of the temple
26Ezk 41:10 and the chambers of the court was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
26Ezk 41:11 The side chambers opened onto the area left free, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the width of the part that was left free was five cubits all around.
26Ezk 41:12 The building that was facing the temple yard on the west side was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its depth ninety cubits.
26Ezk 41:13 Then he measured the temple, one hundred cubits deep; and the yard and the building with its walls, one hundred cubits deep;
26Ezk 41:14 also the width of the east front of the temple and the yard, one hundred cubits.
26Ezk 41:15 Then he measured the depth of the building facing the yard at the west, together with its galleries on either side, one hundred cubits. The nave of the temple and the inner room and the outer vestibule
26Ezk 41:16 were paneled, and, all around, all three had windows with recessed frames. Facing the threshold the temple was paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
26Ezk 41:17 to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around in the inner room and the nave there was a pattern.
26Ezk 41:18 It was formed of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Each cherub had two faces:
26Ezk 41:19 a human face turned toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion turned toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around;
26Ezk 41:20 from the floor to the area above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall.
26Ezk 41:21 The doorposts of the nave were square. In front of the holy place was something resembling
26Ezk 41:22 an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits wide; its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, "This is the table that stands before the LORD."
26Ezk 41:23 The nave and the holy place had each a double door.
26Ezk 41:24 The doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door.
26Ezk 41:25 On the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside.
26Ezk 41:26 And there were recessed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule.
26Ezk 42:1 Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the temple yard and opposite the building on the north.
26Ezk 42:2 The length of the building that was on the north side was one hundred cubits, and the width fifty cubits.
26Ezk 42:3 Across the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, the chambers rose gallery by gallery in three stories.
26Ezk 42:4 In front of the chambers was a passage on the inner side, ten cubits wide and one hundred cubits deep, and its entrances were on the north.
26Ezk 42:5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers in the building.
26Ezk 42:6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the outer court; for this reason the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
26Ezk 42:7 There was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long.
26Ezk 42:8 For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the temple were one hundred cubits long.
26Ezk 42:9 At the foot of these chambers ran a passage that one entered from the east in order to enter them from the outer court.
26Ezk 42:10 The width of the passage is fixed by the wall of the court. On the south also, opposite the vacant area and opposite the building, there were chambers
26Ezk 42:11 with a passage in front of them; they were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and width, with the same exits and arrangements and doors.
26Ezk 42:12 So the entrances of the chambers to the south were entered through the entrance at the head of the corresponding passage, from the east, along the matching wall.
26Ezk 42:13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the vacant area are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings; there they shall deposit the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, for the place is holy.
26Ezk 42:14 When the priests enter the holy place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the vestments in which they minister, for these are holy; they shall put on other garments before they go near to the area open to the people."
26Ezk 42:15 When he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faces east, and measured the temple area all around.
26Ezk 42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:17 Then he turned and measured the north side, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:18 Then he turned and measured the south side, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed.
26Ezk 42:20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to make a separation between the holy and the common.
26Ezk 43:1 Then he brought me to the gate, the gate facing east.
26Ezk 43:2 And there, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east; the sound was like the sound of mighty waters; and the earth shone with his glory.
26Ezk 43:3 The vision I saw was like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the vision that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
26Ezk 43:4 As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east,
26Ezk 43:5 the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
26Ezk 43:6 While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me out of the temple.
26Ezk 43:7 He said to me: Mortal, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will reside among the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their whoring, and by the corpses of their kings at their death.
26Ezk 43:8 When they placed their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they were defiling my holy name by their abominations that they committed; therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
26Ezk 43:9 Now let them put away their idolatry and the corpses of their kings far from me, and I will reside among them forever.
26Ezk 43:10 As for you, mortal, describe the temple to the house of Israel, and let them measure the pattern; and let them be ashamed of their iniquities.
26Ezk 43:11 When they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the plan of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, and its whole form--all its ordinances and its entire plan and all its laws; and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe and follow the entire plan and all its ordinances.
26Ezk 43:12 This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. This is the law of the temple.
26Ezk 43:13 These are the dimensions of the altar by cubits (the cubit being one cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high, and one cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. This shall be the height of the altar:
26Ezk 43:14 From the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a width of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a width of one cubit;
26Ezk 43:15 and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns.
26Ezk 43:16 The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve wide.
26Ezk 43:17 The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide, with a rim around it half a cubit wide, and its surrounding base, one cubit. Its steps shall face east.
26Ezk 43:18 Then he said to me: Mortal, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and for dashing blood against it,
26Ezk 43:19 you shall give to the levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, says the Lord GOD, a bull for a sin offering.
26Ezk 43:20 And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim all around; thus you shall purify it and make atonement for it.
26Ezk 43:21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.
26Ezk 43:22 On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull.
26Ezk 43:23 When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.
26Ezk 43:24 You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
26Ezk 43:25 For seven days you shall provide daily a goat for a sin offering; also a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.
26Ezk 43:26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it.
26Ezk 43:27 When these days are over, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer upon the altar your burnt offerings and your offerings of well-being; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 44:1 Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; and it was shut.
26Ezk 44:2 The LORD said to me: This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it shall remain shut.
26Ezk 44:3 Only the prince, because he is a prince, may sit in it to eat food before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by the same way.
26Ezk 44:4 Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; and I looked, and lo! the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD; and I fell upon my face.
26Ezk 44:5 The LORD said to me: Mortal, mark well, look closely, and listen attentively to all that I shall tell you concerning all the ordinances of the temple of the LORD and all its laws; and mark well those who may be admitted to the temple and all those who are to be excluded from the sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:6 Say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: O house of Israel, let there be an end to all your abominations
26Ezk 44:7 in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning my temple when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant with all your abominations.
26Ezk 44:8 And you have not kept charge of my sacred offerings; but you have appointed foreigners to act for you in keeping my charge in my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:9 Thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, shall enter my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:10 But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment.
26Ezk 44:11 They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving in the temple; they shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall attend on them and serve them.
26Ezk 44:12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and made the house of Israel stumble into iniquity, therefore I have sworn concerning them, says the Lord GOD, that they shall bear their punishment.
26Ezk 44:13 They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any of my sacred offerings, the things that are most sacred; but they shall bear their shame, and the consequences of the abominations that they have committed.
26Ezk 44:14 Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its chores, all that is to be done in it.
26Ezk 44:15 But the levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall attend me to offer me the fat and the blood, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 44:16 It is they who shall enter my sanctuary, it is they who shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
26Ezk 44:17 When they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen vestments; they shall have nothing of wool on them, while they minister at the gates of the inner court, and within.
26Ezk 44:18 They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and linen undergarments on their loins; they shall not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat.
26Ezk 44:19 When they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall remove the vestments in which they have been ministering, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, so that they may not communicate holiness to the people with their vestments.
26Ezk 44:20 They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads.
26Ezk 44:21 No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.
26Ezk 44:22 They shall not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, but only a virgin of the stock of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
26Ezk 44:23 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
26Ezk 44:24 In a controversy they shall act as judges, and they shall decide it according to my judgments. They shall keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my appointed festivals, and they shall keep my sabbaths holy.
26Ezk 44:25 They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person; for father or mother, however, and for son or daughter, and for brother or unmarried sister they may defile themselves.
26Ezk 44:26 After he has become clean, they shall count seven days for him.
26Ezk 44:27 On the day that he goes into the holy place, into the inner court, to minister in the holy place, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 44:28 This shall be their inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no holding in Israel; I am their holding.
26Ezk 44:29 They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
26Ezk 44:30 The first of all the first fruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests; you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, in order that a blessing may rest on your house.
26Ezk 44:31 The priests shall not eat of anything, whether bird or animal, that died of itself or was torn by animals.
26Ezk 45:1 When you allot the land as an inheritance, you shall set aside for the LORD a portion of the land as a holy district, twenty-five thousand cubits long and twenty thousand cubits wide; it shall be holy throughout its entire extent.
26Ezk 45:2 Of this, a square plot of five hundred by five hundred cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it.
26Ezk 45:3 In the holy district you shall measure off a section twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide, in which shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
26Ezk 45:4 It shall be a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him; and it shall be both a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:5 Another section, twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits wide, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their holding for cities to live in.
26Ezk 45:6 Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign as a holding for the city an area five thousand cubits wide, and twenty-five thousand cubits long; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:7 And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district and the holding of the city, alongside the holy district and the holding of the city, on the west and on the east, corresponding in length to one of the tribal portions, and extending from the western to the eastern boundary
26Ezk 45:8 of the land. It is to be his property in Israel. And my princes shall no longer oppress my people; but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes.
26Ezk 45:9 Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression, and do what is just and right. Cease your evictions of my people, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 45:10 You shall have honest balances, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.
26Ezk 45:11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, the bath containing one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; the homer shall be the standard measure.
26Ezk 45:12 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall make a mina for you.
26Ezk 45:13 This is the offering that you shall make: one-sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley,
26Ezk 45:14 and as the fixed portion of oil, one-tenth of a bath from each cor (the cor, like the homer, contains ten baths);
26Ezk 45:15 and one sheep from every flock of two hundred, from the pastures of Israel. This is the offering for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and offerings of well-being, to make atonement for them, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 45:16 All the people of the land shall join with the prince in Israel in making this offering.
26Ezk 45:17 But this shall be the obligation of the prince regarding the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the festivals, the new moons, and the sabbaths, all the appointed festivals of the house of Israel: he shall provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, the burnt offerings, and the offerings of well-being, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:18 Thus says the Lord GOD: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish, and purify the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and the posts of the gate of the inner court.
26Ezk 45:20 You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the temple.
26Ezk 45:21 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall celebrate the festival of the passover, and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.
26Ezk 45:22 On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a young bull for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:23 And during the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish, on each of the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:24 He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 45:25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven days of the festival, he shall make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, and grain offerings, and for the oil.
26Ezk 46:1 Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall remain closed on the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
26Ezk 46:2 The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from outside, and shall take his stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his offerings of well-being, and he shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be closed until evening.
26Ezk 46:3 The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
26Ezk 46:4 The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
26Ezk 46:5 and the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he wishes to give, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 46:6 On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish;
26Ezk 46:7 as a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wishes, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
26Ezk 46:8 When the prince enters, he shall come in by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
26Ezk 46:9 When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed festivals, whoever enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: they shall not return by way of the gate by which they entered, but shall go out straight ahead.
26Ezk 46:10 When they come in, the prince shall come in with them; and when they go out, he shall go out.
26Ezk 46:11 At the festivals and the appointed seasons the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one wishes to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.
26Ezk 46:12 When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or offerings of well-being as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him; and he shall offer his burnt offering or his offerings of well-being as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be closed.
26Ezk 46:13 He shall provide a lamb, a yearling, without blemish, for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning he shall provide it.
26Ezk 46:14 And he shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning regularly, one-sixth of an ephah, and one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the choice flour, as a grain offering to the LORD; this is the ordinance for all time.
26Ezk 46:15 Thus the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, as a regular burnt offering.
26Ezk 46:16 Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons out of his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons, it is their holding by inheritance.
26Ezk 46:17 But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance.
26Ezk 46:18 The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their holding; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own holding, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of their holding.
26Ezk 46:19 Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw a place at the extreme western end of them.
26Ezk 46:20 He said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people."
26Ezk 46:21 Then he brought me out to the outer court, and led me past the four corners of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court--
26Ezk 46:22 in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; the four were of the same size.
26Ezk 46:23 On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around.
26Ezk 46:24 Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who serve at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
26Ezk 47:1 Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple; there, water was flowing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.
26Ezk 47:2 Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and the water was coming out on the south side.
26Ezk 47:3 Going on eastward with a cord in his hand, the man measured one thousand cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep.
26Ezk 47:4 Again he measured one thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured one thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the waist.
26Ezk 47:5 Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.
26Ezk 47:6 He said to me, "Mortal, have you seen this?" Then he led me back along the bank of the river.
26Ezk 47:7 As I came back, I saw on the bank of the river a great many trees on the one side and on the other.
26Ezk 47:8 He said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the sea, the sea of stagnant waters, the water will become fresh.
26Ezk 47:9 Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there. It will become fresh; and everything will live where the river goes.
26Ezk 47:10 People will stand fishing beside the sea from En-gedi to En-eglaim; it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of a great many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.
26Ezk 47:11 But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
26Ezk 47:12 On the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."
26Ezk 47:13 Thus says the Lord GOD: These are the boundaries by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
26Ezk 47:14 You shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your ancestors, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
26Ezk 47:15 This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to Zedad,
26Ezk 47:16 Berothah, Sibraim (which lies between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26Ezk 47:17 So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enon, which is north of the border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side.
26Ezk 47:18 On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.
26Ezk 47:19 On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, from there along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.
26Ezk 47:20 On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This shall be the west side.
26Ezk 47:21 So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:22 You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as citizens of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:23 In whatever tribe aliens reside, there you shall assign them their inheritance, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 48:1 These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern border, on the Hethlon road, from Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enon (which is on the border of Damascus, with Hamath to the north), and extending from the east side to the west, Dan, one portion.
26Ezk 48:2 Adjoining the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher, one portion.
26Ezk 48:3 Adjoining the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, Naphtali, one portion.
26Ezk 48:4 Adjoining the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, Manasseh, one portion.
26Ezk 48:5 Adjoining the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, Ephraim, one portion.
26Ezk 48:6 Adjoining the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, Reuben, one portion.
26Ezk 48:7 Adjoining the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, Judah, one portion.
26Ezk 48:8 Adjoining the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the portion that you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand cubits in width, and in length equal to one of the tribal portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:9 The portion that you shall set apart for the LORD shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and twenty thousand in width.
26Ezk 48:10 These shall be the allotments of the holy portion: the priests shall have an allotment measuring twenty-five thousand cubits on the northern side, ten thousand cubits in width on the western side, ten thousand in width on the eastern side, and twenty-five thousand in length on the southern side, with the sanctuary of the LORD in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:11 This shall be for the consecrated priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept my charge, who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.
26Ezk 48:12 It shall belong to them as a special portion from the holy portion of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the territory of the Levites.
26Ezk 48:13 Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an allotment twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width. The whole length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the width twenty thousand.
26Ezk 48:14 They shall not sell or exchange any of it; they shall not transfer this choice portion of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.
26Ezk 48:15 The remainder, five thousand cubits in width and twenty-five thousand in length, shall be for ordinary use for the city, for dwellings and for open country. In the middle of it shall be the city;
26Ezk 48:16 and these shall be its dimensions: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
26Ezk 48:17 The city shall have open land: on the north two hundred fifty cubits, on the south two hundred fifty, on the east two hundred fifty, on the west two hundred fifty.
26Ezk 48:18 The remainder of the length alongside the holy portion shall be ten thousand cubits to the east, and ten thousand to the west, and it shall be alongside the holy portion. Its produce shall be food for the workers of the city.
26Ezk 48:19 The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it.
26Ezk 48:20 The whole portion that you shall set apart shall be twenty-five thousand cubits square, that is, the holy portion together with the property of the city.
26Ezk 48:21 What remains on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city shall belong to the prince. Extending from the twenty-five thousand cubits of the holy portion to the east border, and westward from the twenty-five thousand cubits to the west border, parallel to the tribal portions, it shall belong to the prince. The holy portion with the sanctuary of the temple in the middle of it,
26Ezk 48:22 and the property of the Levites and of the city, shall be in the middle of that which belongs to the prince. The portion of the prince shall lie between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin.
26Ezk 48:23 As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, Benjamin, one portion.
26Ezk 48:24 Adjoining the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon, one portion.
26Ezk 48:25 Adjoining the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar, one portion.
26Ezk 48:26 Adjoining the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun, one portion.
26Ezk 48:27 Adjoining the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad, one portion.
26Ezk 48:28 And adjoining the territory of Gad to the south, the boundary shall run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, from there along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea.
26Ezk 48:29 This is the land that you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, says the Lord GOD.
26Ezk 48:30 These shall be the exits of the city: On the north side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure,
26Ezk 48:31 three gates, the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi, the gates of the city being named after the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 48:32 On the east side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates, the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan.
26Ezk 48:33 On the south side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure, three gates, the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar, and the gate of Zebulun.
26Ezk 48:34 On the west side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates, the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher, and the gate of Naphtali.
26Ezk 48:35 The circumference of the city shall be eighteen thousand cubits. And the name of the city from that time on shall be, The LORD is There.

27Dn 1:1 In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
27Dn 1:2 The Lord let King Jehoiakim of Judah fall into his power, as well as some of the vessels of the house of God. These he brought to the land of Shinar, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his gods.
27Dn 1:3 Then the king commanded his palace master Ashpenaz to bring some of the Israelites of the royal family and of the nobility,
27Dn 1:4 young men without physical defect and handsome, versed in every branch of wisdom, endowed with knowledge and insight, and competent to serve in the king's palace; they were to be taught the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
27Dn 1:5 The king assigned them a daily portion of the royal rations of food and wine. They were to be educated for three years, so that at the end of that time they could be stationed in the king's court.
27Dn 1:6 Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the tribe of Judah.
27Dn 1:7 The palace master gave them other names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.
27Dn 1:8 But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the royal rations of food and wine; so he asked the palace master to allow him not to defile himself.
27Dn 1:9 Now God allowed Daniel to receive favor and compassion from the palace master.
27Dn 1:10 The palace master said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king; he has appointed your food and your drink. If he should see you in poorer condition than the other young men of your own age, you would endanger my head with the king."
27Dn 1:11 Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
27Dn 1:12 "Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27Dn 1:13 You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations, and deal with your servants according to what you observe."
27Dn 1:14 So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days.
27Dn 1:15 At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations.
27Dn 1:16 So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
27Dn 1:17 To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams.
27Dn 1:18 At the end of the time that the king had set for them to be brought in, the palace master brought them into the presence of Nebuchadnezzar,
27Dn 1:19 and the king spoke with them. And among them all, no one was found to compare with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they were stationed in the king's court.
27Dn 1:20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
27Dn 1:21 And Daniel continued there until the first year of King Cyrus.
27Dn 2:1 In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed such dreams that his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.
27Dn 2:2 So the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. When they came in and stood before the king,
27Dn 2:3 he said to them, "I have had such a dream that my spirit is troubled by the desire to understand it."
27Dn 2:4 The Chaldeans said to the king (in Aramaic), "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the interpretation."
27Dn 2:5 The king answered the Chaldeans, "This is a public decree: if you do not tell me both the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins.
27Dn 2:6 But if you do tell me the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation."
27Dn 2:7 They answered a second time, "Let the king first tell his servants the dream, then we can give its interpretation."
27Dn 2:8 The king answered, "I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see I have firmly decreed:
27Dn 2:9 if you do not tell me the dream, there is but one verdict for you. You have agreed to speak lying and misleading words to me until things take a turn. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation."
27Dn 2:10 The Chaldeans answered the king, "There is no one on earth who can reveal what the king demands! In fact no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.
27Dn 2:11 The thing that the king is asking is too difficult, and no one can reveal it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals."
27Dn 2:12 Because of this the king flew into a violent rage and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
27Dn 2:13 The decree was issued, and the wise men were about to be executed; and they looked for Daniel and his companions, to execute them.
27Dn 2:14 Then Daniel responded with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the king's chief executioner, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon;
27Dn 2:15 he asked Arioch, the royal official, "Why is the decree of the king so urgent?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
27Dn 2:16 So Daniel went in and requested that the king give him time and he would tell the king the interpretation.
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
27Dn 2:18 and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish.
27Dn 2:19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
27Dn 2:20 Daniel said: "Blessed be the name of God from age to age, for wisdom and power are his.
27Dn 2:21 He changes times and seasons, deposes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.
27Dn 2:22 He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with him.
27Dn 2:23 To you, O God of my ancestors, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and power, and have now revealed to me what we asked of you, for you have revealed to us what the king ordered."
27Dn 2:24 Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation."
27Dn 2:25 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can tell the king the interpretation."
27Dn 2:26 The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"
27Dn 2:27 Daniel answered the king, "No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners can show to the king the mystery that the king is asking,
27Dn 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has disclosed to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at the end of days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed were these:
27Dn 2:29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed, came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and the revealer of mysteries disclosed to you what is to be.
27Dn 2:30 But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living being, but in order that the interpretation may be known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
27Dn 2:31 "You were looking, O king, and lo! there was a great statue. This statue was huge, its brilliance extraordinary; it was standing before you, and its appearance was frightening.
27Dn 2:32 The head of that statue was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,
27Dn 2:33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
27Dn 2:34 As you looked on, a stone was cut out, not by human hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.
27Dn 2:35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
27Dn 2:36 "This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.
27Dn 2:37 You, O king, the king of kings--to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the might, and the glory,
27Dn 2:38 into whose hand he has given human beings, wherever they live, the wild animals of the field, and the birds of the air, and whom he has established as ruler over them all--you are the head of gold.
27Dn 2:39 After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over the whole earth.
27Dn 2:40 And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron; just as iron crushes and smashes everything, it shall crush and shatter all these.
27Dn 2:41 As you saw the feet and toes partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but some of the strength of iron shall be in it, as you saw the iron mixed with the clay.
27Dn 2:42 As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
27Dn 2:43 As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so will they mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.
27Dn 2:44 And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall this kingdom be left to another people. It shall crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever;
27Dn 2:45 just as you saw that a stone was cut from the mountain not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has informed the king what shall be hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation trustworthy."
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that a grain offering and incense be offered to him.
27Dn 2:47 The king said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!"
27Dn 2:48 Then the king promoted Daniel, gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:49 Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court.
27Dn 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue whose height was sixty cubits and whose width was six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 3:2 Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent for the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to assemble and come to the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:3 So the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. When they were standing before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up,
27Dn 3:4 the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
27Dn 3:5 that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27Dn 3:6 Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire."
27Dn 3:7 Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:8 Accordingly, at this time certain Chaldeans came forward and denounced the Jews.
27Dn 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!
27Dn 3:10 You, O king, have made a decree, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, shall fall down and worship the golden statue,
27Dn 3:11 and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:12 There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These pay no heed to you, O King. They do not serve your gods and they do not worship the golden statue that you have set up."
27Dn 3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought in; so they brought those men before the king.
27Dn 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods and you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up?
27Dn 3:15 Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble to fall down and worship the statue that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire, and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?"
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter.
27Dn 3:17 If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and out of your hand, O king, let him deliver us.
27Dn 3:18 But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up."
27Dn 3:19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary,
27Dn 3:20 and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and threw them into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:21 So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:22 Because the king's command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
27Dn 3:23 But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up quickly. He said to his counselors, "Was it not three men that we threw bound into the fire?" They answered the king, "True, O king."
27Dn 3:25 He replied, "But I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the fourth has the appearance of a god."
27Dn 3:26 Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.
27Dn 3:27 And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their tunics were not harmed, and not even the smell of fire came from them.
27Dn 3:28 Nebuchadnezzar said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king's command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.
27Dn 3:29 Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."
27Dn 3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 4:1 King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May you have abundant prosperity!
27Dn 4:2 The signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me I am pleased to recount.
27Dn 4:3 How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living at ease in my home and prospering in my palace.
27Dn 4:5 I saw a dream that frightened me; my fantasies in bed and the visions of my head terrified me.
27Dn 4:6 So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, in order that they might tell me the interpretation of the dream.
27Dn 4:7 Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not tell me its interpretation.
27Dn 4:8 At last Daniel came in before me--he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and who is endowed with a spirit of the holy gods--and I told him the dream:
27Dn 4:9 "O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery is too difficult for you. Hear the dream that I saw; tell me its interpretation.
27Dn 4:10 Upon my bed this is what I saw; there was a tree at the center of the earth, and its height was great.
27Dn 4:11 The tree grew great and strong, its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.
27Dn 4:12 Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit abundant, and it provided food for all. The animals of the field found shade under it, the birds of the air nested in its branches, and from it all living beings were fed.
27Dn 4:13 I continued looking, in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and there was a holy watcher, coming down from heaven.
27Dn 4:14 He cried aloud and said: 'Cut down the tree and chop off its branches, strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from beneath it and the birds from its branches.
27Dn 4:15 But leave its stump and roots in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be bathed with the dew of heaven. and let his lot be with the animals of the field in the grass of the earth.
27Dn 4:16 Let his mind be changed from that of a human, and let the mind of an animal be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.
27Dn 4:17 The sentence is rendered by decree of the watchers, the decision is given by order of the holy ones, in order that all who live may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals; he gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of human beings.'
27Dn 4:18 This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to tell me the interpretation. You are able, however, for you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods."
27Dn 4:19 Then Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar, was severely distressed for a while. His thoughts terrified him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or the interpretation terrify you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies!
27Dn 4:20 The tree that you saw, which grew great and strong, so that its top reached to heaven and was visible to the end of the whole earth,
27Dn 4:21 whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and which provided food for all, under which animals of the field lived, and in whose branches the birds of the air had nests--
27Dn 4:22 it is you, O king! You have grown great and strong. Your greatness has increased and reaches to heaven, and your sovereignty to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:23 And whereas the king saw a holy watcher coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave its stump and roots in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field; and let him be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his lot be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him'--
27Dn 4:24 this is the interpretation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:
27Dn 4:25 You shall be driven away from human society, and your dwelling shall be with the wild animals. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen, you shall be bathed with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals, and gives it to whom he will.
27Dn 4:26 As it was commanded to leave the stump and roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be reestablished for you from the time that you learn that Heaven is sovereign.
27Dn 4:27 Therefore, O king, may my counsel be acceptable to you: atone for your sins with righteousness, and your iniquities with mercy to the oppressed, so that your prosperity may be prolonged."
27Dn 4:28 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 4:29 At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
27Dn 4:30 and the king said, "Is this not magnificent Babylon, which I have built as a royal capital by my mighty power and for my glorious majesty?"
27Dn 4:31 While the words were still in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven: "O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has departed from you!
27Dn 4:32 You shall be driven away from human society, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals and gives it to whom he will."
27Dn 4:33 Immediately the sentence was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven away from human society, ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers and his nails became like birds' claws.
27Dn 4:34 When that period was over, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me. I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored the one who lives forever. For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:35 All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does what he wills with the host of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. There is no one who can stay his hand or say to him, "What are you doing?"
27Dn 4:36 At that time my reason returned to me; and my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom. My counselors and my lords sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.
27Dn 4:37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways are justice; and he is able to bring low those who walk in pride.
27Dn 5:1 King Belshazzar made a great festival for a thousand of his lords, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand.
27Dn 5:2 Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar commanded that they bring in the vessels of gold and silver that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
27Dn 5:3 So they brought in the vessels of gold and silver that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
27Dn 5:4 They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27Dn 5:5 Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall of the royal palace, next to the lampstand. The king was watching the hand as it wrote.
27Dn 5:6 Then the king's face turned pale, and his thoughts terrified him. His limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together.
27Dn 5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners; and the king said to the wise men of Babylon, "Whoever can read this writing and tell me its interpretation shall be clothed in purple, have a chain of gold around his neck, and rank third in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:8 Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king the interpretation.
27Dn 5:9 Then King Belshazzar became greatly terrified and his face turned pale, and his lords were perplexed.
27Dn 5:10 The queen, when she heard the discussion of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall. The queen said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts terrify you or your face grow pale.
27Dn 5:11 There is a man in your kingdom who is endowed with a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father he was found to have enlightenment, understanding, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners,
27Dn 5:12 because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation."
27Dn 5:13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, "So you are Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?
27Dn 5:14 I have heard of you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that enlightenment, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you.
27Dn 5:15 Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and tell me its interpretation, but they were not able to give the interpretation of the matter.
27Dn 5:16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you are able to read the writing and tell me its interpretation, you shall be clothed in purple, have a chain of gold around your neck, and rank third in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:17 Then Daniel answered in the presence of the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, or give your rewards to someone else! Nevertheless I will read the writing to the king and let him know the interpretation.
27Dn 5:18 O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar kingship, greatness, glory, and majesty.
27Dn 5:19 And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed those he wanted to kill, kept alive those he wanted to keep alive, honored those he wanted to honor, and degraded those he wanted to degrade.
27Dn 5:20 But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he acted proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was stripped from him.
27Dn 5:21 He was driven from human society, and his mind was made like that of an animal. His dwelling was with the wild asses, he was fed grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals, and sets over it whomever he will.
27Dn 5:22 And you, Belshazzar his son, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this!
27Dn 5:23 You have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven! The vessels of his temple have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know; but the God in whose power is your very breath, and to whom belong all your ways, you have not honored.
27Dn 5:24 "So from his presence the hand was sent and this writing was inscribed.
27Dn 5:25 And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN.
27Dn 5:26 This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;
27Dn 5:27 TEKEL, you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting;
27Dn 5:28 PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."
27Dn 5:29 Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made concerning him that he should rank third in the kingdom.
27Dn 5:30 That very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed.
27Dn 5:31 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
27Dn 6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, stationed throughout the whole kingdom,
27Dn 6:2 and over them three presidents, including Daniel; to these the satraps gave account, so that the king might suffer no loss.
27Dn 6:3 Soon Daniel distinguished himself above all the other presidents and satraps because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
27Dn 6:4 So the presidents and the satraps tried to find grounds for complaint against Daniel in connection with the kingdom. But they could find no grounds for complaint or any corruption, because he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption could be found in him.
27Dn 6:5 The men said, "We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God."
27Dn 6:6 So the presidents and satraps conspired and came to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever!
27Dn 6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict, that whoever prays to anyone, divine or human, for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into a den of lions.
27Dn 6:8 Now, O king, establish the interdict and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked."
27Dn 6:9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and interdict.
27Dn 6:10 Although Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he continued to go to his house, which had windows in its upper room open toward Jerusalem, and to get down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him, just as he had done previously.
27Dn 6:11 The conspirators came and found Daniel praying and seeking mercy before his God.
27Dn 6:12 Then they approached the king and said concerning the interdict, "O king! Did you not sign an interdict, that anyone who prays to anyone, divine or human, within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be thrown into a den of lions?" The king answered, "The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked."
27Dn 6:13 Then they responded to the king, "Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the interdict you have signed, but he is saying his prayers three times a day."
27Dn 6:14 When the king heard the charge, he was very much distressed. He was determined to save Daniel, and until the sun went down he made every effort to rescue him.
27Dn 6:15 Then the conspirators came to the king and said to him, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no interdict or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed."
27Dn 6:16 Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you faithfully serve, deliver you!"
27Dn 6:17 A stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
27Dn 6:18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no food was brought to him, and sleep fled from him.
27Dn 6:19 Then, at break of day, the king got up and hurried to the den of lions.
27Dn 6:20 When he came near the den where Daniel was, he cried out anxiously to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you faithfully serve been able to deliver you from the lions?"
27Dn 6:21 Daniel then said to the king, "O king, live forever!
27Dn 6:22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths so that they would not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong."
27Dn 6:23 Then the king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
27Dn 6:24 The king gave a command, and those who had accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the den of lions--they, their children, and their wives. Before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
27Dn 6:25 Then King Darius wrote to all peoples and nations of every language throughout the whole world: "May you have abundant prosperity!
27Dn 6:26 I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: For he is the living God, enduring forever. His kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion has no end.
27Dn 6:27 He delivers and rescues, he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth; for he has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."
27Dn 6:28 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27Dn 7:1 In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream:
27Dn 7:2 I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea,
27Dn 7:3 and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.
27Dn 7:4 The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then, as I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind was given to it.
27Dn 7:5 Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks in its mouth among its teeth and was told, "Arise, devour many bodies!"
27Dn 7:6 After this, as I watched, another appeared, like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back and four heads; and dominion was given to it.
27Dn 7:7 After this I saw in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth and was devouring, breaking in pieces, and stamping what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that preceded it, and it had ten horns.
27Dn 7:8 I was considering the horns, when another horn appeared, a little one coming up among them; to make room for it, three of the earlier horns were plucked up by the roots. There were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.
27Dn 7:9 As I watched, thrones were set in place, and an Ancient One took his throne, his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning fire.
27Dn 7:10 A stream of fire issued and flowed out from his presence. A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him. The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
27Dn 7:11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.
27Dn 7:12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
27Dn 7:13 As I watched in the night visions, I saw one like a human being coming with the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One and was presented before him.
27Dn 7:14 To him was given dominion and glory and kingship, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed.
27Dn 7:15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me.
27Dn 7:16 I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter:
27Dn 7:17 "As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth.
27Dn 7:18 But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever--forever and ever."
27Dn 7:19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet;
27Dn 7:20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn, which came up and to make room for which three of them fell out--the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that seemed greater than the others.
27Dn 7:21 As I looked, this horn made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them,
27Dn 7:22 until the Ancient One came; then judgment was given for the holy ones of the Most High, and the time arrived when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom.
27Dn 7:23 This is what he said: "As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth that shall be different from all the other kingdoms; it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
27Dn 7:24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them. This one shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.
27Dn 7:25 He shall speak words against the Most High, shall wear out the holy ones of the Most High, and shall attempt to change the sacred seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his power for a time, two times, and half a time.
27Dn 7:26 Then the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and totally destroyed.
27Dn 7:27 The kingship and dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them."
27Dn 7:28 Here the account ends. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale; but I kept the matter in my mind.
27Dn 8:1 In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me at first.
27Dn 8:2 In the vision I was looking and saw myself in Susa the capital, in the province of Elam, and I was by the river Ulai.
27Dn 8:3 I looked up and saw a ram standing beside the river. It had two horns. Both horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up second.
27Dn 8:4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. All beasts were powerless to withstand it, and no one could rescue from its power; it did as it pleased and became strong.
27Dn 8:5 As I was watching, a male goat appeared from the west, coming across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground. The goat had a horn between its eyes.
27Dn 8:6 It came toward the ram with the two horns that I had seen standing beside the river, and it ran at it with savage force.
27Dn 8:7 I saw it approaching the ram. It was enraged against it and struck the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram did not have power to withstand it; it threw the ram down to the ground and trampled upon it, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from its power.
27Dn 8:8 Then the male goat grew exceedingly great; but at the height of its power, the great horn was broken, and in its place there came up four prominent horns toward the four winds of heaven.
27Dn 8:9 Out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
27Dn 8:10 It grew as high as the host of heaven. It threw down to the earth some of the host and some of the stars, and trampled on them.
27Dn 8:11 Even against the prince of the host it acted arrogantly; it took the regular burnt offering away from him and overthrew the place of his sanctuary.
27Dn 8:12 Because of wickedness, the host was given over to it together with the regular burnt offering; it cast truth to the ground, and kept prospering in what it did.
27Dn 8:13 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one that spoke, "For how long is this vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled?"
27Dn 8:14 And he answered him, "For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state."
27Dn 8:15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I tried to understand it. Then someone appeared standing before me, having the appearance of a man,
27Dn 8:16 and I heard a human voice by the Ulai, calling, "Gabriel, help this man understand the vision."
27Dn 8:17 So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I became frightened and fell prostrate. But he said to me, "Understand, O mortal, that the vision is for the time of the end."
27Dn 8:18 As he was speaking to me, I fell into a trance, face to the ground; then he touched me and set me on my feet.
27Dn 8:19 He said, "Listen, and I will tell you what will take place later in the period of wrath; for it refers to the appointed time of the end.
27Dn 8:20 As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.
27Dn 8:21 The male goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between its eyes is the first king.
27Dn 8:22 As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.
27Dn 8:23 At the end of their rule, when the transgressions have reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance shall arise, skilled in intrigue.
27Dn 8:24 He shall grow strong in power, shall cause fearful destruction, and shall succeed in what he does. He shall destroy the powerful and the people of the holy ones.
27Dn 8:25 By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall be great. Without warning he shall destroy many and shall even rise up against the Prince of princes. But he shall be broken, and not by human hands.
27Dn 8:26 The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true. As for you, seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now."
27Dn 8:27 So I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I arose and went about the king's business. But I was dismayed by the vision and did not understand it.
27Dn 9:1 In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede, who became king over the realm of the Chaldeans--
27Dn 9:2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, must be fulfilled for the devastation of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.
27Dn 9:3 Then I turned to the Lord God, to seek an answer by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, "Ah, Lord, great and awesome God, keeping covenant and steadfast love with those who love you and keep your commandments,
27Dn 9:5 we have sinned and done wrong, acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and ordinances.
27Dn 9:6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.
27Dn 9:7 "Righteousness is on your side, O Lord, but open shame, as at this day, falls on us, the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you.
27Dn 9:8 Open shame, O LORD, falls on us, our kings, our officials, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.
27Dn 9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him,
27Dn 9:10 and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by following his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
27Dn 9:11 "All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. So the curse and the oath written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against you.
27Dn 9:12 He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers, by bringing upon us a calamity so great that what has been done against Jerusalem has never before been done under the whole heaven.
27Dn 9:13 Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us. We did not entreat the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and reflecting on his fidelity.
27Dn 9:14 So the LORD kept watch over this calamity until he brought it upon us. Indeed, the LORD our God is right in all that he has done; for we have disobeyed his voice.
27Dn 9:15 "And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made your name renowned even to this day--we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
27Dn 9:16 O Lord, in view of all your righteous acts, let your anger and wrath, we pray, turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become a disgrace among all our neighbors.
27Dn 9:17 Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, and for your own sake, Lord, let your face shine upon your desolated sanctuary.
27Dn 9:18 Incline your ear, O my God, and hear. Open your eyes and look at our desolation and the city that bears your name. We do not present our supplication before you on the ground of our righteousness, but on the ground of your great mercies.
27Dn 9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and act and do not delay! For your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people bear your name!"
27Dn 9:20 While I was speaking, and was praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God on behalf of the holy mountain of my God--
27Dn 9:21 while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen before in a vision, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice.
27Dn 9:22 He came and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come out to give you wisdom and understanding.
27Dn 9:23 At the beginning of your supplications a word went out, and I have come to declare it, for you are greatly beloved. So consider the word and understand the vision:
27Dn 9:24 "Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city: to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.
27Dn 9:25 Know therefore and understand: from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with streets and moat, but in a troubled time.
27Dn 9:26 After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.
27Dn 9:27 He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator."
27Dn 10:1 In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. The word was true, and it concerned a great conflict. He understood the word, having received understanding in the vision.
27Dn 10:2 At that time I, Daniel, had been mourning for three weeks.
27Dn 10:3 I had eaten no rich food, no meat or wine had entered my mouth, and I had not anointed myself at all, for the full three weeks.
27Dn 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris),
27Dn 10:5 I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen, with a belt of gold from Uphaz around his waist.
27Dn 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the roar of a multitude.
27Dn 10:7 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; the people who were with me did not see the vision, though a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled and hid themselves.
27Dn 10:8 So I was left alone to see this great vision. My strength left me, and my complexion grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength.
27Dn 10:9 Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a trance, face to the ground.
27Dn 10:10 But then a hand touched me and roused me to my hands and knees.
27Dn 10:11 He said to me, "Daniel, greatly beloved, pay attention to the words that I am going to speak to you. Stand on your feet, for I have now been sent to you." So while he was speaking this word to me, I stood up trembling.
27Dn 10:12 He said to me, "Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.
27Dn 10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me twenty-one days. So Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I left him there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia,
27Dn 10:14 and have come to help you understand what is to happen to your people at the end of days. For there is a further vision for those days."
27Dn 10:15 While he was speaking these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless.
27Dn 10:16 Then one in human form touched my lips, and I opened my mouth to speak, and said to the one who stood before me, "My lord, because of the vision such pains have come upon me that I retain no strength.
27Dn 10:17 How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For I am shaking, no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me."
27Dn 10:18 Again one in human form touched me and strengthened me.
27Dn 10:19 He said, "Do not fear, greatly beloved, you are safe. Be strong and courageous!" When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
27Dn 10:20 Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Now I must return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I am through with him, the prince of Greece will come.
27Dn 10:21 But I am to tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth. There is no one with me who contends against these princes except Michael, your prince.
27Dn 11:1 As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to support and strengthen him.
27Dn 11:2 "Now I will announce the truth to you. Three more kings shall arise in Persia. The fourth shall be far richer than all of them, and when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.
27Dn 11:3 Then a warrior king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and take action as he pleases.
27Dn 11:4 And while still rising in power, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be uprooted and go to others besides these.
27Dn 11:5 "Then the king of the south shall grow strong, but one of his officers shall grow stronger than he and shall rule a realm greater than his own realm.
27Dn 11:6 After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to ratify the agreement. But she shall not retain her power, and his offspring shall not endure. She shall be given up, she and her attendants and her child and the one who supported her. "In those times
27Dn 11:7 a branch from her roots shall rise up in his place. He shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall take action against them and prevail.
27Dn 11:8 Even their gods, with their idols and with their precious vessels of silver and gold, he shall carry off to Egypt as spoils of war. For some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north;
27Dn 11:9 then the latter shall invade the realm of the king of the south, but will return to his own land.
27Dn 11:10 "His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall advance like a flood and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress.
27Dn 11:11 Moved with rage, the king of the south shall go out and do battle against the king of the north, who shall muster a great multitude, which shall, however, be defeated by his enemy.
27Dn 11:12 When the multitude has been carried off, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall overthrow tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
27Dn 11:13 For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, larger than the former, and after some years he shall advance with a great army and abundant supplies.
27Dn 11:14 "In those times many shall rise against the king of the south. The lawless among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail.
27Dn 11:15 Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, not even his picked troops, for there shall be no strength to resist.
27Dn 11:16 But he who comes against him shall take the actions he pleases, and no one shall withstand him. He shall take a position in the beautiful land, and all of it shall be in his power.
27Dn 11:17 He shall set his mind to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of peace and perform them. In order to destroy the kingdom, he shall give him a woman in marriage; but it shall not succeed or be to his advantage.
27Dn 11:18 Afterward he shall turn to the coastlands, and shall capture many. But a commander shall put an end to his insolence; indeed, he shall turn his insolence back upon him.
27Dn 11:19 Then he shall turn back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
27Dn 11:20 "Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an official for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he shall be broken, though not in anger or in battle.
27Dn 11:21 In his place shall arise a contemptible person on whom royal majesty had not been conferred; he shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom through intrigue.
27Dn 11:22 Armies shall be utterly swept away and broken before him, and the prince of the covenant as well.
27Dn 11:23 And after an alliance is made with him, he shall act deceitfully and become strong with a small party.
27Dn 11:24 Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province and do what none of his predecessors had ever done, lavishing plunder, spoil, and wealth on them. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time.
27Dn 11:25 He shall stir up his power and determination against the king of the south with a great army, and the king of the south shall wage war with a much greater and stronger army. But he shall not succeed, for plots shall be devised against him
27Dn 11:26 by those who eat of the royal rations. They shall break him, his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall slain.
27Dn 11:27 The two kings, their minds bent on evil, shall sit at one table and exchange lies. But it shall not succeed, for there remains an end at the time appointed.
27Dn 11:28 He shall return to his land with great wealth, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. He shall work his will, and return to his own land.
27Dn 11:29 "At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south, but this time it shall not be as it was before.
27Dn 11:30 For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall lose heart and withdraw. He shall be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and pay heed to those who forsake the holy covenant.
27Dn 11:31 Forces sent by him shall occupy and profane the temple and fortress. They shall abolish the regular burnt offering and set up the abomination that makes desolate.
27Dn 11:32 He shall seduce with intrigue those who violate the covenant; but the people who are loyal to their God shall stand firm and take action.
27Dn 11:33 The wise among the people shall give understanding to many; for some days, however, they shall fall by sword and flame, and suffer captivity and plunder.
27Dn 11:34 When they fall victim, they shall receive a little help, and many shall join them insincerely.
27Dn 11:35 Some of the wise shall fall, so that they may be refined, purified, and cleansed, until the time of the end, for there is still an interval until the time appointed.
27Dn 11:36 "The king shall act as he pleases. He shall exalt himself and consider himself greater than any god, and shall speak horrendous things against the God of gods. He shall prosper until the period of wrath is completed, for what is determined shall be done.
27Dn 11:37 He shall pay no respect to the gods of his ancestors, or to the one beloved by women; he shall pay no respect to any other god, for he shall consider himself greater than all.
27Dn 11:38 He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these; a god whom his ancestors did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
27Dn 11:39 He shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall make more wealthy, and shall appoint them as rulers over many, and shall distribute the land for a price.
27Dn 11:40 "At the time of the end the king of the south shall attack him. But the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships. He shall advance against countries and pass through like a flood.
27Dn 11:41 He shall come into the beautiful land, and tens of thousands shall fall victim, but Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites shall escape from his power.
27Dn 11:42 He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
27Dn 11:43 He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the riches of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall follow in his train.
27Dn 11:44 But reports from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go out with great fury to bring ruin and complete destruction to many.
27Dn 11:45 He shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with no one to help him.
27Dn 12:1 "At that time Michael, the great prince, the protector of your people, shall arise. There shall be a time of anguish, such as has never occurred since nations first came into existence. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book.
27Dn 12:2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
27Dn 12:3 Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
27Dn 12:4 But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and the book sealed until the time of the end. Many shall be running back and forth, and evil shall increase."
27Dn 12:5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and two others appeared, one standing on this bank of the stream and one on the other.
27Dn 12:6 One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was upstream, "How long shall it be until the end of these wonders?"
27Dn 12:7 The man clothed in linen, who was upstream, raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven. And I heard him swear by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, two times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things would be accomplished.
27Dn 12:8 I heard but could not understand; so I said, "My lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?"
27Dn 12:9 He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end.
27Dn 12:10 Many shall be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked shall continue to act wickedly. None of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.
27Dn 12:11 From the time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that desolates is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days.
27Dn 12:12 Happy are those who persevere and attain the thousand three hundred thirty-five days.
27Dn 12:13 But you, go your way, and rest; you shall rise for your reward at the end of the days."

28Hs 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in the days of King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel.
28Hs 1:2 When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, "Go, take for yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD."
28Hs 1:3 So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
28Hs 1:4 And the LORD said to him, "Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
28Hs 1:5 On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
28Hs 1:6 She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the LORD said to him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them.
28Hs 1:7 But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by horses, or by horsemen."
28Hs 1:8 When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
28Hs 1:9 Then the LORD said, "Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God."
28Hs 1:10 Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, "You are not my people," it shall be said to them, "Children of the living God."
28Hs 1:11 The people of Judah and the people of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head; and they shall take possession of the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
28Hs 2:1 Say to your brother, Ammi, and to your sister, Ruhamah.
28Hs 2:2 Plead with your mother, plead--for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband--that she put away her whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts,
28Hs 2:3 or I will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and turn her into a parched land, and kill her with thirst.
28Hs 2:4 Upon her children also I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom.
28Hs 2:5 For their mother has played the whore; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, "I will go after my lovers; they give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink."
28Hs 2:6 Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns; and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her paths.
28Hs 2:7 She shall pursue her lovers, but not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, "I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now."
28Hs 2:8 She did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished upon her silver and gold that they used for Baal.
28Hs 2:9 Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness.
28Hs 2:10 Now I will uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.
28Hs 2:11 I will put an end to all her mirth, her festivals, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her appointed festivals.
28Hs 2:12 I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, "These are my pay, which my lovers have given me." I will make them a forest, and the wild animals shall devour them.
28Hs 2:13 I will punish her for the festival days of the Baals, when she offered incense to them and decked herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the LORD.
28Hs 2:14 Therefore, I will now allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
28Hs 2:15 From there I will give her her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she shall respond as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.
28Hs 2:16 On that day, says the LORD, you will call me, "My husband," and no longer will you call me, "My Baal."
28Hs 2:17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more.
28Hs 2:18 I will make for you a covenant on that day with the wild animals, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land; and I will make you lie down in safety.
28Hs 2:19 And I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy.
28Hs 2:20 I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know the LORD.
28Hs 2:21 On that day I will answer, says the LORD, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth;
28Hs 2:22 and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel;
28Hs 2:23 and I will sow him for myself in the land. And I will have pity on Lo-ruhamah, and I will say to Lo-ammi, "You are my people"; and he shall say, "You are my God."
28Hs 3:1 The LORD said to me again, "Go, love a woman who has a lover and is an adulteress, just as the LORD loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
28Hs 3:2 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barley and a measure of wine.
28Hs 3:3 And I said to her, "You must remain as mine for many days; you shall not play the whore, you shall not have intercourse with a man, nor I with you."
28Hs 3:4 For the Israelites shall remain many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or teraphim.
28Hs 3:5 Afterward the Israelites shall return and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; they shall come in awe to the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days.
28Hs 4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, O people of Israel; for the LORD has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or loyalty, and no knowledge of God in the land.
28Hs 4:2 Swearing, lying, and murder, and stealing and adultery break out; bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28Hs 4:3 Therefore the land mourns, and all who live in it languish; together with the wild animals and the birds of the air, even the fish of the sea are perishing.
28Hs 4:4 Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest.
28Hs 4:5 You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night, and I will destroy your mother.
28Hs 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
28Hs 4:7 The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; they changed their glory into shame.
28Hs 4:8 They feed on the sin of my people; they are greedy for their iniquity.
28Hs 4:9 And it shall be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways, and repay them for their deeds.
28Hs 4:10 They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall play the whore, but not multiply; because they have forsaken the LORD to devote themselves to
28Hs 4:11 whoredom. Wine and new wine take away the understanding.
28Hs 4:12 My people consult a piece of wood, and their divining rod gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have played the whore, forsaking their God.
28Hs 4:13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and make offerings upon the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
28Hs 4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go aside with whores, and sacrifice with temple prostitutes; thus a people without understanding comes to ruin.
28Hs 4:15 Though you play the whore, O Israel, do not let Judah become guilty. Do not enter into Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, and do not swear, "As the LORD lives."
28Hs 4:16 Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn; can the LORD now feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture?
28Hs 4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols--let him alone.
28Hs 4:18 When their drinking is ended, they indulge in sexual orgies; they love lewdness more than their glory.
28Hs 4:19 A wind has wrapped them in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
28Hs 5:1 Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! For the judgment pertains to you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor,
28Hs 5:2 and a pit dug deep in Shittim; but I will punish all of them.
28Hs 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have played the whore; Israel is defiled.
28Hs 5:4 Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they do not know the LORD.
28Hs 5:5 Israel's pride testifies against him; Ephraim stumbles in his guilt; Judah also stumbles with them.
28Hs 5:6 With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them.
28Hs 5:7 They have dealt faithlessly with the LORD; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon shall devour them along with their fields.
28Hs 5:8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven; look behind you, Benjamin!
28Hs 5:9 Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of punishment; among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure.
28Hs 5:10 The princes of Judah have become like those who remove the landmark; on them I will pour out my wrath like water.
28Hs 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to go after vanity.
28Hs 5:12 Therefore I am like maggots to Ephraim, and like rottenness to the house of Judah.
28Hs 5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound.
28Hs 5:14 For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear and go away; I will carry off, and no one shall rescue.
28Hs 5:15 I will return again to my place until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face. In their distress they will beg my favor:
28Hs 6:1 "Come, let us return to the LORD; for it is he who has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck down, and he will bind us up.
28Hs 6:2 After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him.
28Hs 6:3 Let us know, let us press on to know the LORD; his appearing is as sure as the dawn; he will come to us like the showers, like the spring rains that water the earth."
28Hs 6:4 What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes away early.
28Hs 6:5 Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have killed them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light.
28Hs 6:6 For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
28Hs 6:7 But at Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.
28Hs 6:8 Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood.
28Hs 6:9 As robbers lie in wait for someone, so the priests are banded together; they murder on the road to Shechem, they commit a monstrous crime.
28Hs 6:10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there, Israel is defiled.
28Hs 6:11 For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed. When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
28Hs 7:1 when I would heal Israel, the corruption of Ephraim is revealed, and the wicked deeds of Samaria; for they deal falsely, the thief breaks in, and the bandits raid outside.
28Hs 7:2 But they do not consider that I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds surround them, they are before my face.
28Hs 7:3 By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the officials by their treachery.
28Hs 7:4 They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven, whose baker does not need to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
28Hs 7:5 On the day of our king the officials became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.
28Hs 7:6 For they are kindled like an oven, their heart burns within them; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
28Hs 7:7 All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls upon me.
28Hs 7:8 Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
28Hs 7:9 Foreigners devour his strength, but he does not know it; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, but he does not know it.
28Hs 7:10 Israel's pride testifies against him; yet they do not return to the LORD their God, or seek him, for all this.
28Hs 7:11 Ephraim has become like a dove, silly and without sense; they call upon Egypt, they go to Assyria.
28Hs 7:12 As they go, I will cast my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will discipline them according to the report made to their assembly.
28Hs 7:13 Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.
28Hs 7:14 They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; they gash themselves for grain and wine; they rebel against me.
28Hs 7:15 It was I who trained and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me.
28Hs 7:16 They turn to that which does not profit; they have become like a defective bow; their officials shall fall by the sword because of the rage of their tongue. So much for their babbling in the land of Egypt.
28Hs 8:1 Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have broken my covenant, and transgressed my law.
28Hs 8:2 Israel cries to me, "My God, we--Israel--know you!"
28Hs 8:3 Israel has spurned the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
28Hs 8:4 They made kings, but not through me; they set up princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.
28Hs 8:5 Your calf is rejected, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
28Hs 8:6 For it is from Israel, an artisan made it; it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces.
28Hs 8:7 For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads, it shall yield no meal; if it were to yield, foreigners would devour it.
28Hs 8:8 Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations as a useless vessel.
28Hs 8:9 For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass wandering alone; Ephraim has bargained for lovers.
28Hs 8:10 Though they bargain with the nations, I will now gather them up. They shall soon writhe under the burden of kings and princes.
28Hs 8:11 When Ephraim multiplied altars to expiate sin, they became to him altars for sinning.
28Hs 8:12 Though I write for him the multitude of my instructions, they are regarded as a strange thing.
28Hs 8:13 Though they offer choice sacrifices, though they eat flesh, the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
28Hs 8:14 Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds.
28Hs 9:1 Do not rejoice, O Israel! Do not exult as other nations do; for you have played the whore, departing from your God. You have loved a prostitute's pay on all threshing floors.
28Hs 9:2 Threshing floor and winevat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail them.
28Hs 9:3 They shall not remain in the land of the LORD; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria they shall eat unclean food.
28Hs 9:4 They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the LORD, and their sacrifices shall not please him. Such sacrifices shall be like mourners' bread; all who eat of it shall be defiled; for their bread shall be for their hunger only; it shall not come to the house of the LORD.
28Hs 9:5 What will you do on the day of appointed festival, and on the day of the festival of the LORD?
28Hs 9:6 For even if they escape destruction, Egypt shall gather them, Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.
28Hs 9:7 The days of punishment have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel cries, "The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad!" Because of your great iniquity, your hostility is great.
28Hs 9:8 The prophet is a sentinel for my God over Ephraim, yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, and hostility in the house of his God.
28Hs 9:9 They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; he will remember their iniquity, he will punish their sins.
28Hs 9:10 Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree, in its first season, I saw your ancestors. But they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to a thing of shame, and became detestable like the thing they loved.
28Hs 9:11 Ephraim's glory shall fly away like a bird--no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!
28Hs 9:12 Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them until no one is left. Woe to them indeed when I depart from them!
28Hs 9:13 Once I saw Ephraim as a young palm planted in a lovely meadow, but now Ephraim must lead out his children for slaughter.
28Hs 9:14 Give them, O LORD--what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
28Hs 9:15 Every evil of theirs began at Gilgal; there I came to hate them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their officials are rebels.
28Hs 9:16 Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb.
28Hs 9:17 Because they have not listened to him, my God will reject them; they shall become wanderers among the nations.
28Hs 10:1 Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit. The more his fruit increased the more altars he built; as his country improved, he improved his pillars.
28Hs 10:2 Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars, and destroy their pillars.
28Hs 10:3 For now they will say: "We have no king, for we do not fear the LORD, and a king--what could he do for us?"
28Hs 10:4 They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so litigation springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
28Hs 10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the calf of Beth-aven. Its people shall mourn for it, and its idolatrous priests shall wail over it, over its glory that has departed from it.
28Hs 10:6 The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.
28Hs 10:7 Samaria's king shall perish like a chip on the face of the waters.
28Hs 10:8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars. They shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.
28Hs 10:9 Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; there they have continued. Shall not war overtake them in Gibeah?
28Hs 10:10 I will come against the wayward people to punish them; and nations shall be gathered against them when they are punished for their double iniquity.
28Hs 10:11 Ephraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will make Ephraim break the ground; Judah must plow; Jacob must harrow for himself.
28Hs 10:12 Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap steadfast love; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, that he may come and rain righteousness upon you.
28Hs 10:13 You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your power and in the multitude of your warriors,
28Hs 10:14 therefore the tumult of war shall rise against your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle when mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
28Hs 10:15 Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.
28Hs 11:1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
28Hs 11:2 The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.
28Hs 11:3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them.
28Hs 11:4 I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.
28Hs 11:5 They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.
28Hs 11:6 The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes.
28Hs 11:7 My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all.
28Hs 11:8 How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender.
28Hs 11:9 I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.
28Hs 11:10 They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.
28Hs 11:11 They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD.
28Hs 11:12 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God, and is faithful to the Holy One.
28Hs 12:1 Ephraim herds the wind, and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a treaty with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt.
28Hs 12:2 The LORD has an indictment against Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, and repay him according to his deeds.
28Hs 12:3 In the womb he tried to supplant his brother, and in his manhood he strove with God.
28Hs 12:4 He strove with the angel and prevailed, he wept and sought his favor; he met him at Bethel, and there he spoke with him.
28Hs 12:5 The LORD the God of hosts, the LORD is his name!
28Hs 12:6 But as for you, return to your God, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God.
28Hs 12:7 A trader, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress.
28Hs 12:8 Ephraim has said, "Ah, I am rich, I have gained wealth for myself; in all of my gain no offense has been found in me that would be sin."
28Hs 12:9 I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of the appointed festival.
28Hs 12:10 I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets I will bring destruction.
28Hs 12:11 In Gilead there is iniquity, they shall surely come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, so their altars shall be like stone heaps on the furrows of the field.
28Hs 12:12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram, there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep.
28Hs 12:13 By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.
28Hs 12:14 Ephraim has given bitter offense, so his Lord will bring his crimes down on him and pay him back for his insults.
28Hs 13:1 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel; but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
28Hs 13:2 And now they keep on sinning and make a cast image for themselves, idols of silver made according to their understanding, all of them the work of artisans. "Sacrifice to these," they say. People are kissing calves!
28Hs 13:3 Therefore they shall be like the morning mist or like the dew that goes away early, like chaff that swirls from the threshing floor or like smoke from a window.
28Hs 13:4 Yet I have been the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior.
28Hs 13:5 It was I who fed you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
28Hs 13:6 When I fed them, they were satisfied; they were satisfied, and their heart was proud; therefore they forgot me.
28Hs 13:7 So I will become like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
28Hs 13:8 I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and will tear open the covering of their heart; there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild animal would mangle them.
28Hs 13:9 I will destroy you, O Israel; who can help you?
28Hs 13:10 Where now is your king, that he may save you? Where in all your cities are your rulers, of whom you said, "Give me a king and rulers"?
28Hs 13:11 I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him away in my wrath.
28Hs 13:12 Ephraim's iniquity is bound up; his sin is kept in store.
28Hs 13:13 The pangs of childbirth come for him, but he is an unwise son; for at the proper time he does not present himself at the mouth of the womb.
28Hs 13:14 Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from Death? O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your destruction? Compassion is hidden from my eyes.
28Hs 13:15 Although he may flourish among rushes, the east wind shall come, a blast from the LORD, rising from the wilderness; and his fountain shall dry up, his spring shall be parched. It shall strip his treasury of every precious thing.
28Hs 13:16 Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword, their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.
28Hs 14:1 Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
28Hs 14:2 Take words with you and return to the LORD; say to him, "Take away all guilt; accept that which is good, and we will offer the fruit of our lips.
28Hs 14:3 Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; we will say no more, 'Our God,' to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy."
28Hs 14:4 I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them.
28Hs 14:5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily, he shall strike root like the forests of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:6 His shoots shall spread out; his beauty shall be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like that of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:7 They shall again live beneath my shadow, they shall flourish as a garden; they shall blossom like the vine, their fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:8 O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an evergreen cypress; your faithfulness comes from me.
28Hs 14:9 Those who are wise understand these things; those who are discerning know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them.
29
29Jl 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
29Jl 1:2 Hear this, O elders, give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your ancestors?
29Jl 1:3 Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
29Jl 1:4 What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.
29Jl 1:5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you wine-drinkers, over the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
29Jl 1:6 For a nation has invaded my land, powerful and innumerable; its teeth are lions' teeth, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
29Jl 1:7 It has laid waste my vines, and splintered my fig trees; it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down; their branches have turned white.
29Jl 1:8 Lament like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
29Jl 1:9 The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, the ministers of the LORD.
29Jl 1:10 The fields are devastated, the ground mourns; for the grain is destroyed, the wine dries up, the oil fails.
29Jl 1:11 Be dismayed, you farmers, wail, you vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley; for the crops of the field are ruined.
29Jl 1:12 The vine withers, the fig tree droops. Pomegranate, palm, and apple--all the trees of the field are dried up; surely, joy withers away among the people.
29Jl 1:13 Put on sackcloth and lament, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, pass the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God! Grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
29Jl 1:14 Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
29Jl 1:15 Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
29Jl 1:16 Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29Jl 1:17 The seed shrivels under the clods, the storehouses are desolate; the granaries are ruined because the grain has failed.
29Jl 1:18 How the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander about because there is no pasture for them; even the flocks of sheep are dazed.
29Jl 1:19 To you, O LORD, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have burned all the trees of the field.
29Jl 1:20 Even the wild animals cry to you because the watercourses are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
29Jl 2:1 Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming, it is near--
29Jl 2:2 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness spread upon the mountains a great and powerful army comes; their like has never been from of old, nor will be again after them in ages to come.
29Jl 2:3 Fire devours in front of them, and behind them a flame burns. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, but after them a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them.
29Jl 2:4 They have the appearance of horses, and like war-horses they charge.
29Jl 2:5 As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle.
29Jl 2:6 Before them peoples are in anguish, all faces grow pale.
29Jl 2:7 Like warriors they charge, like soldiers they scale the wall. Each keeps to its own course, they do not swerve from their paths.
29Jl 2:8 They do not jostle one another, each keeps to its own track; they burst through the weapons and are not halted.
29Jl 2:9 They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls; they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief.
29Jl 2:10 The earth quakes before them, the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
29Jl 2:11 The LORD utters his voice at the head of his army; how vast is his host! Numberless are those who obey his command. Truly the day of the LORD is great; terrible indeed--who can endure it?
29Jl 2:12 Yet even now, says the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;
29Jl 2:13 rend your hearts and not your clothing. Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing.
29Jl 2:14 Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering for the LORD, your God?
29Jl 2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly;
29Jl 2:16 gather the people. Sanctify the congregation; assemble the aged; gather the children, even infants at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her canopy.
29Jl 2:17 Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep. Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD, and do not make your heritage a mockery, a byword among the nations. Why should it be said among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"
29Jl 2:18 Then the LORD became jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
29Jl 2:19 In response to his people the LORD said: I am sending you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a mockery among the nations.
29Jl 2:20 I will remove the northern army far from you, and drive it into a parched and desolate land, its front into the eastern sea, and its rear into the western sea; its stench and foul smell will rise up. Surely he has done great things!
29Jl 2:21 Do not fear, O soil; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things!
29Jl 2:22 Do not fear, you animals of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and vine give their full yield.
29Jl 2:23 O children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God; for he has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the later rain, as before.
29Jl 2:24 The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
29Jl 2:25 I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent against you.
29Jl 2:26 You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:27 You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is no other. And my people shall never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:28 Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
29Jl 2:29 Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit.
29Jl 2:30 I will show portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.
29Jl 2:31 The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.
29Jl 2:32 Then everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.
29Jl 3:1 For then, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29Jl 3:2 I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations. They have divided my land,
29Jl 3:3 and cast lots for my people, and traded boys for prostitutes, and sold girls for wine, and drunk it down.
29Jl 3:4 What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads swiftly and speedily.
29Jl 3:5 For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.
29Jl 3:6 You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing them far from their own border.
29Jl 3:7 But now I will rouse them to leave the places to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads.
29Jl 3:8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away; for the LORD has spoken.
29Jl 3:9 Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war, stir up the warriors. Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up.
29Jl 3:10 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weakling say, "I am a warrior."
29Jl 3:11 Come quickly, all you nations all around, gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD.
29Jl 3:12 Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the neighboring nations.
29Jl 3:13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the wine press is full. The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
29Jl 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
29Jl 3:15 The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
29Jl 3:16 The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shake. But the LORD is a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
29Jl 3:17 So you shall know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
29Jl 3:18 In that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water; a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Wadi Shittim.
29Jl 3:19 Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.
29Jl 3:20 But Judah shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem to all generations.
29Jl 3:21 I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty, for the LORD dwells in Zion.

30Am 1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of King Uzziah of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
30Am 1:2 And he said: The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds wither, and the top of Carmel dries up.
30Am 1:3 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron.
30Am 1:4 So I will send a fire on the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.
30Am 1:5 I will break the gate bars of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven, and the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden; and the people of Aram shall go into exile to Kir, says the LORD.
30Am 1:6 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they carried into exile entire communities, to hand them over to Edom.
30Am 1:7 So I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, fire that shall devour its strongholds.
30Am 1:8 I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod, and the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord GOD.
30Am 1:9 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they delivered entire communities over to Edom, and did not remember the covenant of kinship.
30Am 1:10 So I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, fire that shall devour its strongholds.
30Am 1:11 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because he pursued his brother with the sword and cast off all pity; he maintained his anger perpetually, and kept his wrath forever.
30Am 1:12 So I will send a fire on Teman, and it shall devour the strongholds of Bozrah.
30Am 1:13 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory.
30Am 1:14 So I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah, fire that shall devour its strongholds, with shouting on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the whirlwind;
30Am 1:15 then their king shall go into exile, he and his officials together, says the LORD.
30Am 2:1 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.
30Am 2:2 So I will send a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth, and Moab shall die amid uproar, amid shouting and the sound of the trumpet;
30Am 2:3 I will cut off the ruler from its midst, and will kill all its officials with him, says the LORD.
30Am 2:4 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, but they have been led astray by the same lies after which their ancestors walked.
30Am 2:5 So I will send a fire on Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.
30Am 2:6 Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals--
30Am 2:7 they who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and push the afflicted out of the way; father and son go in to the same girl, so that my holy name is profaned;
30Am 2:8 they lay themselves down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink wine bought with fines they imposed.
30Am 2:9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was as strong as oaks; I destroyed his fruit above, and his roots beneath.
30Am 2:10 Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
30Am 2:11 And I raised up some of your children to be prophets and some of your youths to be nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel? says the LORD.
30Am 2:12 But you made the nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, saying, "You shall not prophesy."
30Am 2:13 So, I will press you down in your place, just as a cart presses down when it is full of sheaves.
30Am 2:14 Flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not retain their strength, nor shall the mighty save their lives;
30Am 2:15 those who handle the bow shall not stand, and those who are swift of foot shall not save themselves, nor shall those who ride horses save their lives;
30Am 2:16 and those who are stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the LORD.
30Am 3:1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
30Am 3:2 You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
30Am 3:3 Do two walk together unless they have made an appointment?
30Am 3:4 Does a lion roar in the forest, when it has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from its den, if it has caught nothing?
30Am 3:5 Does a bird fall into a snare on the earth, when there is no trap for it? Does a snare spring up from the ground, when it has taken nothing?
30Am 3:6 Is a trumpet blown in a city, and the people are not afraid? Does disaster befall a city, unless the LORD has done it?
30Am 3:7 Surely the Lord GOD does nothing, without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.
30Am 3:8 The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken; who can but prophesy?
30Am 3:9 Proclaim to the strongholds in Ashdod, and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt, and say, "Assemble yourselves on Mount Samaria, and see what great tumults are within it, and what oppressions are in its midst."
30Am 3:10 They do not know how to do right, says the LORD, those who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds.
30Am 3:11 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: An adversary shall surround the land, and strip you of your defense; and your strongholds shall be plundered.
30Am 3:12 Thus says the LORD: As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who live in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed.
30Am 3:13 Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob, says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts:
30Am 3:14 On the day I punish Israel for its transgressions, I will punish the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground.
30Am 3:15 I will tear down the winter house as well as the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall come to an end, says the LORD.
30Am 4:1 Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who are on Mount Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their husbands, "Bring something to drink!"
30Am 4:2 The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness: The time is surely coming upon you, when they shall take you away with hooks, even the last of you with fishhooks.
30Am 4:3 Through breaches in the wall you shall leave, each one straight ahead; and you shall be flung out into Harmon, says the LORD.
30Am 4:4 Come to Bethel--and transgress; to Gilgal--and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days;
30Am 4:5 bring a thank-offering of leavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel! says the Lord GOD.
30Am 4:6 I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
30Am 4:7 And I also withheld the rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest; I would send rain on one city, and send no rain on another city; one field would be rained upon, and the field on which it did not rain withered;
30Am 4:8 so two or three towns wandered to one town to drink water, and were not satisfied; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
30Am 4:9 I struck you with blight and mildew; I laid waste your gardens and your vineyards; the locust devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
30Am 4:10 I sent among you a pestilence after the manner of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword; I carried away your horses; and I made the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
30Am 4:11 I overthrew some of you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a brand snatched from the fire; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
30Am 4:12 Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!
30Am 4:13 For lo, the one who forms the mountains, creates the wind, reveals his thoughts to mortals, makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth--the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name!
30Am 5:1 Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:
30Am 5:2 Fallen, no more to rise, is maiden Israel; forsaken on her land, with no one to raise her up.
30Am 5:3 For thus says the Lord GOD: The city that marched out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which marched out a hundred shall have ten left.
30Am 5:4 For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel: Seek me and live;
30Am 5:5 but do not seek Bethel, and do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to nothing.
30Am 5:6 Seek the LORD and live, or he will break out against the house of Joseph like fire, and it will devour Bethel, with no one to quench it.
30Am 5:7 Ah, you that turn justice to wormwood, and bring righteousness to the ground!
30Am 5:8 The one who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth, the LORD is his name,
30Am 5:9 who makes destruction flash out against the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
30Am 5:10 They hate the one who reproves in the gate, and they abhor the one who speaks the truth.
30Am 5:11 Therefore because you trample on the poor and take from them levies of grain, you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not live in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine.
30Am 5:12 For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great are your sins--you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and push aside the needy in the gate.
30Am 5:13 Therefore the prudent will keep silent in such a time; for it is an evil time.
30Am 5:14 Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, just as you have said.
30Am 5:15 Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
30Am 5:16 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord: In all the squares there shall be wailing; and in all the streets they shall say, "Alas! alas!" They shall call the farmers to mourning, and those skilled in lamentation, to wailing;
30Am 5:17 in all the vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of you, says the LORD.
30Am 5:18 Alas for you who desire the day of the LORD! Why do you want the day of the LORD? It is darkness, not light;
30Am 5:19 as if someone fled from a lion, and was met by a bear; or went into the house and rested a hand against the wall, and was bitten by a snake.
30Am 5:20 Is not the day of the LORD darkness, not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?
30Am 5:21 I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
30Am 5:22 Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals I will not look upon.
30Am 5:23 Take away from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your harps.
30Am 5:24 But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream.
30Am 5:25 Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
30Am 5:26 You shall take up Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwan your star-god, your images, which you made for yourselves;
30Am 5:27 therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus, says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.
30Am 6:1 Alas for those who are at ease in Zion, and for those who feel secure on Mount Samaria, the notables of the first of the nations, to whom the house of Israel resorts!
30Am 6:2 Cross over to Calneh, and see; from there go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Or is your territory greater than their territory,
30Am 6:3 O you that put far away the evil day, and bring near a reign of violence?
30Am 6:4 Alas for those who lie on beds of ivory, and lounge on their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the stall;
30Am 6:5 who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp, and like David improvise on instruments of music;
30Am 6:6 who drink wine from bowls, and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!
30Am 6:7 Therefore they shall now be the first to go into exile, and the revelry of the loungers shall pass away.
30Am 6:8 The Lord GOD has sworn by himself (says the LORD, the God of hosts): I abhor the pride of Jacob and hate his strongholds; and I will deliver up the city and all that is in it.
30Am 6:9 If ten people remain in one house, they shall die.
30Am 6:10 And if a relative, one who burns the dead, shall take up the body to bring it out of the house, and shall say to someone in the innermost parts of the house, "Is anyone else with you?" the answer will come, "No." Then the relative shall say, "Hush! We must not mention the name of the LORD."
30Am 6:11 See, the LORD commands, and the great house shall be shattered to bits, and the little house to pieces.
30Am 6:12 Do horses run on rocks? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood--
30Am 6:13 you who rejoice in Lo-debar, who say, "Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?"
30Am 6:14 Indeed, I am raising up against you a nation, O house of Israel, says the LORD, the God of hosts, and they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi Arabah.
30Am 7:1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: he was forming locusts at the time the latter growth began to sprout (it was the latter growth after the king's mowings).
30Am 7:2 When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, "O Lord GOD, forgive, I beg you! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"
30Am 7:3 The LORD relented concerning this; "It shall not be," said the LORD.
30Am 7:4 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: the Lord GOD was calling for a shower of fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land.
30Am 7:5 Then I said, "O Lord GOD, cease, I beg you! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"
30Am 7:6 The LORD relented concerning this; "This also shall not be," said the Lord GOD.
30Am 7:7 This is what he showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
30Am 7:8 And the LORD said to me, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "See, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass them by;
30Am 7:9 the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."
30Am 7:10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
30Am 7:11 For thus Amos has said, 'Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.'"
30Am 7:12 And Amaziah said to Amos, "O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there;
30Am 7:13 but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom."
30Am 7:14 Then Amos answered Amaziah, "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees,
30Am 7:15 and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'
30Am 7:16 "Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.'
30Am 7:17 Therefore thus says the LORD: 'Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.'"
30Am 8:1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me--a basket of summer fruit.
30Am 8:2 He said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by.
30Am 8:3 The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day," says the Lord GOD; "the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!"
30Am 8:4 Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,
30Am 8:5 saying, "When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,
30Am 8:6 buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat."
30Am 8:7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
30Am 8:8 Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it, and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?
30Am 8:9 On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.
30Am 8:10 I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.
30Am 8:11 The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land; not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
30Am 8:12 They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.
30Am 8:13 In that day the beautiful young women and the young men shall faint for thirst.
30Am 8:14 Those who swear by Ashimah of Samaria, and say, "As your god lives, O Dan," and, "As the way of Beer-sheba lives"--they shall fall, and never rise again.
30Am 9:1 I saw the LORD standing beside the altar, and he said: Strike the capitals until the thresholds shake, and shatter them on the heads of all the people; and those who are left I will kill with the sword; not one of them shall flee away, not one of them shall escape.
30Am 9:2 Though they dig into Sheol, from there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down.
30Am 9:3 Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will search out and take them; and though they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the sea-serpent, and it shall bite them.
30Am 9:4 And though they go into captivity in front of their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it shall kill them; and I will fix my eyes on them for harm and not for good.
30Am 9:5 The Lord, GOD of hosts, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile, and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;
30Am 9:6 who builds his upper chambers in the heavens, and founds his vault upon the earth; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the surface of the earth--the LORD is his name.
30Am 9:7 Are you not like the Ethiopians to me, O people of Israel? says the LORD. Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
30Am 9:8 The eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth--except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says the LORD.
30Am 9:9 For lo, I will command, and shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one shakes with a sieve, but no pebble shall fall to the ground.
30Am 9:10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, "Evil shall not overtake or meet us."
30Am 9:11 On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old;
30Am 9:12 in order that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name, says the LORD who does this.
30Am 9:13 The time is surely coming, says the LORD, when the one who plows shall overtake the one who reaps, and the treader of grapes the one who sows the seed; the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it.
30Am 9:14 I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.
30Am 9:15 I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be plucked up out of the land that I have given them, says the LORD your God.

31Ob 1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom: We have heard a report from the LORD, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: "Rise up! Let us rise against it for battle!"
31Ob 1:2 I will surely make you least among the nations; you shall be utterly despised.
31Ob 1:3 Your proud heart has deceived you, you that live in the clefts of the rock, whose dwelling is in the heights. You say in your heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?"
31Ob 1:4 Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down, says the LORD.
31Ob 1:5 If thieves came to you, if plunderers by night--how you have been destroyed!--would they not steal only what they wanted? If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?
31Ob 1:6 How Esau has been pillaged, his treasures searched out!
31Ob 1:7 All your allies have deceived you, they have driven you to the border; your confederates have prevailed against you; those who ate your bread have set a trap for you--there is no understanding of it.
31Ob 1:8 On that day, says the LORD, I will destroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of Mount Esau.
31Ob 1:9 Your warriors shall be shattered, O Teman, so that everyone from Mount Esau will be cut off.
31Ob 1:10 For the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever.
31Ob 1:11 On the day that you stood aside, on the day that strangers carried off his wealth, and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you too were like one of them.
31Ob 1:12 But you should not have gloated over your brother on the day of his misfortune; you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah on the day of their ruin; you should not have boasted on the day of distress.
31Ob 1:13 You should not have entered the gate of my people on the day of their calamity; you should not have joined in the gloating over Judah's disaster on the day of his calamity; you should not have looted his goods on the day of his calamity.
31Ob 1:14 You should not have stood at the crossings to cut off his fugitives; you should not have handed over his survivors on the day of distress.
31Ob 1:15 For the day of the LORD is near against all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head.
31Ob 1:16 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations around you shall drink; they shall drink and gulp down, and shall be as though they had never been.
31Ob 1:17 But on Mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall take possession of those who dispossessed them.
31Ob 1:18 The house of Jacob shall be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble; they shall burn them and consume them, and there shall be no survivor of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken.
31Ob 1:19 Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau, and those of the Shephelah the land of the Philistines; they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the land of Samaria, and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
31Ob 1:20 The exiles of the Israelites who are in Halah shall possess Phoenicia as far as Zarephath; and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the towns of the Negeb.
31Ob 1:21 Those who have been saved shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

32Jnh 1:1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying,
32Jnh 1:2 "Go at once to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before me."
32Jnh 1:3 But Jonah set out to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid his fare and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
32Jnh 1:4 But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and such a mighty storm came upon the sea that the ship threatened to break up.
32Jnh 1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold of the ship and had lain down, and was fast asleep.
32Jnh 1:6 The captain came and said to him, "What are you doing sound asleep? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps the god will spare us a thought so that we do not perish."
32Jnh 1:7 The sailors said to one another, "Come, let us cast lots, so that we may know on whose account this calamity has come upon us." So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
32Jnh 1:8 Then they said to him, "Tell us why this calamity has come upon us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?"
32Jnh 1:9 "I am a Hebrew," he replied. "I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
32Jnh 1:10 Then the men were even more afraid, and said to him, "What is this that you have done!" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them so.
32Jnh 1:11 Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?" For the sea was growing more and more tempestuous.
32Jnh 1:12 He said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you; for I know it is because of me that this great storm has come upon you."
32Jnh 1:13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them.
32Jnh 1:14 Then they cried out to the LORD, "Please, O LORD, we pray, do not let us perish on account of this man's life. Do not make us guilty of innocent blood; for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you."
32Jnh 1:15 So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
32Jnh 1:16 Then the men feared the LORD even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
32Jnh 1:17 But the LORD provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
32Jnh 2:1 Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
32Jnh 2:2 saying, "I called to the LORD out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.
32Jnh 2:3 You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.
32Jnh 2:4 Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; how shall I look again upon your holy temple?'
32Jnh 2:5 The waters closed in over me; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped around my head
32Jnh 2:6 at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the Pit, O LORD my God.
32Jnh 2:7 As my life was ebbing away, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.
32Jnh 2:8 Those who worship vain idols forsake their true loyalty.
32Jnh 2:9 But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Deliverance belongs to the LORD!"
32Jnh 2:10 Then the LORD spoke to the fish, and it spewed Jonah out upon the dry land.
32Jnh 3:1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,
32Jnh 3:2 "Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you."
32Jnh 3:3 So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days' walk across.
32Jnh 3:4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's walk. And he cried out, "Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
32Jnh 3:5 And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.
32Jnh 3:6 When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
32Jnh 3:7 Then he had a proclamation made in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not feed, nor shall they drink water.
32Jnh 3:8 Human beings and animals shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry mightily to God. All shall turn from their evil ways and from the violence that is in their hands.
32Jnh 3:9 Who knows? God may relent and change his mind; he may turn from his fierce anger, so that we do not perish."
32Jnh 3:10 When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.
32Jnh 4:1 But this was very displeasing to Jonah, and he became angry.
32Jnh 4:2 He prayed to the LORD and said, "O LORD! Is not this what I said while I was still in my own country? That is why I fled to Tarshish at the beginning; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and ready to relent from punishing.
32Jnh 4:3 And now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:4 And the LORD said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
32Jnh 4:5 Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would become of the city.
32Jnh 4:6 The LORD God appointed a bush, and made it come up over Jonah, to give shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort; so Jonah was very happy about the bush.
32Jnh 4:7 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the bush, so that it withered.
32Jnh 4:8 When the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint and asked that he might die. He said, "It is better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:9 But God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the bush?" And he said, "Yes, angry enough to die."
32Jnh 4:10 Then the LORD said, "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.
32Jnh 4:11 And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?"

33Mc 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:2 Hear, you peoples, all of you; listen, O earth, and all that is in it; and let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
33Mc 1:3 For lo, the LORD is coming out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
33Mc 1:4 Then the mountains will melt under him and the valleys will burst open, like wax near the fire, like waters poured down a steep place.
33Mc 1:5 All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
33Mc 1:6 Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour down her stones into the valley, and uncover her foundations.
33Mc 1:7 All her images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste; for as the wages of a prostitute she gathered them, and as the wages of a prostitute they shall again be used.
33Mc 1:8 For this I will lament and wail; I will go barefoot and naked; I will make lamentation like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches.
33Mc 1:9 For her wound is incurable. It has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:10 Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all; in Beth-leaphrah roll yourselves in the dust.
33Mc 1:11 Pass on your way, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come forth; Beth-ezel is wailing and shall remove its support from you.
33Mc 1:12 For the inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good, yet disaster has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:13 Harness the steeds to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish; it was the beginning of sin to daughter Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.
33Mc 1:14 Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib shall be a deception to the kings of Israel.
33Mc 1:15 I will again bring a conqueror upon you, inhabitants of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam.
33Mc 1:16 Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair for your pampered children; make yourselves as bald as the eagle, for they have gone from you into exile.
33Mc 2:1 Alas for those who devise wickedness and evil deeds on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in their power.
33Mc 2:2 They covet fields, and seize them; houses, and take them away; they oppress householder and house, people and their inheritance.
33Mc 2:3 Therefore thus says the LORD: Now, I am devising against this family an evil from which you cannot remove your necks; and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be an evil time.
33Mc 2:4 On that day they shall take up a taunt song against you, and wail with bitter lamentation, and say, "We are utterly ruined; the LORD alters the inheritance of my people; how he removes it from me! Among our captors he parcels out our fields."
33Mc 2:5 Therefore you will have no one to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
33Mc 2:6 "Do not preach"--thus they preach--"one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us."
33Mc 2:7 Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Is the LORD's patience exhausted? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to one who walks uprightly?
33Mc 2:8 But you rise up against my people as an enemy; you strip the robe from the peaceful, from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war.
33Mc 2:9 The women of my people you drive out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my glory forever.
33Mc 2:10 Arise and go; for this is no place to rest, because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction.
33Mc 2:11 If someone were to go about uttering empty falsehoods, saying, "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink," such a one would be the preacher for this people!
33Mc 2:12 I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob, I will gather the survivors of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture; it will resound with people.
33Mc 2:13 The one who breaks out will go up before them; they will break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king will pass on before them, the LORD at their head.
33Mc 3:1 And I said: Listen, you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel! Should you not know justice?--
33Mc 3:2 you who hate the good and love the evil, who tear the skin off my people, and the flesh off their bones;
33Mc 3:3 who eat the flesh of my people, flay their skin off them, break their bones in pieces, and chop them up like meat in a kettle, like flesh in a caldron.
33Mc 3:4 Then they will cry to the LORD, but he will not answer them; he will hide his face from them at that time, because they have acted wickedly.
33Mc 3:5 Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry "Peace" when they have something to eat, but declare war against those who put nothing into their mouths.
33Mc 3:6 Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without revelation. The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them;
33Mc 3:7 the seers shall be disgraced, and the diviners put to shame; they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God.
33Mc 3:8 But as for me, I am filled with power, with the spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
33Mc 3:9 Hear this, you rulers of the house of Jacob and chiefs of the house of Israel, who abhor justice and pervert all equity,
33Mc 3:10 who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with wrong!
33Mc 3:11 Its rulers give judgment for a bribe, its priests teach for a price, its prophets give oracles for money; yet they lean upon the LORD and say, "Surely the LORD is with us! No harm shall come upon us."
33Mc 3:12 Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.
33Mc 4:1 In days to come the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised up above the hills. Peoples shall stream to it,
33Mc 4:2 and many nations shall come and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:3 He shall judge between many peoples, and shall arbitrate between strong nations far away; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more;
33Mc 4:4 but they shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.
33Mc 4:5 For all the peoples walk, each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
33Mc 4:6 In that day, says the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away, and those whom I have afflicted.
33Mc 4:7 The lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion now and forevermore.
33Mc 4:8 And you, O tower of the flock, hill of daughter Zion, to you it shall come, the former dominion shall come, the sovereignty of daughter Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:9 Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pangs have seized you like a woman in labor?
33Mc 4:10 Writhe and groan, O daughter Zion, like a woman in labor; for now you shall go forth from the city and camp in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued, there the LORD will redeem you from the hands of your enemies.
33Mc 4:11 Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, "Let her be profaned, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion."
33Mc 4:12 But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.
33Mc 4:13 Arise and thresh, O daughter Zion, for I will make your horn iron and your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples, and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
33Mc 5:1 Now you are walled around with a wall; siege is laid against us; with a rod they strike the ruler of Israel upon the cheek.
33Mc 5:2 But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.
33Mc 5:3 Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.
33Mc 5:4 And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall live secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth;
33Mc 5:5 and he shall be the one of peace. If the Assyrians come into our land and tread upon our soil, we will raise against them seven shepherds and eight installed as rulers.
33Mc 5:6 They shall rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with the drawn sword; they shall rescue us from the Assyrians if they come into our land or tread within our border.
33Mc 5:7 Then the remnant of Jacob, surrounded by many peoples, shall be like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not depend upon people or wait for any mortal.
33Mc 5:8 And among the nations the remnant of Jacob, surrounded by many peoples, shall be like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, which, when it goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, with no one to deliver.
33Mc 5:9 Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries, and all your enemies shall be cut off.
33Mc 5:10 In that day, says the LORD, I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots;
33Mc 5:11 and I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds;
33Mc 5:12 and I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more soothsayers;
33Mc 5:13 and I will cut off your images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands;
33Mc 5:14 and I will uproot your sacred poles from among you and destroy your towns.
33Mc 5:15 And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance on the nations that did not obey.
33Mc 6:1 Hear what the LORD says: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
33Mc 6:2 Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
33Mc 6:3 "O my people, what have I done to you? In what have I wearied you? Answer me!
33Mc 6:4 For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
33Mc 6:5 O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD."
33Mc 6:6 "With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
33Mc 6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
33Mc 6:8 He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
33Mc 6:9 The voice of the LORD cries to the city (it is sound wisdom to fear your name): Hear, O tribe and assembly of the city!
33Mc 6:10 Can I forget the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed?
33Mc 6:11 Can I tolerate wicked scales and a bag of dishonest weights?
33Mc 6:12 Your wealthy are full of violence; your inhabitants speak lies, with tongues of deceit in their mouths.
33Mc 6:13 Therefore I have begun to strike you down, making you desolate because of your sins.
33Mc 6:14 You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and there shall be a gnawing hunger within you; you shall put away, but not save, and what you save, I will hand over to the sword.
33Mc 6:15 You shall sow, but not reap; you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil; you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.
33Mc 6:16 For you have kept the statutes of Omri and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you have followed their counsels. Therefore I will make you a desolation, and your inhabitants an object of hissing; so you shall bear the scorn of my people.
33Mc 7:1 Woe is me! For I have become like one who, after the summer fruit has been gathered, after the vintage has been gleaned, finds no cluster to eat; there is no first-ripe fig for which I hunger.
33Mc 7:2 The faithful have disappeared from the land, and there is no one left who is upright; they all lie in wait for blood, and they hunt each other with nets.
33Mc 7:3 Their hands are skilled to do evil; the official and the judge ask for a bribe, and the powerful dictate what they desire; thus they pervert justice.
33Mc 7:4 The best of them is like a brier, the most upright of them a thorn hedge. The day of their sentinels, of their punishment, has come; now their confusion is at hand.
33Mc 7:5 Put no trust in a friend, have no confidence in a loved one; guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your embrace;
33Mc 7:6 for the son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; your enemies are members of your own household.
33Mc 7:7 But as for me, I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.
33Mc 7:8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.
33Mc 7:9 I must bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he takes my side and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall see his vindication.
33Mc 7:10 Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her downfall; now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.
33Mc 7:11 A day for the building of your walls! In that day the boundary shall be far extended.
33Mc 7:12 In that day they will come to you from Assyria to Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
33Mc 7:13 But the earth will be desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their doings.
33Mc 7:14 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock that belongs to you, which lives alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.
33Mc 7:15 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, show us marvelous things.
33Mc 7:16 The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf;
33Mc 7:17 they shall lick dust like a snake, like the crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their fortresses; they shall turn in dread to the LORD our God, and they shall stand in fear of you.
33Mc 7:18 Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of your possession? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in showing clemency.
33Mc 7:19 He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
33Mc 7:20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob and unswerving loyalty to Abraham, as you have sworn to our ancestors from the days of old.

34Nah 1:1 An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
34Nah 1:2 A jealous and avenging God is the LORD, the LORD is avenging and wrathful; the LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries and rages against his enemies.
34Nah 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger but great in power, and the LORD will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
34Nah 1:4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither, and the bloom of Lebanon fades.
34Nah 1:5 The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who live in it.
34Nah 1:6 Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and by him the rocks are broken in pieces.
34Nah 1:7 The LORD is good, a stronghold in a day of trouble; he protects those who take refuge in him,
34Nah 1:8 even in a rushing flood. He will make a full end of his adversaries, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
34Nah 1:9 Why do you plot against the LORD? He will make an end; no adversary will rise up twice.
34Nah 1:10 Like thorns they are entangled, like drunkards they are drunk; they are consumed like dry straw.
34Nah 1:11 From you one has gone out who plots evil against the LORD, who counsels wickedness.
34Nah 1:12 Thus says the LORD, "Though they are at full strength and many, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
34Nah 1:13 And now I will break off his yoke from you and snap the bonds that bind you."
34Nah 1:14 The LORD has commanded concerning you: "Your name shall be perpetuated no longer; from the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the cast image. I will make your grave, for you are worthless."
34Nah 1:15 Look! On the mountains the feet of one who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, fulfill your vows, for never again shall the wicked invade you; they are utterly cut off.
34Nah 2:1 A shatterer has come up against you. Guard the ramparts; watch the road; gird your loins; collect all your strength.
34Nah 2:2 (For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob, as well as the majesty of Israel, though ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their branches.)
34Nah 2:3 The shields of his warriors are red; his soldiers are clothed in crimson. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day when he musters them; the chargers prance.
34Nah 2:4 The chariots race madly through the streets, they rush to and fro through the squares; their appearance is like torches, they dart like lightning.
34Nah 2:5 He calls his officers; they stumble as they come forward; they hasten to the wall, and the mantelet is set up.
34Nah 2:6 The river gates are opened, the palace trembles.
34Nah 2:7 It is decreed that the city be exiled, its slave women led away, moaning like doves and beating their breasts.
34Nah 2:8 Nineveh is like a pool whose waters run away. "Halt! Halt!"--but no one turns back.
34Nah 2:9 "Plunder the silver, plunder the gold! There is no end of treasure! An abundance of every precious thing!"
34Nah 2:10 Devastation, desolation, and destruction! Hearts faint and knees tremble, all loins quake, all faces grow pale!
34Nah 2:11 What became of the lions' den, the cave of the young lions, where the lion goes, and the lion's cubs, with no one to disturb them?
34Nah 2:12 The lion has torn enough for his whelps and strangled prey for his lionesses; he has filled his caves with prey and his dens with torn flesh.
34Nah 2:13 See, I am against you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall be heard no more.
34Nah 3:1 Ah! City of bloodshed, utterly deceitful, full of booty--no end to the plunder!
34Nah 3:2 The crack of whip and rumble of wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!
34Nah 3:3 Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, piles of dead, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end--they stumble over the bodies!
34Nah 3:4 Because of the countless debaucheries of the prostitute, gracefully alluring, mistress of sorcery, who enslaves nations through her debaucheries, and peoples through her sorcery,
34Nah 3:5 I am against you, says the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will let nations look on your nakedness and kingdoms on your shame.
34Nah 3:6 I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt, and make you a spectacle.
34Nah 3:7 Then all who see you will shrink from you and say, "Nineveh is devastated; who will bemoan her?" Where shall I seek comforters for you?
34Nah 3:8 Are you better than Thebes that sat by the Nile, with water around her, her rampart a sea, water her wall?
34Nah 3:9 Ethiopia was her strength, Egypt too, and that without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers.
34Nah 3:10 Yet she became an exile, she went into captivity; even her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; lots were cast for her nobles, all her dignitaries were bound in fetters.
34Nah 3:11 You also will be drunken, you will go into hiding; you will seek a refuge from the enemy.
34Nah 3:12 All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs--if shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.
34Nah 3:13 Look at your troops: they are women in your midst. The gates of your land are wide open to your foes; fire has devoured the bars of your gates.
34Nah 3:14 Draw water for the siege, strengthen your forts; trample the clay, tread the mortar, take hold of the brick mold!
34Nah 3:15 There the fire will devour you, the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust, multiply like the grasshopper!
34Nah 3:16 You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust sheds its skin and flies away.
34Nah 3:17 Your guards are like grasshoppers, your scribes like swarms of locusts settling on the fences on a cold day--when the sun rises, they fly away; no one knows where they have gone.
34Nah 3:18 Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.
34Nah 3:19 There is no assuaging your hurt, your wound is mortal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For who has ever escaped your endless cruelty?
35
35Hab 1:1 The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw.
35Hab 1:2 O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Or cry to you "Violence!" and you will not save?
35Hab 1:3 Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.
35Hab 1:4 So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails. The wicked surround the righteous--therefore judgment comes forth perverted.
35Hab 1:5 Look at the nations, and see! Be astonished! Be astounded! For a work is being done in your days that you would not believe if you were told.
35Hab 1:6 For I am rousing the Chaldeans, that fierce and impetuous nation, who march through the breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own.
35Hab 1:7 Dread and fearsome are they; their justice and dignity proceed from themselves.
35Hab 1:8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, more menacing than wolves at dusk; their horses charge. Their horsemen come from far away; they fly like an eagle swift to devour.
35Hab 1:9 They all come for violence, with faces pressing forward; they gather captives like sand.
35Hab 1:10 At kings they scoff, and of rulers they make sport. They laugh at every fortress, and heap up earth to take it.
35Hab 1:11 Then they sweep by like the wind; they transgress and become guilty; their own might is their god!
35Hab 1:12 Are you not from of old, O LORD my God, my Holy One? You shall not die. O LORD, you have marked them for judgment; and you, O Rock, have established them for punishment.
35Hab 1:13 Your eyes are too pure to behold evil, and you cannot look on wrongdoing; why do you look on the treacherous, and are silent when the wicked swallow those more righteous than they?
35Hab 1:14 You have made people like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler.
35Hab 1:15 The enemy brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net, he gathers them in his seine; so he rejoices and exults.
35Hab 1:16 Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his seine; for by them his portion is lavish, and his food is rich.
35Hab 1:17 Is he then to keep on emptying his net, and destroying nations without mercy?
35Hab 2:1 I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart; I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.
35Hab 2:2 Then the LORD answered me and said: Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.
35Hab 2:3 For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie. If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.
35Hab 2:4 Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.
35Hab 2:5 Moreover, wealth is treacherous; the arrogant do not endure. They open their throats wide as Sheol; like Death they never have enough. They gather all nations for themselves, and collect all peoples as their own.
35Hab 2:6 Shall not everyone taunt such people and, with mocking riddles, say about them, "Alas for you who heap up what is not your own!" How long will you load yourselves with goods taken in pledge?
35Hab 2:7 Will not your own creditors suddenly rise, and those who make you tremble wake up? Then you will be booty for them.
35Hab 2:8 Because you have plundered many nations, all that survive of the peoples shall plunder you--because of human bloodshed, and violence to the earth, to cities and all who live in them.
35Hab 2:9 "Alas for you who get evil gain for your houses, setting your nest on high to be safe from the reach of harm!"
35Hab 2:10 You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life.
35Hab 2:11 The very stones will cry out from the wall, and the plaster will respond from the woodwork.
35Hab 2:12 "Alas for you who build a town by bloodshed, and found a city on iniquity!"
35Hab 2:13 Is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor only to feed the flames, and nations weary themselves for nothing?
35Hab 2:14 But the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
35Hab 2:15 "Alas for you who make your neighbors drink, pouring out your wrath until they are drunk, in order to gaze on their nakedness!"
35Hab 2:16 You will be sated with contempt instead of glory. Drink, you yourself, and stagger! The cup in the LORD's right hand will come around to you, and shame will come upon your glory!
35Hab 2:17 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you; the destruction of the animals will terrify you-- because of human bloodshed and violence to the earth, to cities and all who live in them.
35Hab 2:18 What use is an idol once its maker has shaped it--a cast image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in what has been made, though the product is only an idol that cannot speak!
35Hab 2:19 Alas for you who say to the wood, "Wake up!" to silent stone, "Rouse yourself!" Can it teach? See, it is gold and silver plated, and there is no breath in it at all.
35Hab 2:20 But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him!
35Hab 3:1 A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk according to Shigionoth.
35Hab 3:2 O LORD, I have heard of your renown, and I stand in awe, O LORD, of your work. In our own time revive it; in our own time make it known; in wrath may you remember mercy.
35Hab 3:3 God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
35Hab 3:4 The brightness was like the sun; rays came forth from his hand, where his power lay hidden.
35Hab 3:5 Before him went pestilence, and plague followed close behind.
35Hab 3:6 He stopped and shook the earth; he looked and made the nations tremble. The eternal mountains were shattered; along his ancient pathways the everlasting hills sank low.
35Hab 3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction; the tent-curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
35Hab 3:8 Was your wrath against the rivers, O LORD? Or your anger against the rivers, or your rage against the sea, when you drove your horses, your chariots to victory?
35Hab 3:9 You brandished your naked bow, sated were the arrows at your command. Selah You split the earth with rivers.
35Hab 3:10 The mountains saw you, and writhed; a torrent of water swept by; the deep gave forth its voice. The sun raised high its hands;
35Hab 3:11 the moon stood still in its exalted place, at the light of your arrows speeding by, at the gleam of your flashing spear.
35Hab 3:12 In fury you trod the earth, in anger you trampled nations.
35Hab 3:13 You came forth to save your people, to save your anointed. You crushed the head of the wicked house, laying it bare from foundation to roof. Selah
35Hab 3:14 You pierced with his own arrows the head of his warriors, who came like a whirlwind to scatter us, gloating as if ready to devour the poor who were in hiding.
35Hab 3:15 You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the mighty waters.
35Hab 3:16 I hear, and I tremble within; my lips quiver at the sound. Rottenness enters into my bones, and my steps tremble beneath me. I wait quietly for the day of calamity to come upon the people who attack us.
35Hab 3:17 Though the fig tree does not blossom, and no fruit is on the vines; though the produce of the olive fails and the fields yield no food; though the flock is cut off from the fold and there is no herd in the stalls,
35Hab 3:18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will exult in the God of my salvation.
35Hab 3:19 GOD, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, and makes me tread upon the heights. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments.

36Zph 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah.
36Zph 1:2 I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth, says the LORD.
36Zph 1:3 I will sweep away humans and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. I will make the wicked stumble. I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth, says the LORD.
36Zph 1:4 I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal and the name of the idolatrous priests;
36Zph 1:5 those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens; those who bow down and swear to the LORD, but also swear by Milcom;
36Zph 1:6 those who have turned back from following the LORD, who have not sought the LORD or inquired of him.
36Zph 1:7 Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is at hand; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has consecrated his guests.
36Zph 1:8 And on the day of the LORD's sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all who dress themselves in foreign attire.
36Zph 1:9 On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and fraud.
36Zph 1:10 On that day, says the LORD, a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, a loud crash from the hills.
36Zph 1:11 The inhabitants of the Mortar wail, for all the traders have perished; all who weigh out silver are cut off.
36Zph 1:12 At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the people who rest complacently on their dregs, those who say in their hearts, "The LORD will not do good, nor will he do harm."
36Zph 1:13 Their wealth shall be plundered, and their houses laid waste. Though they build houses, they shall not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they shall not drink wine from them.
36Zph 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, near and hastening fast; the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter, the warrior cries aloud there.
36Zph 1:15 That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
36Zph 1:16 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the lofty battlements.
36Zph 1:17 I will bring such distress upon people that they shall walk like the blind; because they have sinned against the LORD, their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
36Zph 1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath; in the fire of his passion the whole earth shall be consumed; for a full, a terrible end he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.
36Zph 2:1 Gather together, gather, O shameless nation,
36Zph 2:2 before you are driven away like the drifting chaff, before there comes upon you the fierce anger of the LORD, before there comes upon you the day of the LORD's wrath.
36Zph 2:3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his commands; seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the LORD's wrath.
36Zph 2:4 For Gaza shall be deserted, and Ashkelon shall become a desolation; Ashdod's people shall be driven out at noon, and Ekron shall be uprooted.
36Zph 2:5 Ah, inhabitants of the seacoast, you nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.
36Zph 2:6 And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures, meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.
36Zph 2:7 The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah, on which they shall pasture, and in the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the LORD their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes.
36Zph 2:8 I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory.
36Zph 2:9 Therefore, as I live, says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a land possessed by nettles and salt pits, and a waste forever. The remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the survivors of my nation shall possess them.
36Zph 2:10 This shall be their lot in return for their pride, because they scoffed and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.
36Zph 2:11 The LORD will be terrible against them; he will shrivel all the gods of the earth, and to him shall bow down, each in its place, all the coasts and islands of the nations.
36Zph 2:12 You also, O Ethiopians, shall be killed by my sword.
36Zph 2:13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and he will make Nineveh a desolation, a dry waste like the desert.
36Zph 2:14 Herds shall lie down in it, every wild animal; the desert owl and the screech owl shall lodge on its capitals; the owl shall hoot at the window, the raven croak on the threshold; for its cedar work will be laid bare.
36Zph 2:15 Is this the exultant city that lived secure, that said to itself, "I am, and there is no one else"? What a desolation it has become, a lair for wild animals! Everyone who passes by it hisses and shakes the fist.
36Zph 3:1 Ah, soiled, defiled, oppressing city!
36Zph 3:2 It has listened to no voice; it has accepted no correction. It has not trusted in the LORD; it has not drawn near to its God.
36Zph 3:3 The officials within it are roaring lions; its judges are evening wolves that leave nothing until the morning.
36Zph 3:4 Its prophets are reckless, faithless persons; its priests have profaned what is sacred, they have done violence to the law.
36Zph 3:5 The LORD within it is righteous; he does no wrong. Every morning he renders his judgment, each dawn without fail; but the unjust knows no shame.
36Zph 3:6 I have cut off nations; their battlements are in ruins; I have laid waste their streets so that no one walks in them; their cities have been made desolate, without people, without inhabitants.
36Zph 3:7 I said, "Surely the city will fear me, it will accept correction; it will not lose sight of all that I have brought upon it." But they were the more eager to make all their deeds corrupt.
36Zph 3:8 Therefore wait for me, says the LORD, for the day when I arise as a witness. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all the heat of my anger; for in the fire of my passion all the earth shall be consumed.
36Zph 3:9 At that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord.
36Zph 3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, my scattered ones, shall bring my offering.
36Zph 3:11 On that day you shall not be put to shame because of all the deeds by which you have rebelled against me; for then I will remove from your midst your proudly exultant ones, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain.
36Zph 3:12 For I will leave in the midst of you a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD--
36Zph 3:13 the remnant of Israel; they shall do no wrong and utter no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. Then they will pasture and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.
36Zph 3:14 Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!
36Zph 3:15 The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies. The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more.
36Zph 3:16 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.
36Zph 3:17 The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing
36Zph 3:18 as on a day of festival. I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.
36Zph 3:19 I will deal with all your oppressors at that time. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.
36Zph 3:20 At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you; for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.

37Hg 1:1 In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:
37Hg 1:2 Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the LORD's house.
37Hg 1:3 Then the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying:
37Hg 1:4 Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?
37Hg 1:5 Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider how you have fared.
37Hg 1:6 You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and you that earn wages earn wages to put them into a bag with holes.
37Hg 1:7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider how you have fared.
37Hg 1:8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored, says the LORD.
37Hg 1:9 You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the LORD of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses.
37Hg 1:10 Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
37Hg 1:11 And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors.
37Hg 1:12 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of the prophet Haggai, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people feared the LORD.
37Hg 1:13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, saying, I am with you, says the LORD.
37Hg 1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
37Hg 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month.
37Hg 2:1 In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying:
37Hg 2:2 Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say,
37Hg 2:3 Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?
37Hg 2:4 Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts,
37Hg 2:5 according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.
37Hg 2:6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;
37Hg 2:7 and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts.
37Hg 2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts.
37Hg 2:9 The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.
37Hg 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying:
37Hg 2:11 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Ask the priests for a ruling:
37Hg 2:12 If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of one's garment, and with the fold touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy? The priests answered, "No."
37Hg 2:13 Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?" The priests answered, "Yes, it becomes unclean."
37Hg 2:14 Haggai then said, So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, says the LORD; and so with every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
37Hg 2:15 But now, consider what will come to pass from this day on. Before a stone was placed upon a stone in the LORD's temple,
37Hg 2:16 how did you fare? When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.
37Hg 2:17 I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and mildew and hail; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
37Hg 2:18 Consider from this day on, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider:
37Hg 2:19 Is there any seed left in the barn? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still yield nothing? From this day on I will bless you.
37Hg 2:20 The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
37Hg 2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
37Hg 2:22 and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders; and the horses and their riders shall fall, every one by the sword of a comrade.
37Hg 2:23 On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, son of Shealtiel, says the LORD, and make you like a signet ring; for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts.

38Zch 1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo, saying:
38Zch 1:2 The LORD was very angry with your ancestors.
38Zch 1:3 Therefore say to them, Thus says the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 1:4 Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds." But they did not hear or heed me, says the LORD.
38Zch 1:5 Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
38Zch 1:6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your ancestors? So they repented and said, "The LORD of hosts has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds, just as he planned to do."
38Zch 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo; and Zechariah said,
38Zch 1:8 In the night I saw a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
38Zch 1:9 Then I said, "What are these, my lord?" The angel who talked with me said to me, "I will show you what they are."
38Zch 1:10 So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, "They are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."
38Zch 1:11 Then they spoke to the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, "We have patrolled the earth, and lo, the whole earth remains at peace."
38Zch 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry these seventy years?"
38Zch 1:13 Then the LORD replied with gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
38Zch 1:14 So the angel who talked with me said to me, Proclaim this message: Thus says the LORD of hosts; I am very jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
38Zch 1:15 And I am extremely angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they made the disaster worse.
38Zch 1:16 Therefore, thus says the LORD, I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; my house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
38Zch 1:17 Proclaim further: Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.
38Zch 1:18 And I looked up and saw four horns.
38Zch 1:19 I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four blacksmiths.
38Zch 1:21 And I asked, "What are they coming to do?" He answered, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no head could be raised; but these have come to terrify them, to strike down the horns of the nations that lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people."
38Zch 2:1 I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38Zch 2:2 Then I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length."
38Zch 2:3 Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him,
38Zch 2:4 and said to him, "Run, say to that young man: Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and animals in it.
38Zch 2:5 For I will be a wall of fire all around it, says the LORD, and I will be the glory within it."
38Zch 2:6 Up, up! Flee from the land of the north, says the LORD; for I have spread you abroad like the four winds of heaven, says the LORD.
38Zch 2:7 Up! Escape to Zion, you that live with daughter Babylon.
38Zch 2:8 For thus said the LORD of hosts (after his glory sent me) regarding the nations that plundered you: Truly, one who touches you touches the apple of my eye.
38Zch 2:9 See now, I am going to raise my hand against them, and they shall become plunder for their own slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
38Zch 2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! For lo, I will come and dwell in your midst, says the LORD.
38Zch 2:11 Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in your midst. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38Zch 2:12 The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
38Zch 2:13 Be silent, all people, before the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
38Zch 3:1 Then he showed me the high priest Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
38Zch 3:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked from the fire?"
38Zch 3:3 Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
38Zch 3:4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, "Take off his filthy clothes." And to him he said, "See, I have taken your guilt away from you, and I will clothe you with festal apparel."
38Zch 3:5 And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with the apparel; and the angel of the LORD was standing by.
38Zch 3:6 Then the angel of the LORD assured Joshua, saying
38Zch 3:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here.
38Zch 3:8 Now listen, Joshua, high priest, you and your colleagues who sit before you! For they are an omen of things to come: I am going to bring my servant the Branch.
38Zch 3:9 For on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven facets, I will engrave its inscription, says the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the guilt of this land in a single day.
38Zch 3:10 On that day, says the LORD of hosts, you shall invite each other to come under your vine and fig tree."
38Zch 4:1 The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as one is wakened from sleep.
38Zch 4:2 He said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it; there are seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
38Zch 4:3 And by it there are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left."
38Zch 4:4 I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 4:5 Then the angel who talked with me answered me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord."
38Zch 4:6 He said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 4:7 What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring out the top stone amid shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!'"
38Zch 4:8 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
38Zch 4:9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38Zch 4:10 For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. "These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth."
38Zch 4:11 Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?"
38Zch 4:12 And a second time I said to him, "What are these two branches of the olive trees, which pour out the oil through the two golden pipes?"
38Zch 4:13 He said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord."
38Zch 4:14 Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38Zch 5:1 Again I looked up and saw a flying scroll.
38Zch 5:2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits."
38Zch 5:3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to the writing on the other side.
38Zch 5:4 I have sent it out, says the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name; and it shall abide in that house and consume it, both timber and stones."
38Zch 5:5 Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, "Look up and see what this is that is coming out."
38Zch 5:6 I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is a basket coming out." And he said, "This is their iniquity in all the land."
38Zch 5:7 Then a leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket!
38Zch 5:8 And he said, "This is Wickedness." So he thrust her back into the basket, and pressed the leaden weight down on its mouth.
38Zch 5:9 Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward. The wind was in their wings; they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and sky.
38Zch 5:10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"
38Zch 5:11 He said to me, "To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it; and when this is prepared, they will set the basket down there on its base."
38Zch 6:1 And again I looked up and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains--mountains of bronze.
38Zch 6:2 The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot black horses,
38Zch 6:3 the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled gray horses.
38Zch 6:4 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 6:5 The angel answered me, "These are the four winds of heaven going out, after presenting themselves before the LORD of all the earth.
38Zch 6:6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go toward the west country, and the dappled ones go toward the south country."
38Zch 6:7 When the steeds came out, they were impatient to get off and patrol the earth. And he said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
38Zch 6:8 Then he cried out to me, "Lo, those who go toward the north country have set my spirit at rest in the north country."
38Zch 6:9 The word of the LORD came to me:
38Zch 6:10 Collect silver and gold from the exiles--from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah--who have arrived from Babylon; and go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
38Zch 6:11 Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak;
38Zch 6:12 say to him: Thus says the LORD of hosts: Here is a man whose name is Branch: for he shall branch out in his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD.
38Zch 6:13 It is he that shall build the temple of the LORD; he shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. There shall be a priest by his throne, with peaceful understanding between the two of them.
38Zch 6:14 And the crown shall be in the care of Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of the LORD.
38Zch 6:15 Those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
38Zch 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
38Zch 7:2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favor of the LORD,
38Zch 7:3 and to ask the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and the prophets, "Should I mourn and practice abstinence in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?"
38Zch 7:4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
38Zch 7:5 Say to all the people of the land and the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted?
38Zch 7:6 And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat and drink only for yourselves?
38Zch 7:7 Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, along with the towns around it, and when the Negeb and the Shephelah were inhabited?
38Zch 7:8 The word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying:
38Zch 7:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another;
38Zch 7:10 do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the alien, or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.
38Zch 7:11 But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears in order not to hear.
38Zch 7:12 They made their hearts adamant in order not to hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 7:13 Just as, when I called, they would not hear, so, when they called, I would not hear, says the LORD of hosts,
38Zch 7:14 and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and a pleasant land was made desolate.
38Zch 8:1 The word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying:
38Zch 8:2 Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
38Zch 8:3 Thus says the LORD: I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts shall be called the holy mountain.
38Zch 8:4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of their great age.
38Zch 8:5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
38Zch 8:6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Even though it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in these days, should it also seem impossible to me, says the LORD of hosts?
38Zch 8:7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: I will save my people from the east country and from the west country;
38Zch 8:8 and I will bring them to live in Jerusalem. They shall be my people and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.
38Zch 8:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong--you that have recently been hearing these words from the mouths of the prophets who were present when the foundation was laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 8:10 For before those days there were no wages for people or for animals, nor was there any safety from the foe for those who went out or came in, and I set them all against one other.
38Zch 8:11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the LORD of hosts.
38Zch 8:12 For there shall be a sowing of peace; the vine shall yield its fruit, the ground shall give its produce, and the skies shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
38Zch 8:13 Just as you have been a cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you and you shall be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.
38Zch 8:14 For thus says the LORD of hosts: Just as I purposed to bring disaster upon you, when your ancestors provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
38Zch 8:15 so again I have purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; do not be afraid.
38Zch 8:16 These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another, render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace,
38Zch 8:17 do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate, says the LORD.
38Zch 8:18 The word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying:
38Zch 8:19 Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be seasons of joy and gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah: therefore love truth and peace.
38Zch 8:20 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, the inhabitants of many cities;
38Zch 8:21 the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, "Come, let us go to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going."
38Zch 8:22 Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the LORD.
38Zch 8:23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from nations of every language shall take hold of a Jew, grasping his garment and saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."
38Zch 9:1 
38Zch 9:2 An Oracle. The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus. For to the LORD belongs the capital of Aram, as do all the tribes of Israel; Hamath also, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
38Zch 9:3 Tyre has built itself a rampart, and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
38Zch 9:4 But now, the Lord will strip it of its possessions and hurl its wealth into the sea, and it shall be devoured by fire.
38Zch 9:5 Ashkelon shall see it and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are withered. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;
38Zch 9:6 a mongrel people shall settle in Ashdod, and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.
38Zch 9:7 I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.
38Zch 9:8 Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that no one shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again overrun them, for now I have seen with my own eyes.
38Zch 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38Zch 9:10 He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
38Zch 9:11 As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
38Zch 9:12 Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
38Zch 9:13 For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will arouse your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword.
38Zch 9:14 Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
38Zch 9:15 The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour and tread down the slingers; they shall drink their blood like wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.
38Zch 9:16 On that day the LORD their God will save them for they are the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land.
38Zch 9:17 For what goodness and beauty are his! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women.
38Zch 10:1 Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain, from the LORD who makes the storm clouds, who gives showers of rain to you, the vegetation in the field to everyone.
38Zch 10:2 For the teraphim utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; the dreamers tell false dreams, and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they suffer for lack of a shepherd.
38Zch 10:3 My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD of hosts cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his proud war horse.
38Zch 10:4 Out of them shall come the cornerstone, out of them the tent peg, out of them the battle bow, out of them every commander.
38Zch 10:5 Together they shall be like warriors in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight, for the LORD is with them, and they shall put to shame the riders on horses.
38Zch 10:6 I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them; for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
38Zch 10:7 Then the people of Ephraim shall become like warriors, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and rejoice, their hearts shall exult in the LORD.
38Zch 10:8 I will signal for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as numerous as they were before.
38Zch 10:9 Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and they shall rear their children and return.
38Zch 10:10 I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria; I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, until there is no room for them.
38Zch 10:11 They shall pass through the sea of distress, and the waves of the sea shall be struck down, and all the depths of the Nile dried up. The pride of Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
38Zch 10:12 I will make them strong in the LORD, and they shall walk in his name, says the LORD.
38Zch 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars!
38Zch 11:2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled!
38Zch 11:3 Listen, the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is despoiled! Listen, the roar of the lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed!
38Zch 11:4 Thus said the LORD my God: Be a shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter.
38Zch 11:5 Those who buy them kill them and go unpunished; and those who sell them say, "Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich"; and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
38Zch 11:6 For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the earth, says the LORD. I will cause them, every one, to fall each into the hand of a neighbor, and each into the hand of the king; and they shall devastate the earth, and I will deliver no one from their hand.
38Zch 11:7 So, on behalf of the sheep merchants, I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. I took two staffs; one I named Favor, the other I named Unity, and I tended the sheep.
38Zch 11:8 In one month I disposed of the three shepherds, for I had become impatient with them, and they also detested me.
38Zch 11:9 So I said, "I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die; what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let those that are left devour the flesh of one another!"
38Zch 11:10 I took my staff Favor and broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
38Zch 11:11 So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep merchants, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD.
38Zch 11:12 I then said to them, "If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." So they weighed out as my wages thirty shekels of silver.
38Zch 11:13 Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it into the treasury"--this lordly price at which I was valued by them. So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them into the treasury in the house of the LORD.
38Zch 11:14 Then I broke my second staff Unity, annulling the family ties between Judah and Israel.
38Zch 11:15 Then the LORD said to me: Take once more the implements of a worthless shepherd.
38Zch 11:16 For I am now raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for the perishing, or seek the wandering, or heal the maimed, or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
38Zch 11:17 Oh, my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be completely withered, his right eye utterly blinded!
38Zch 12:1 
38Zch 12:2 An Oracle. The word of the LORD concerning Israel: Thus says the LORD, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the human spirit within: See, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling for all the surrounding peoples; it will be against Judah also in the siege against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:3 On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall grievously hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth shall come together against it.
38Zch 12:4 On that day, says the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But on the house of Judah I will keep a watchful eye, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
38Zch 12:5 Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, "The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the LORD of hosts, their God."
38Zch 12:6 On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot on a pile of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:7 And the LORD will give victory to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be exalted over that of Judah.
38Zch 12:8 On that day the LORD will shield the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the LORD, at their head.
38Zch 12:9 And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:10 And I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that, when they look on the one whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn.
38Zch 12:11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38Zch 12:12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38Zch 12:13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38Zch 12:14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
38Zch 13:1 On that day a fountain shall be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
38Zch 13:2 On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more; and also I will remove from the land the prophets and the unclean spirit.
38Zch 13:3 And if any prophets appear again, their fathers and mothers who bore them will say to them, "You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD"; and their fathers and their mothers who bore them shall pierce them through when they prophesy.
38Zch 13:4 On that day the prophets will be ashamed, every one, of their visions when they prophesy; they will not put on a hairy mantle in order to deceive,
38Zch 13:5 but each of them will say, "I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the soil; for the land has been my possession since my youth."
38Zch 13:6 And if anyone asks them, "What are these wounds on your chest?" the answer will be "The wounds I received in the house of my friends."
38Zch 13:7 "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is my associate," says the LORD of hosts. Strike the shepherd, that the sheep may be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones.
38Zch 13:8 In the whole land, says the LORD, two-thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one-third shall be left alive.
38Zch 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, "They are my people"; and they will say, "The LORD is our God."
38Zch 14:1 See, a day is coming for the LORD, when the plunder taken from you will be divided in your midst.
38Zch 14:2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses looted and the women raped; half the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
38Zch 14:3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle.
38Zch 14:4 On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives, which lies before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley; so that one half of the Mount shall withdraw northward, and the other half southward.
38Zch 14:5 And you shall flee by the valley of the LORD's mountain, for the valley between the mountains shall reach to Azal; and you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
38Zch 14:6 On that day there shall not be either cold or frost.
38Zch 14:7 And there shall be continuous day (it is known to the LORD), not day and not night, for at evening time there shall be light.
38Zch 14:8 On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; it shall continue in summer as in winter.
38Zch 14:9 And the LORD will become king over all the earth; on that day the LORD will be one and his name one.
38Zch 14:10 The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.
38Zch 14:11 And it shall be inhabited, for never again shall it be doomed to destruction; Jerusalem shall abide in security.
38Zch 14:12 This shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they are still on their feet; their eyes shall rot in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot in their mouths.
38Zch 14:13 On that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of a neighbor, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other;
38Zch 14:14 even Judah will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected--gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.
38Zch 14:15 And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever animals may be in those camps.
38Zch 14:16 Then all who survive of the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the festival of booths.
38Zch 14:17 If any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain upon them.
38Zch 14:18 And if the family of Egypt do not go up and present themselves, then on them shall come the plague that the LORD inflicts on the nations that do not go up to keep the festival of booths.
38Zch 14:19 Such shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to keep the festival of booths.
38Zch 14:20 On that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "Holy to the LORD." And the cooking pots in the house of the LORD shall be as holy as the bowls in front of the altar;
38Zch 14:21 and every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be sacred to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and use them to boil the flesh of the sacrifice. And there shall no longer be traders in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day.

39Mal 1:1 An oracle. The word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
39Mal 1:2 I have loved you, says the LORD. But you say, "How have you loved us?" Is not Esau Jacob's brother? says the LORD. Yet I have loved Jacob
39Mal 1:3 but I have hated Esau; I have made his hill country a desolation and his heritage a desert for jackals.
39Mal 1:4 If Edom says, "We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins," the LORD of hosts says: They may build, but I will tear down, until they are called the wicked country, the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.
39Mal 1:5 Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, "Great is the LORD beyond the borders of Israel!"
39Mal 1:6 A son honors his father, and servants their master. If then I am a father, where is the honor due me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. You say, "How have we despised your name?"
39Mal 1:7 By offering polluted food on my altar. And you say, "How have we polluted it?" By thinking that the LORD's table may be despised.
39Mal 1:8 When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not wrong? Try presenting that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:9 And now implore the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. The fault is yours. Will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:10 Oh, that someone among you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hands.
39Mal 1:11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 1:12 But you profane it when you say that the Lord's table is polluted, and the food for it may be despised.
39Mal 1:13 "What a weariness this is," you say, and you sniff at me, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD.
39Mal 1:14 Cursed be the cheat who has a male in the flock and vows to give it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished; for I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name is reverenced among the nations.
39Mal 2:1 And now, O priests, this command is for you.
39Mal 2:2 If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
39Mal 2:3 I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.
39Mal 2:4 Know, then, that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may hold, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 2:5 My covenant with him was a covenant of life and well-being, which I gave him; this called for reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.
39Mal 2:6 True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in integrity and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
39Mal 2:7 For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 2:8 But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,
39Mal 2:9 and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction.
39Mal 2:10 Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?
39Mal 2:11 Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
39Mal 2:12 May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob anyone who does this--any to witness or answer, or to bring an offering to the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 2:13 And this you do as well: You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor at your hand.
39Mal 2:14 You ask, "Why does he not?" Because the LORD was a witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
39Mal 2:15 Did not one God make her? Both flesh and spirit are his. And what does the one God desire? Godly offspring. So look to yourselves, and do not let anyone be faithless to the wife of his youth.
39Mal 2:16 For I hate divorce, says the LORD, the God of Israel, and covering one's garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless.
39Mal 2:17 You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "All who do evil are good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them." Or by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"
39Mal 3:1 See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight--indeed, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:2 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap;
39Mal 3:3 he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.
39Mal 3:4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
39Mal 3:5 Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be swift to bear witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in their wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the alien, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:6 For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, have not perished.
39Mal 3:7 Ever since the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, "How shall we return?"
39Mal 3:8 Will anyone rob God? Yet you are robbing me! But you say, "How are we robbing you?" In your tithes and offerings!
39Mal 3:9 You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me--the whole nation of you!
39Mal 3:10 Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house, and thus put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts; see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing.
39Mal 3:11 I will rebuke the locust for you, so that it will not destroy the produce of your soil; and your vine in the field shall not be barren, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:12 Then all nations will count you happy, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 3:13 You have spoken harsh words against me, says the LORD. Yet you say, "How have we spoken against you?"
39Mal 3:14 You have said, "It is vain to serve God. What do we profit by keeping his command or by going about as mourners before the LORD of hosts?
39Mal 3:15 Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape."
39Mal 3:16 Then those who revered the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD took note and listened, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who revered the LORD and thought on his name.
39Mal 3:17 They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act, and I will spare them as parents spare their children who serve them.
39Mal 3:18 Then once more you shall see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
39Mal 4:1 See, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
39Mal 4:2 But for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.
39Mal 4:3 And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts.
39Mal 4:4 Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.
39Mal 4:5 Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.
39Mal 4:6 He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse.
