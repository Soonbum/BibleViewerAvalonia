18Jb 13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this], mine ear hath heard and understood it.
18Jb 13:2 What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I [am] not inferior unto you.
18Jb 13:3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
18Jb 13:4 But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye [are] all physicians of no value.
18Jb 13:5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
18Jb 13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
18Jb 13:7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
18Jb 13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
18Jb 13:9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye [so] mock him?
18Jb 13:10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
18Jb 13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
18Jb 13:12 Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
18Jb 13:13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what [will].
18Jb 13:14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
18Jb 13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
18Jb 13:16 He also [shall be] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
18Jb 13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
18Jb 13:18 Behold now, I have ordered [my] cause; I know that I shall be justified.
18Jb 13:19 Who [is] he [that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
18Jb 13:20 Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
18Jb 13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
18Jb 13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
18Jb 13:23 How many [are] mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
18Jb 13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
18Jb 13:26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
18Jb 13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
